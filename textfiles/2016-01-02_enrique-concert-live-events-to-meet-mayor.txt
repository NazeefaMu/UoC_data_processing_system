Live Events Ltd., the organizers of Enrique Iglesias Concert, which is in the centre of a controversy over allegations of non-payment of entertainment tax is expected to meet Colombo Mayor M.J.M. Muzammil to discuss the matter.
Mr. Muzzamil said the meeting would take place in a day or two and the final decision on taking legal action against the company would depend on the outcome of this meeting.
“We will decide on what needs to be done after meeting the event planners,” he said.
Mr. Muzzamil said the company was also duty bound to pay compensation to those who attended the concert and were inconvenienced without seats.
“Even those who had bought high priced tickets did not have a seat at the show and that’s not how things are done,” he said.
Earlier, the CMC threatened to take legal action against the company to recover Rs.29 million owed to the council and had also blacklisted the company.
The CMC accused the company of issuing more than 10,000 tickets after an assurance that only 7,130 tickets would be issued. (Yohan Perera)
