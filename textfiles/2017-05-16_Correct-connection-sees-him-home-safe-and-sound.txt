This Johnny who once served on the personal staff of a former political heavyweight was lucky enough to get an overseas posting and was serving in a diplomatic mission abroad when a arrest warrant was issued for his alleged complicity in a serious fraud. 




Soon after the regime change here, Johnny skipped the host country for parts unknown. 


Lady Luck smiled on our man again when he managed to pally up with the sibling of a leading political authority here and thanks to the latter’s patronage, he returned to the country without the long arm of the law making any trouble for him. And in fact, an elite security detail is said to have escorted him from the airport to his residence.


Meanwhile, the arrest warrant issued by court has become a virtual dead letter. The fugitive from the law is said to be one with ties to the country’s legal sector.
