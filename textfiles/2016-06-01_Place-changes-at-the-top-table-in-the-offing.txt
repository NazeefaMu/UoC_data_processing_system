Place-changes at the top table in the offing?


	



 

There is speculation in political circles that a reshuffle of the team at the top table is round the corner. 

 


The top men in the highest echelons who held a powwow recently had agreed on the need to give priority to replacing holders of two subjects with new faces, they say.


One of the two subjects due to change hands is closely connected to finance and the other to the travel sector and both Ministries are located in close proximity to the shoreline, they say. 


The incumbents are from the Green party.


The Big Boss himself had expressed his displeasure at the poor showing by the two purohitas. He had also invited his second in command to take over finance adding that they should find a suitable person to take over the other subject.
