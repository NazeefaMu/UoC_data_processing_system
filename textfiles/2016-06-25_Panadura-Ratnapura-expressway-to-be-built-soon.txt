The survey work for the acquisition of land is now underway for the launch of the Panadura–Ratnapura Expressway project, Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella said.

Mr. Kiriella said the work on the elevated road project between Kelaniya-Rajagiriya and the Colombo-Kandy Expressway would also commence soon.

The construction of an expressway linking Panadura and Ratnapura was proposed during the previous regime. Once constructed, the travel time between the two cities would be reduced to half an hour. (KB)
