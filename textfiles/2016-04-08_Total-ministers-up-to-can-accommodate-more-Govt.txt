The government formally informed Parliament yesterday that there were as many as 92 Ministers, deputy ministers and state ministers, and doors were open to accommodate further crossovers from the opposition to increase the number if necessary.

In the aftermath of the appointment of two deputy ministers and a state minister, National Freedom Party (NFF) Leader Wimal Weerawansa asked on Wednesday how the number could be increased in this manner despite constitutional restrictions placed in the 19th Amendment.

He also asked the government to reveal the exact number of ministers, deputy ministers and state ministers serving in the government at the moment.

The government leaders said it would be done the following day after formal inquiries from the authorities concerned.

Accordingly, Joint Opposition MP Mahinda Yapa Abeywardane made a reminder about it when the House met yesterday.

Chief Government Whip Gayantha Karunatilake said 47 Cabinet Ministers including the President, 20 state ministers and 25 deputy ministers had been appointed at the moment.

"There is scope to increase of the number. Therefore, doors are open to accommodate anyone willing to join the government," he said. (Kelum Bandara and Yohan Perera)
