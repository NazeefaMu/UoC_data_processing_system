UPFA MP Ranjith De Zoysa said the UNP members had assaulted the officials and tried to disrupt the elections being held yesterday for Warayaya, Welkeniyaya, Ambawila and Amitiyagda Divisional areas at the Ambawila Wajirama Temple, while Police officers were at the scene.

However, he said despite the interruption, the UPFA led Joint Opposition was able to win 29 seats in all four Divisions of the Godakawela Cooperative Society.

The Provincial Cooperative Department had postponed the elections for remaining 19 Divisional areas following the situation.
