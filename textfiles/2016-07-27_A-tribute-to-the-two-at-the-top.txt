A tribute to the two at the top


	

The Big Boss recently paid a private visit to the land of our last colonial master. 


Incidentally, he had earlier issued strict instructions to his aides to ensure that no public funds were spent on any matter connected with his visit.


After attending to the purpose of his visit, the Big Boss decided to take a brief holiday in this foreign land. So he took a small cottage on rent and took a taxi to go shopping. 


The big man visited several shopping malls and queued up like an ordinary customer to pay the bill at the counter. He came across several compatriots as well while being outside the malls looking around to hail a taxi, they say. 


On hearing all about the foreign private visit of the Big Boss, a senior purohita remarked: “Sri Lanka is fortunate that the country’s twosome at the top don’t use their privileges of office to meet their private ends!”
