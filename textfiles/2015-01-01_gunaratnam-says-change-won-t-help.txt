	Frontline Socialist Party (FSP) politburo member Kumar Gunaratnam today vowed to continue politics in Sri Lanka and said replacing the Mahinda Rakapaksa Government with a Maithripala Sirisena Government would only provide temporary relief to the burning issues in this country.
	“It will be like an interval in hell. People are fed up with one rule and are so eager for a change. The so called change would not provide lasting solutions to the plight of the people. It would only provide temporary relief,” he told a news conference in Colombo today.
	Mr. Gunaratnam, who was deported from Sri Lanka in 2012, returned to the country this morning. He said there was a political force which delayed his return.
