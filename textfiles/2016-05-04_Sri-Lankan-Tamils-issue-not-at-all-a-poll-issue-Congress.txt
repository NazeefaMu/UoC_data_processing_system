‘Sri Lankan Tamils issue not at all a poll issue’: Congress


	

The Sri Lankan Tamils issue is not at all a poll issue in the Assembly elections, said Congress leader K. V. Thangkabalu.

This was not a poll issue even way back in the 2009 Lok Sabha elections, when the problem was at its peak in the island nation. The Sri Lankan Tamils issue had taken a back seat then.

The DMK-Congress alliance under the UPA registered comfortable win in a majority of Lok Sabha constituencies in the State in that election, he said. It continues to be non-issue as far as Tamil Nadu elections are concerned, he said.

Mr. Thangkabalu said that it was regrettable that the AIADMK preferred to present a petition to the Chief Election Commissioner opposing the transfer of IAS and IPS officials in the State.

The Election Commission in the 2011 Assembly elections transferred many IAS and IPS officers at the instance of the AIADMK, he recalled.

Mr. Thangkabalu said that the Jayalalithaa regime had done nothing to augment power production in the State.(The Hindu)
