N. Kores, (Daily Mail), 9 June 2017 - North Korea has successfully tested a new ‘ground-to-sea cruise rocket’, according to state media.  


The KCNA news agency declared today that the rocket was ‘capable of striking any enemy group of battleships attempting a military attack on the DPRK.’   


This marks the fifth test in less than a month and comes less than a week after the United Nations expanded sanctions against the country. The state news agency described the new missile as a ‘powerful attack means.’   


It added that the missiles were ‘accurately detected and hit the floating targets on the East Sea of Korea.’   


The missile had previously been seen during the giant military parade held in April to mark the 105th birthday of the country’s founder Kim Il-sung, according to South Korean media.
