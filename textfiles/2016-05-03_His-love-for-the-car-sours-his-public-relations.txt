Some people are so fond of their vehicle, they take meticulous care to prevent even a fender bender happening to it. There is a senior Minister hailing from Wayamba, who is one of such people crazy about the vehicle he uses.

 


Large crowds visit his residence in his home town on the Public Day set apart by him and the purohita invariably keeps a watchful eye on his car parked opposite the residence on such Days, while listening to the problems of the people calling on him. And if he notices anyone leaning against his car, he would immediately get up and call out: “Malli, please don’t lean against the car!”


Some people openly wonder why the purohita does not garage his vehicle or park it in a safe place, if he is so fond of it!
