UPFA MP Udaya Gammanpila said today that action should be taken against the “young female Parliamentarian’ in connection with the abduction of a man in Dematagoda on Monday afternoon.
He said it appears she was above the law. “Is this Yahapalanaya?” he asked.
Addressing a news conference at the Dr. N.M. Perera Centre, Parliamentarian Gammanpila said the Defender vehicle, which had been used to abduct the youth, belonged to this MP and that it was her supporters who had abducted the youth.
“The abducted youth had been kept in an office belonging to the young Parliamentarian. She had admitted to intervening into a family dispute and giving advice to the abducted. If this was any other person, legal action would have been taken already. But still no action had been taken against her,” he said.
He said the UNP had charged the previous UPFA government of entertaining a white-van culture to abduct people and to carry out other illegal activities.
“We only ended the white van culture which was introduced by the UNP. Today, they have launched a ‘black Defender’ culture to replace white-van culture,” he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
