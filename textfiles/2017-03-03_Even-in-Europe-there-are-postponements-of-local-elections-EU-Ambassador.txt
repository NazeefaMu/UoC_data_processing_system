Even in Europe, there are postponements of local elections  - EU Ambassador


	

The European Union Ambassador, Tung-Lai MARGUE, in an interview with the Daily Mirror, outlines that the current government is on the right track and has made many improvements. He also articulates the EU position on the GSP + trade facility and future cooperation. Excerpts of the interview follow.



How do you look at the present status of relations between the European Union and Sri Lanka?  

We all know there has been a tremendous improvement in our relationship since 2015. The fact is that these relations were not very good earlier. It was very difficult to find areas of cooperation. The improvement in relations has very much to do with the new government that came into power with the agenda for reforms. You know the EU has been supporting this government. We continue to support it for further reforms. We believe this government has made progress in a number of areas. There have been a lot of improvements. There still need to be further steps taken in a number of areas. Fundamentally, they are on the right track. This has had a positive impact on our relationship. There has been support from the highest level - the European Heads of European institutions and the Foreign Affairs Ministers. We are consolidating our policy dialogue, which is an important element. This is not just people meeting and chatting. Trade, of course, is an important element. It is connected to GSP plus. Development cooperation is also an important element. This is taking place in a structured way.  
We are close partners. We really hope that in the coming months, a number of commitments that have been made will be realized.  

How do you specifically analyse the performance of the government in terms of fulfilling pledges made to the international community and others?  

Well, it is a process. It is a difficult process without any doubt. You know there are a number of challenges. Constitutional reforms are among them. However, we expect that in the context of international forums such as the UN and the commitments made by the government which cosponsored the resolution, it will deliver on these commitments to its people. All these commitments are made for the people of Sri Lanka and for reconciliation, so that there is no reverting to war or conflict.   

The government is to seek an extension of the timeline for the implementation of these commitments. Will the EU support it?  

It is not for me to say what the position of the EU will be. This is still under debate. We are starting the process in Geneva. What I would like to say is that this government has not had a lot of time to put into place the commitments mentioned in the resolution. Perhaps the timeline was overambitious. But I am quite sure the outcome will be positive. There is no way to make a U-turn.  

 

 

"In the coming years, I am quite sure there will be tremendous development in trade between the EU and the countries in the region here"


 

How hopeful are you that this government will deliver on those lines?  

 You can see things in two ways. I think you can look at the glass as being half empty or half full. We believe it is half full. We believe more progress on issues is in the pipeline. There have been a number of improvements that we have noted, particularity in terms of legislation and the ratification of a number of international conventions. That is very welcome. 
The Office of Missing Persons is a good element, although it has not been implemented. There are a number of positive signals. We would like the constitutional reforms to proceed because these were part of major commitments made by the President when he campaigned. These are also commitments made by the coalition government. What is so important is that they address the key issues that need to be looked at if the country wants to have a prosperous future in terms of devolution, the role of the presidency and electoral reforms. These elements are key components in terms of ensuring reconciliation.   

When it comes to the constitution-making process, how does the EU cooperate with the government?  

First of all, this is the role of the government. They have ownership of it. Whenever they request assistance, we can help in terms of capacity building and expertise. Beyond that, is for the government to do.  

We have observed stark policy differences between the two parties- one headed by the President and the other by the Prime Minister - regarding the contours of the new Constitution. How do you look at it?  

I remain optimistic. Yes, we are reading and learning of things that can sometimes be surprising. I know the complexity of internal policy in this country is high. It is clear that coalition parties sometimes have divergent views. It needs strong leadership. It is the case with trade policy. Certain parties are more for liberal economic approaches, whereas others want to protect existing rights in certain areas and the policy is less clear on what is to be done to State-owned enterprises.  

There are announcements that Sri Lanka is likely to get the GSP plus benefit. There are commitments made by the government in this regard. How far has the government implemented these commitments to secure the facility?  

As you know, the European Commission has given the green light to the request by Sri Lanka to get the GSP plus. But it is not the end of the process. There has very recently been a request for a two-month extension of the period in order that things may be assessed more carefully by the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers. So, it is for these two bodies to make a decision in the coming weeks. There are areas where we would like to see further progress. The European Parliament is eager to look at the outcome of the UN resolution. This will take place before the end of the assessment period.  


	Tremendous improvement in EU-SL relations under new Govt.
	
	
	There are still areas needing further progress
	
	
	The Govt. is on right track
	
	
	Remains positive that Sri Lanka will get GSP 
	

 

What is the period actually?  

It is up to mid-May. The European Parliament and the Council have to say whether they are in agreement with the Commission’s position.   

 

 

"The European Commission has given the green light to the request by Sri Lanka to get the GSP plus. But it is not the end of the process "

 

There are 27 international conventions to be ratified by the government of 
Sri Lanka.  

These are to be ratified and implemented. These are conventions applied to all countries which apply for the GSP + benefit. This is not something we have tailored specifically for Sri Lanka. These are conditions every country wanting to get GSP plus agrees to fulfil.  

Is the repeal of the Prevention of Terrorism Act to be replaced with a new counter-terrorism law as part of them?  

It is part of a key convention. If you look at the international obligation there, it is not that the convention prohibits the government from having counter-terrorism measures or provisions. It is allowed because you know that terrorism is a key threat to a number of countries, not solely for Sri Lanka. The matter is not about having measures. These measures need to be proportionate and respect key aspects of human rights, including how suspects should be handled, detained and produced for trial. These are the kinds of elements we are looking for.  
The government has promised to change the Prevention of Terrorism Act in accordance with the international standards on human rights. We have a formal commitment from the Prime Minister that this will be happening with the agreement of the Sri Lankan Parliament.   

In your analysis, how beneficial will the GSP+ be for Sri Lanka?  

Well, I think it is obvious that if you get it, you will be allowed to export to the world’s largest trading block without any tariffs on your products apart from a few agricultural products. It is going to be a tremendous advantage. You need to realize that there are only eight countries in the world that presently have GSP plus. I am sure that Sri Lankan entrepreneurs will take advantage of it. This does not mean that they will not have to put in all the effort to be at the highest level of phytosanitary and sanitary conditions. These are standards that need to be respected.   

How do you look at the total economic potential of the EU in the current context, in which it is embroiled in its own problems with one country leaving it and some others threatening to leave?   

So far, there is only one certainty. That is Brexit. Other elements are parts of political debates. I do not see a major risk of other countries leaving the EU. What is clear is that even with the departure of the UK, the EU remains a very important player at the international level. You talk about countries leaving. I also see countries that are waiting to enter the EU. This also needs to be considered. Bosnia and Serbia are two examples. 

What is the total economic potential of the EU in the context of new emerging economic powerhouses in the world?  

You should not underestimate the capacity of the EU enterprises in certain key areas. We lead in terms of research and new technology. In the coming years, I am quite sure there will be tremendous development in trade between the EU and the countries in the region here. We  have just concluded an FTA with Canada. I also understand that Japan and Mexico are very keen to conclude FTAs with the EU.   

The new government is hailed by some sections of the international community for restoring democracy. Elections are a key element of democracy. However, the local government elections have been postponed. What is your position on it?  

Even in Europe, there are postponements of local elections. I am not trying to interfere with the decision-making process of Sri Lanka. Obviously, if there has been a commitment by this government to hold local government elections, it should take place in the interests of democracy. My role here is not to say what the reasons are and what should be done.
