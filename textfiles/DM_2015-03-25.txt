A novel situation, says Modi
	
	
	Indian Prime Minister Modi met a number of politicos from both sides of the great divide here during his four-day visit.
Among the politicos whom Modi met was a group of Diyawanna members from the main opposition. The venue of this meeting was a leading hotel in Colombo. During the usual exchange of pleasantries, Modi had inquired from the Diyawanna members who was their party leader. Our party leader is the President, they had replied. Visibly taken aback by this reply, the Indian PM had again asked: Does the government command a majority in the House No. We are the majority in the House, the Diyawanna members replied.
Then who is running the government now
Those in the opposition then are now running the government.
Ah! A novel situation! I was bowled over for a moment! said Modi with a smile.

A tale about a controversial letter
	
	The secretarial one responsible for Defence has messed up the Avant-Garde affair into a veritable tangle. They say.
This high up wrote a letter granting permission to the Avant-Garde Chief to travel abroad despite there already being a taboo against his leaving the country. The Secretarial one did not stop at granting permission. He also asserted that the foreign trip of the Chief was imperative as it would result in foreign investment to the country. However, a Ministerial type who was keeping an eagle eye on the Avant-Garde affair could access the contents of this letter before it could reach the relevant authority.
The Secretarial one was shaken when he learnt that the eagle-eyed Ministerial type accessed the contents of the letter. He immediately consigned the letter to the WPB and wrote another letter. He said in this second letter he was granting permission to the Avant-garde Chief to leave the country subject to the approval of the Chief Attorney for the government. The Ministerial type got a copy of that letter as well and showed it to the former Madam.
The former Madam, was livid when she saw the copy of the letter. She immediately rang up the secretarial one and gave him a shelling. She later told the highest authority to get rid of the blundering official in the name of good governance.

Close liquor bars, order sends some politicos into a flutter
	
	The new Big Boss the other day ordered the immediate closure of 349 liquor outlets identified as being located in close proximity to schools and places of religious worship across the country.
This order from the highest authority in the country has sent many politicos, mostly from the Diyawanna House into a flutter.
These highly agitated politicos - numbering about 40 hailing from both sides of the great divide  held council to find a way out of this sudden predicament.
Some of these politicos run about 7 to 8 taverns each and among them are owners of illicit distilleries as well, they say. A Diyawanna member from Wayamba is said to be the owner of more than 20 liquor outlets. These liquor outlet owners have now decided to make a collective plea to the new Big Boss to go soft on them.

	Cricket fever is running high these days. And every one here believed that our national team stood a good chance of winning the World Cup. In fact, the new Big Boss and the second in- command informed the cricket authorities here of their desire to convey their well wishes to our lads in action.
The Cricket Chair in office and the Executive boss duly arranged for the top duo to skype their greetings to the team. Skyping over, the new Big Boss invited the Chair, the secretarial one and the executive boss for a confab. During the conversation that ensued, the cricket bigwigs invited the new Big Boss to the Cup Finals in case the national team entered the finals. The new Big Boss said: Sorry. I think I have to miss the pleasure, because by that time, I might be on my planned official visit to China. On second thoughts, he inquired from the bigwigs the date and the time fixed for the Cup Finals. Pat came the answer to the query from the secretarial one. It will be a day match to be played on. 
Meanwhile, the cricket Chair who consulted the Cup series schedule said: Sir, this will be a day and night match. However, the secretarial one who did not want to be outdone, insisted that it would be a day and night one. However, the Chair stood his ground.
Later, the new Big Boss got his aides to make discreet inquiries as to the scheduled time of the Cup Finals. And he was informed that it would be a day and night match. The cricket secretarial one lost face once again by trying to show off to the new Big Boss, they say.

Head of Govt. not specified
	
	Cabinet approval has been granted to include a change to the draft of the 19th Amendment, through which the Head of the Government has not been specified leading to a further curtailing of executive powers, although the President will remain the Head of State and Commander-in-Chief.
	Cabinet Spokesman and Minister Rajitha Senaratne speaking told a news conference yesterday that the issue of the 19th Amendment draft was with concern to which position should be named the Head of the Government.
	Earlier, the President was named the Head of State, the Commander of the tri-forces, head of the Executive and the Head of the Government. But following the change approved by the cabinet, no elaboration has been done on who the Head of Government should be  it will depend on the availability of the President and the Prime Minister, he said.
	The minister said even in countries such as Korea, it was not elaborated whether it was the President or the Prime Minister who should hold the leadership of the government.
	Except for Minister Champika Ranawaka, all other members of the cabinet agreed to this change to be included in the 19A draft since we explained that during the campaigning period our pledge was to either abolish the Executive Presidency or to curtail executive powers. Therefore, if the presidential system is to be maintained, the Executive powers of the position need to be curtailed, which we have included in the draft by removing immunity and making the presidency accountable to Parliament, he said.
	The minister said these were the main clauses that they had been campaigning for since the 1970s.(Lakna Paranamanna)

Imm. Dept. receives 10 dual citizenship applications
	
	With the governments decision to reintroduce dual citizenship status to nine countries, the Department of Immigration and Emigration had already received about 10 such applications by yesterday.
	A senior Immigration official told the Daily Mirror that since Monday the department had received applications which were being subjected to examination.
	Minister of Public Order, John Amaratunga announced on Monday that the issuing of dual citizenship which had been suspended by the previous regime since September 2011 was recommenced and that anybody could apply.
	As a result a person whose citizenship of Sri Lanka has ceased under Sections 19, 20 and 21 of Citizenship Act No. 18 of 1948 or a person whose citizenship in Sri Lanka is likely to cease, can apply for a dual citizenship.
	But the applicants have to be from any of the nine countries, USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, UK, France, Sweden, Switzerland and Italy to apply for a dual citizenship.
	Those were the only countries that had consented to its citizens having dual citizenship with Sri Lanka.
	The status will be issued under two categories as resumption and retention. Under resumption, a person whose citizenship in Sri Lanka which had ceased due to obtaining a citizenship of another country, could resume the status of citizenship in Sri Lanka.
	Anyone who intends to obtain citizenship could retain his Sri Lankan citizenship by applying through the retention. The details on the criterion for applications could be obtained from the website www.immigration.gov.lk (Kurulu Koojana Kariyakarawana)

This Blue man now leading the opposition, in a surprise turnaround of late has begun singing the praises of the deposed Big Boss.
Intrigued by the sudden change in the opposition bigwig, several Blue Diyawanna members who had made discreet inquiries have discovered the reason behind this turnaround; the opposition heavyweight had to face the wrath of party activists at a district party seminar held at his home turf for his hostile attitude towards the deposed Big Boss. The angry activists had bluntly told the Blue bigwig that there is no future for the party sans the leadership of the deposed Big Boss.

The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) said today the Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) General Secretary Patali Champika Ranawaka should disclose whether he wanted demon like powers to remain with the Executive Presidency as the JHU was against the 19th Amendment.
JVP General Secretary Tilvin Silva said Minister Ranawakas argument was that the 19th Amendment would create the president powerless and that was why they were against the Amendment in its present form. 
The main demand during the presidential election campaign was to abolish the Executive Presidency. Today, we have come close to pruning some of its powers but the JHU still wants the President to head the government, the state and the armed forces. It is uncertain whether it wants the president to proceed with excessive demon like powers like the way former President functioned, Mr. Silva told a news conference at JVP Head Office in Pelawatta, Battaramulla.
He said Mr. Ranawaka had voted against the 17th Amendment but had voted in favour of the 18th Amendment without any hesitation. The 18th Amendment was a blow to democracy. The latest constitutional reforms provide an opportunity to rectify previous mistakes, he said.
Commenting on the expansion of the Cabinet with the appointment of 26 Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) parliamentarians on Sunday, Mr. Silva said it seemed the government was following the footsteps of the previous government. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

It is an open secret that the government high ups are keen on finding an answer to this question. However, they are certain that whatever they talked about is something politically significant for both countries.
Meanwhile, a story coming down the grapevine says that Modi gave a signal to the new government here by having an exclusive meeting with the deposed Big Boss. Incidentally the deposed Big Boss is enigmatically mum about the contents of the talks he had with Modi.
However, there is speculation that the deposed Big Boss is due to visit India shortly as a distinguished guest of Prime Minister Modi. Of course, it is too early to say anything about his itinerary in India.

	The Government is hoping to re-introduce the Parliamentary Committee System after the upcoming general election, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said today.
	He said this committee system was introduced to Sri Lanka by the Donoughmore Constitution in 1931 and it existed till 1947.
	Premier Wickremesinghe made these comments at a ceremony held at Temple Trees last morning to distribute motorcycles to local government members.
	He said the appointment of ministers from the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) was to see how the political parties could work together and pointed out that these parties could play a role in governance after the next elections by participating in the Parliamentary Committee System.
	Under this system some of the political party representatives will be appointed as ministers and deputy ministers while those members who do not accept portfolios can head the 20 new parliamentary committees. The the cinisters and the Committee Chiefs will meet from time to time and take policy decisions. These committees will be given the responsibility to take such policy decisions, he said.
	Justifying the appointment of Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) MPs as Ministers, the Prime Minister said President Maithripala Sirisena had no choice but to give them ministerial portfolios as they were the ones currently in Parliament.
	President has to appoint those in Parliament as ministers according to the constitution, the Prime Minister said
	He said appointing of SLFPers as Ministers was not a new thing as they were offered portfolios in January prior to the forming of the new government. We offered them portfolios but they were not ready to accept them at that time, he said.
	Public Administration Minister Karu Jayasuriya said the governments intention was to provide motorcycles to all local government members irrespective of the party they represented.

	The FFID investigating into several major cases related to the Divi Neguma Department which functioned under the Ministry of Economic Development requires the subject minister to record a statement over various allegations levelled against him.
	The police will seek a court order to get Mr. Rajapaksa who is believed to be living in the US enjoying a three-month vacation approved by Parliament.

	Director General R.R.K. Ranawaka when interrogated by the FFID revealed that it was the then Minister Rajapaksa who ordered him to release large sums of money for various programmes during the past few years.
	The FFID is investigating the major expenses incurred by the department including money spent for the Presidential Election, an allowance paid to Divi Neguma officers, renovation of houses and spending more than Rs.70 million to a Divi Neguma national convention headed by the Minister.
	Rs.300,000 had been spent to transport three officers from Ampara to Colombo for this convention.

	There were 28 hopefuls set to enter the fray for Maha Nilame office of the main Devalaya in the Deep South. Certain interested parties in Moneragala were already thick in the battle on behalf of a political heavyweight from the district. This runner had the blessings of certain Buddhist prelates as well.
Then came as a bolt from the blue an announcement from the Buddha Sasana authorities that the original taboo for holders of political office to seek Nilame post is back in force. And this upset the apple cart of the Moneragala campaigners. Meanwhile, a rumour says that revalidating the original taboo was a move to prevent a certain Bandara from making a successful bid for the Nilame post. This Bandara hailing from Moneragala is said to be a Saji loyalist.

The concerned ones had later taken the issue to the authority at Cabinet level and the latter had told them that they re-introduced the taboo by way of delivering on an election promise. But the disappointed ones say that no such promise was held out during the last big poll campaign.

Video: Malaka says he will definitely enter politics
	
	Former Minister Mervyn Silvas son Malaka who is known to have been in the midst of several controversies said he would be entering politics from any political party willing to nominate him.
	Yes I am definitely coming into politics, he said when asked by journalists outside the Colombo Magistrates Court.
	On Tuesday Malaka Silva sought a removal of the bail conditions imposed on him, after he was alleged to have assaulted a foreigner at a night club in Colombo.
	A ruling on his application was fixed for May 27 by the Additional Magistrate of Colombo.
	Gotabaya Rajapaksa has said the foreigner had hit me hard enough for my nose to break. So if that was the case, then how is it that the victim was remanded while the assailant still roams outside, he asked.
	This was the first time that Malaka had responded to some questions while outside the court room, after numerous appearances in Sri Lankan courts in the recent past.
	My nose has been broken more than 5 or 6 times and now its like rubber. I can take a beating, thats not a problem. The issue is that I was hospitalised after I was injured. I want to live in Sri Lanka as a normal humanbeing. It is not about going into night clubs, its about leading a normal life, he said speaking of his application to Court on attending night clubs.
	When asked by Journalists about his intention to enter politics, he said he was interested and that he had great respect for former Presidents Mahinda Rajapaksa and Chandrika Kumaratunga.
	When questioned about the verbal assault by his father, on Chandrika Kumaratunga, Malaka denied it and said his father was only defending him.
	Where has he scolded Chandrika He never did that. There was a small issue after Chandrika called me a moda putha (foolish son). Then he as a father defended me, but thats all that happened, he said.
	During the previous regime, the then Minister Mervyn Silva had lashed out at Ms. Kumaratunga making disparaging remarks about her character.
	
	Malaka Silva, the son of the former minister, Mervyn Silva has been a newsmaker. He is a notorious character constantly involved in brawls. Last week there was talk about him. Here are excerpts from an interview with him:Q: What are you doing nowA: Helping my father with the next election.Q: Earlier you said you would enter politicsA: Yes, I have not changed my mind about it.Q: Did you change your initial idea of contesting from the Matara DistrictA: No. I will contest at least a provincial council election. Currently, I am helping my father.Q: It is Malaka Silva who comes to mind when talking about nigh clubsA: You might remember that I had a problem with an army major. After the court case involving that incident was over, I went with him in the same vehicle. We threw a party as well after that. I am like a bottle of soda fizzling out within a matter of few minutes. That is it. After that, I faced numerous other problems. When I went to a leading textile shop, I was assaulted by 11 persons.
	Regarding the last night club incident implicating me, it was reported in the newspapers that I assaulted someone called Sudda. Actually, what happened is the exact opposite. The complainant has been portrayed as the accused.
	Gotabaya Mahattaya had told the media that my nose had been broken. I was under treatment in the ICU of the hospital. I was imprisoned as well. What a ruthless man!Q: With whom did you have problemsA: With Gotabaya. For what reason does this old man fight with me, a young man I have never spoken to him. In which country is a person was imprisoned after being assaulted What will Sudda think about our country He will think that the assaulted was remanded and that this is a wonderful country. On the other hand, he did not come to court on several occasions. He was informed by the court to respect the court. I am not afraid of fighting. If they come one by one it is not a big thing. I was assaulted after I had turned back. I did not see. According to the law of Sri Lanka, it is a grave crime to break the bone of a person. My nose was broken.Q: You might have done something wrongA: Then the other person should have been injured. This is political revenge. The police made allegations against me.Q: What is this revengeA: I was cornered because they thought that my father would switch his allegiance to another party. My father did not change the party because he was afraid that something would happen to me in the prison. Father made a request to the president to release me. There was an identification parade. Anybody can identify me from my website. The parade was a sham. I respect the judiciary. As soon as I was released, I was sent abroad. Then my father acted discreetly to defeat the party for a regime change.Q: But you and your father considered former president Mahinda Rajapaksa a divine figure.A: I do not forget the favours done by the former president and Chandrika Methiniya. I still remember them.Q: Your father is said to have smashed coconuts as a ritual to seek divine intervention to defeat Mahinda Rajapaksa.A: Gotabaya and Basil did a lot of nasty things to my father. They harassed my father. I was also harassed. Basil did not harass me but harassed my father. Gotabaya followed me.
