Another rags-to-riches story!


	



 

A story doing rounds in political circles says that a powerful politico from the central hills had recently purchased a block of 109-perch prime land in the city at Rs. 3 million a perch.

 


The politico is said to be the owner of three residences in the city alone. He also owns lands and other property including a posh mansion in Kandy and several other towns in the upcountry, they say. 


It is a source of wonderment to many as to how this politico who once could not afford to buy a push cycle to come to Kandy could amass such immense wealth within so short a time. This politico eternally at loggerheads with a holder of high office in the upcountry is said to be planning to take up residence abroad as it is a cinch that he would lose at the upcoming polls.
