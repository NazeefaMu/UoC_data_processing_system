Weaving together the personal experiences and stories of combatants actively engaged on either side of Sri Lanka’s ethnic conflict, a Sri Lankan researcher and author, Sarah Kabir would launch Voices of Peace today, September 26, 2018 at 5.30 p.m. at the Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute.  

Aimed at supporting lasting peace and advancing the difficult work of national reconciliation in a post-war Sri Lanka, Voices of Peace shares the stories of ten former LTTE cadres and 10 Sri Lankan Military personnel, who were each actively engaged in the conflict providing a cathartic platform for these unheard voices to share their stories and provide readers with an objective and compassionate window into the protracted conflict.  

In sharing these stories, the author hopes to encourage empathy, meaningful public discussion and the continuation of dialogue between individuals, communities, and the nation as a whole, in order to positively influence national policy on peace and reconciliation.  

Eminent guest speakers Dr. Vinya Ariyaratne, Dr. Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu, Aaranya Rajasingam and Saliya Pieris PC, will participate in a panel discussion focused on acknowledging the experience and plight of these individuals as well as on broader themes of peace and national reconciliation in a post-conflict Sri Lanka.  

The discussion will be moderated by Executive Director at National Peace Council of Sri Lanka, Dr. Jehan Perera.  

Sarah Kabir is a researcher and humanitarian worker. She has a BSc in Social Policy from the University of Bristol and an MSc in International Development and Humanitarian Emergencies from the London School of Economics. After her Masters, she worked on peace-building and development work.
