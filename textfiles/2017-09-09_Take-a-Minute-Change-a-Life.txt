The World Health Organisation (WHO) claims that more lives are lost due to suicide than both war and homicide combined. 

More than 1 million people take their lives every year.

Such alarming statistics signal to one thing – prevention of suicide is an extremely important and urgent issue that needs to be addressed by society as a whole.


 

 

September 10 is marked as World Suicide Prevention Day and it has been so ever since its successful launch in September 2003. 


Suicide is one of the main causes of untimely and unnecessary deaths the world over, and a special day has been ear marked to create public awareness so that more can be done to minimise, if not completely prevent, suicides in the world.


The World Health Organisation (WHO) claims that more lives are lost due to suicide than both war and homicide combined. 


More than 1 million people take their lives every year. One life is lost every 40 seconds due to suicide across the world and over 20 times this amount attempt to take their lives. 


Behind each of these grim statistics is a person who couldn’t find anything worthwhile to live for and have questioned the value of their own lives. 

 


Well-trained and dedicated volunteers work at ten befriending centres across the island. They are located in Kandy, Bandarawela, Panadura, Matale, Panduvasnuwara, Mawanella, Negombo, Kurunegala, Kohuwela and Jaffna.


 

 


These numbers speak of individual stories of loneliness, depression and hopelessness.


Such alarming statistics signal to one thing – prevention of suicide is an extremely important and urgent issue that needs to be addressed by society as a whole. 


It is the sense of belonging that comes from being a part of a community and a network of friends, family and caring individuals that helps abate the negative feeling that lead to suicide. In a world where ‘connection’ is obtained through electronic means via the internet and social media, the aspect and true connectivity with another human being is largely lost. 


As a society we are fast losing our ability to reach out to people and connect with them, which causes isolation and depression leading to suicide. It is only through communities, volunteer and other organisations, medical professionals all working in tandem that these bonds can be re-established. 

The participation of the community and society is integral in this fight to save lives and the theme for this year’s Suicide Prevention Day “Take a minute to change a life” encapsulates this.


The International Association for Suicide Prevention (IASP) the WHO, Befrienders’ World Wide (BW) and voluntary befriending organisations in about 70 countries in the world are engaged in making a big contribution towards preventing/minimising the incidence of suicide in the world.


In Sri Lanka for 43 long years Sri Lanka Sumithrayo, which is a Government-approved charity, and incorporated by an Act of Parliament No 10 of 1986, has been silently and unobtrusively providing the emotional support required by people, who are suicidal and despairing. 


Well-trained and dedicated volunteers work at ten befriending centres across the island. They are located in Kandy, Bandarawela, Panadura, Matale, Panduvasnuwara, Mawanella, Negombo, Kurunegala, Kohuwela and Jaffna.


The Rural outreach covers more than 110 villages in Panduvasnuwara, Lunugamvehera and Ambalantota every day of the week, 365 days of the year at no cost, to alleviate the misery, loneliness and despair of persons going through personal crises and or are in imminent danger of taking their own lives.


Many do not truly wish to take their own lives. It is often the ultimate expression of the hopelessness and the isolation felt. 


People think of suicide as a release or escape from the unbearable pain and agony they feel, and their inability to cope with the overwhelming emotional stress. 


Not having someone close enough to share their innermost feelings, perhaps due to shame or fear of being judged, feeling isolated and having none to turn to could make such an individual perceive death as the only option. 


Each one of these individuals who feel that way is a part of a family, a network of friends and a society. Therefore, the prevention of suicide is everyone’s responsibility


Each member of society has a role to play in the fight to prevent unnecessary deaths. It is as simple as individuals reaching out to those that maybe struggling and offering a kind word of support and a non-judgemental ear and the media reporting and televising suicide related matters in more sensitive and appropriate manner without making light of an individual’s feelings or circumstance. 


The minute you take to offer a gentle word of support or acknowledgement might make a difference between life and death.


“Take a minute-Change a life” Talking helps and listening heals. There’s help. Talk to Sri Lanka Sumithrayo in total confidence.
