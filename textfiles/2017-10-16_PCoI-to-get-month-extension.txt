PCoI to get 3-month extension?


	

It has been reported that the Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCOI) into the alleged irregularities that took place at the bond issue in February 2015 and March 2016 could be extended by a further three months after getting the permission of President, Maithripala Sirisena to do so.

This was as it was thought that more time was needed to complete the investigations into the case before a final report could be handed over to the President in this regard.

The Presidential Commission was appointed by the President last February for investigating the bonds issued between February 1 2015 and March 31 2016.(Manopriya Gunasekera and Ranjan Katugampola)
