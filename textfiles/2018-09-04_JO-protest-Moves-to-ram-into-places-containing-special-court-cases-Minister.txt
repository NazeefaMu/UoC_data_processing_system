Law and Order Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara said today that information has been received on possible ramming by the protesters into the places where important documents in connection with the special court cases have been preserved, during the tomorrow's Joint Opposition protest.

Addressing a press briefing Minister Madduma Bandara said that despite the Government having no intention to attack or obstruct any peaceful protests they have received information on possible attempts to create a chaotic situation in Colombo tomorrow.

Minister also said during the past three years no hurdles were placed on any joint opposition rally and the Government was not scared of tomorrow’s rally either.

Meanwhile Traffic DIG Ajith Rohana said that the Law enforcement authorities respect right to peaceful protests granted by the Constitution but will use the powers allowed by the Police ordinance and penal code to control any tense situation if occurred during the protest.

He requested those concerned to conduct the protest peacefully to avoid any inconvenience to the public. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
