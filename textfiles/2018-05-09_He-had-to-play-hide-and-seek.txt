He had to play hide and seek


	



 

Mariks of Kolonnawa was a guest at the opening of the Vesak Zone organized by his former workplace. Number One was the Chief Guest at the event. 

 


The ceremony over, Number One was about to get into his vehicle when he saw Mariks leaving the place. He immediately called him: “Mantrituma, hop in to go places with me!”


He got in not knowing where Number One was destined for. 


Mariks soon noticed that the vehicle turn towards the Temple Trees and he got panicky. “Sir, where are we going?”


“We are going to open the Vesak Zone at Temple Trees!”


Highly ruffled Mariks’ tone turned apologetic: “Given the problems we are having in the party these days, God knows what our Lokka will think about me when he sees me going about with you!”
“Don’t worry! You are accompanying me!” was Number One’s nonchalant reply. 


By now the vehicle pulled up opposite the Temple Trees and Number Two was approaching the vehicle to welcome the distinguished Chief Guest. 


Number One got out of the vehicle and walked on and soon the Big Two were exchanging greetings.
However, Mariks remained quietly inside the car until the duo stepped inside the building, they say.
