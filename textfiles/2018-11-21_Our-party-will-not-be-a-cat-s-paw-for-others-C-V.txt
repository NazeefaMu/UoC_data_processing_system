Our party will not be a cat's-paw for others-C.V.


	

Former Chief Minister of the Northern Provincial Council C.V. Wigneswaran maintained that the political party newly created by him was formed amidst various difficulties and the objective of the party is not to enter into an alliance with another party and play second fiddle to them.

The former CM expressed these views at a central committee of the newly formed TMK party held at a public reception hall at Kandamadam Junction in Jaffna.

He expressed this view in response to a question raised by a participant who wanted to know what the TMK’s stand was with regard to Opposition Leader R.Sampanthan’s proposal for all Tamil parties to get together at this crucial time.

He re-iterated that neither he nor his party would ever join hands with the Tamil National Alliance for any reason nor contest an election under their symbol and that this decision was taken by him some time back when they organised a series of events to help Tamils of the North to rise up.

However, he said the TNA had shown that it was envious of anything undertaken by him for the benefit of the Tamil people and they had even worked to remove him from the Chief Minister's post as a result. He said this clearly showed how ungrateful the TNA leaders were towards him after all that he had done during his tenure as Chief Minister.

He promised to make the TMK the foremost party in the North which works diligently for the sake of the people who have been fooled by the TNA that has taken them for granted. (Romesh Madushanka)
