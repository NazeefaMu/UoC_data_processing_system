CBK created rifts in SLFP - Dullas

 
SLFP Vice President and Parliamentarian Dullus Alahapperuma yesterday said former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga created rifts in the Sri Lanka Freedom Party.
"She broke away from the party formed by her father," he said.
Dullas Alahapperuma added that former President Bandaranaike divided the SLFP on a number of occasions and her alleged involved in corruption and malpractices have been vividly described by journalist Victor Ivan in his book Chaura Rajina.
"If former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga continues to destroy the party, I will take a decision with regard to my party membership soon," he said
