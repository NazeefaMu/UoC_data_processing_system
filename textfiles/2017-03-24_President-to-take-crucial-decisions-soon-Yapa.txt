President Maithripala Sirisena is to take several crucial politically and economically important decisions over the next few weeks, State Minister of Finance Lakshman Yapa Abeywardane revealed yesterday.

“During the past two years, President Sirisena patiently maintained a democratic stance on all issues, but in the remaining four years he intends to fulfil the responsibilities he undertook,” Minster Abeywardane told a media conference at the Finance Ministry, in Colombo.

“Some of these decisions would be bitter for some and good for others,” he claimed.

According to the minister, the main purpose of taking these decisions would be to create a stable government, ensure political stability in the country and as well as the Sri Lanka Freedom Party. “There were things that happened during last two years, that can be described as satisfactory and some not,” the Minister said.

In response to a question, why the President took so long to take such crucial decisions, the Minister said, “When a head of state takes decisions he has to consider various aspects, including his own stability.”

He said now the people of the country are of the opinion that it is the right time to make changes on some crucial issues. (Diana Udayangani)
