The Galle International Cricket Stadium would not be removed but only an unauthorized pavilion at the stadium would be removed, Southern Development Minister Sagala Ratnayake said in Parliament today.

He assured that the Galle Stadium would be used for both national and international matches.

“Another cricket stadium will also be constructed in the Galle District,” the Minister tweeted later.
