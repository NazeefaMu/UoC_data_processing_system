All-powerful deity is the real owner of the devalaya tusker
	

The Wildlife authorities these days are out on a relentless search for elephants held in captivity illegally.

A team of Wildlife officials reinforced by a security escort the other day visited the precincts of a Devalaya in Ruhuna looking for an elephant reportedly held in illegal custody there. This devalaya visited by thousands of devotees annually is dedicated to a highly venerated deity believed to be commanding unusual powers.
The Nilame and Kapuralas of the devalaya who met the Wildlife officials admitted that they were having in their custody an elephant offered to the all-powerful deity of the devalaya by the previous government. Therefore, the tusker really belongs to the Deviyanvahanse and He is the real custodian of the animal. And we have listed it in an inventory of the possessions of the Deviyanvahanse, they told the Wildlife officials.
The Nilame, the Chief Custodian of the Devalaya added: You may take away the elephant if that is your wish or decision. But, we have to let you know that we have to report to the Deviyanvahanse that you have taken away the animal.
The Wildlife officials taken aback by this new development held a brief council in haste and decided to appraise the higher authorities of the situation and move in the matter after getting fresh instructions.
The Nilame again addressed the Wildlife officials who were about to leave. You, gentlemen here are on official duty and we dont propose to obstruct your duty in any way. But I wish to ask you to think of the dire consequences that could befall you all if you dare take away something that belongs to the Deviyanvahanse.

## Title: Amana Takaful launches first ever Shariah compliant retirement plan

Amana Takaful launches first ever Shariah compliant retirement plan
	
Amana Takaful Life (ATL Life) recently launched another innovative life insurance product by introducing the first ever Shariah compliant retirement plan  DeergaYou .
This breakthrough product caters to the growing demand for a pension plan that secures the financial security of customers in their golden years. DeergaYou paves the way for one to save regularly between the ages of 18 to 55 and thereafter benefit from an increasing monthly pension payment. The main aim of the product is to enable a dignified and financially independent retirement for its participants.
Commenting on this Reyaz Jeffrey  CEO of ATL Life stated, Even though talking about retirement is sometimes stigmatised in this country, its important that people plan early for their retirement.
Retirement is not a bad thing nor is it a word which is taboo - If you want to live comfortably, you need to make wise investment decisions now, when you are earning and have the capacity to save.
Generally, we are comfortable with our EPF/ETF savings, but we dont realise that this is not enough, because our lifestyles are constantly changing and the cost of living is on the rise. DeergaYou is an affordable and practical retirement plan provided by ATL Life and this is the only Shariah compliant retirement plan available in the market. One of the key pillars of our business model is that all of our investments comply with high ethical standards, so our customers can rest assured that their retirement funds are in safe and trusted hands.
DeergaYou as a retirement plan boasts a host of features that provide customers with added convenience and peace of mind. The structure of the plan ensures that customers can easily access funds at their time of need, and benefit from regular pension pay-outs. Additionally, the strong backing of ATL Life gives customers an added sense of security.
After a DeergaYou policy holder completes the selected period of contribution which is typically between 15-30 years, they will be able to immediately access regular pension pay-outs. Additionally, 110 percent of the contribution will be paid in the unfortunate event of the policyholders demise, we will also pay a policyholder if he or she develops a permanent physical disability or diagnosed with a critical illness during the policy period. In keeping with Takaful principles, each customer will have an Investment Account with contributions being credited to the same. The fund will continue to accumulate with regular contributions and investment income will be credited to the participant.
Importantly, all funds are transparent to participants and their values can be monitored 24x7 via ATLs Mobile App and WEB PORTAL.
Post the accumulation period, the pension pay-out commences and will increase annually, providing a safe edge against inflation.
If an individual invests Rs. 5000 on a monthly basis for 20 years, he or she can be assured of a starting monthly pension of around Rs. 22,000 which will increase up to Rs. 40,000- by the end of a 15-year pension term. The plan also comes with a choice of two varying funds, enabling the policyholder to invest based on their individual requirements, stated Althaf Kaleel, Manager  Wealth Management, ATL Life. 
Due to increasingly higher standards of healthcare and a greater awareness of the importance of healthy living, life expectancy in the country has increased. With most people expected to live well into their 70s, they must be prepared to face the challenge of sustaining themselves during this period, and will have to make allocations for the cost of medication, food and other activities. Whilst a limited number of government sector employees will enjoy a pension, private sector employees rely on EPF/ETF, which are insufficient. A private pension therefore has become more of a necessity than a comfort factor. A pension will ensure that retirees are not a burden on their families and are able to meet their own expenses, whilst enjoying a wholesome life with their grandchildren, friends and extended family.
Most developed countries see retirement as an enabler, a time when people can do the things that they sacrificed when they were raising a family, like travelling, enjoying a holidayor going on apilgrimage etc. Sri Lanka in its quest to reach its target of US$ 5000 per capita income is certainly headed in the right direction. To ensure that people enjoy greater financial freedom in their retirement and attain a high standard of living, it is important that they start a pension fund, as early on as possible, added Jeffrey.

As the maximum temperature had been exceeded by 2-3 Celsius points in most parts of the island, the Meteorological Department has issued a notice requesting the public to refrain from exerting themselves in broad daylight.
With the heat rising with exertion of the body, the present climatic condition does not provide the opportunity to reduce such body heat. Therefore, it is advisable to refrain from exerting in broad daylight, it said.
The Department says that the absence of inter-monsoon rains and the change of wind patterns had affected the environment to experience immense heat these days. (Diana Udayangani)

Security at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) had been increased by 200 per cent to prevent a possible terrorist attack, Defense Secretary Karunasena Hettiarachchi said today.
Addressing a press briefing, he assured that security that was presently in place at the airport was beefed up following the terror attacks that occurred at the Brussels Airport in Belgium on Tuesday.
According to intelligence sources, phone calls had been made to several institutions including the airport. Relevant investigations were continuing to ascertain the veracity of these calls as well as where they originated from, he said.
It should be mentioned that on December 29 last year President Maithripala Sirisena instructed the intelligence authorities to tighten the security at the airport and other locations considered to be National landmarks which could be targets for terrorist attacks.
Discussions were held with the participation of the Air Force, Airport Services, SriLankan Airlines, Immigration and Emigration Department, Civil Air Services Authority and the Sri Lanka Customs about what precautionary methods could be taken to prevent terror attacks, Mr. Hettiarachchi said.
Now the precautionary methods are being implemented. The Defense Ministry reviews the progress of the security measures at the airport and other locations considered to be probable targets so that any shortcomings, if any exist, could be swiftly dealt with, he said.
Speaking to the Daily Mirror, the Airport Duty Manager said safety precautions were in place to prevent a terror attack on the airport.
There is extra vigilance being paid to those who enter the country and those in transit, the Defense Secretary said.(Chaturanga Pradeep)

Disreputable duo were his undoing
	

This Betel leaf one hailing from Sabaragamuwa is a senior purohita, who, nevertheless, remains a die-hard loyalist of the former boss.

In a situation where he had no other choice, he accepted office to work under yahapalanaya, they say.
However, ever since becoming a purohita, party supporters from his constituency have been criticizing him for accepting a portfolio which does not enable him to either help them individually or do some work for their common good. When he was a purohita under the previous regime, his constituents had turned up at his office on the Public Day in their hundreds, but, nowadays, the number attending his Public Day can be counted on the fingers of the two hands, they say.
The unhappy purohita had at length opened up his heart to a select group of colleagues in yahapalanaya recently.
The former boss is okay and it was the two disreputable members of his family who were his undoing. If the duo were given the short shrift, we could unhesitatingly throw in our lot with the former boss once again, he had confided in them.

A loquacious purohita from the hills who arrived at the Asgiriya Rajamaha Viharaya to pay his last respects to the Maha Nayake who passed away recently was about to enter the temple premises when he casually inquired from a bystander who were the VIPs already inside the temple. The bystander replied that the former Loku Mahattaya was the only VIP present inside at the time.

This unexpected reply brought the purohita to a sudden halt in his tracks. If I meet him, I am sure to get a shelling from him. Let us rush back to our vehicles, he told his escorts as he quickly turned back on his heels.
As he got into his limousine, the purohita told his driver: There is a big rush at the temple. Let us go to the cremation grounds.
The vehicle carrying the purohita then flew towards the Asgiriya esplanade.

India-SL to upgrade Jaffna airport without acquiring more land
	
India and Sri Lanka have agreed that the Jaffna airport in North Sri Lanka should be upgraded to be an international airport without extending the runway because fresh land acquisition is being opposed by the local people.
A five-member technical team of the Airports Authority of India (AAI) Chennai which inspected the airport recently, concluded that it could be upgraded without acquiring more land, the Indian Consul General in Jaffna, A.Natarajan, told Express on Tuesday.
Normally, airports are built with future traffic and bigger aircraft in mind, but if something has to be done quickly in Jaffna without raking up a controversy over land acquisition, upgrading the facilities without extending the runway is the best option, another Indian official said.
According to Natarajan an upgraded airport may become operational in a year.
The people of the area have been fearing that agricultural land which ought to be returned to them by the Lankan military after the war, may be acquired for the expansion of the airport. Northern Province Chief Minister C.V.Wigneswaran had also said that any improvements to the airport will have to be done without depriving the people of their lands.
Jaffna airport now has a runway of 2.3 kilometers which is said to be enough to take narrow body jet passenger aircraft like Boeing 717 which can carry 100 passengers.

Lankan refugees family released
	
In a late-evening development on Tuesday, the State government ordered the release of Sri Lankan Tamil refugee K. Dhayabararajs family from the special quarantine detention camp at Mandapam in Ramanathapuram district. As the indefinite fast of the family demanding release entered the sixth day, the authorities released Udayakala and her three children amid allegations that their detention was unlawful, police sources said.
Mr. Dhayabararaj, who is held at the Tiruchi special camp, had alleged that his family was being illegally detained in the special quarantine camp that lacked basic amenities. He claimed that the health condition of his wife who required an emergency surgery was declining. Since no dole (financial aid of Rs. 100 per day) was paid, his family had to starve for several days. On Thursday, they decided to launch a fast-unto-death agitation demanding justice.
On release, a local church pastor agreed to give them food and shelter. My wife is in a state of shockshe was under treatment for depression for sometime. The authorities have to explain why my family was detained in the quarantine camp for so long without any assistance, Mr. Dhayabararaj told The Hindu on Tuesday.
He said the family was arrested on arrival by boat in 2014. After being convicted in the Passport Act case, the family served a one year sentence. We were detained again in special camps. I was separated from my wife and children and lodged at the Tiruchi special camp. There is no case against us. In the last six months, I sent several petitions to the Home Secretary seeking my release but there was no response, he said.
Police sources maintained that the process was on to repatriate Dhayabararaj and his family to Sri Lanka. We have information that he is involved in a financial fraud case in Sri Lanka. During the process of repatriation, it is required to keep him custody. There is a possibility that he might abscond if released, a senior police official said on condition of anonymity.
Peoples Union for Civil Liberties national general secretary V. Suresh said the Tamil Nadu government should respond with a humanitarian gesture and release Dhayabararaj from the special camp. Instead of sticking to technicalities, they must release him. His wife and children need him as much as he needs them for their collective well being, he said. (The Hindu)

Leak in two pipelines of Victoria power plant
	
A leak has been reported in two of the three main pipelines carrying water to the Victoria hydro power plant turbines, officials said today.
A senior official said they believed that the pipe had sprung a leak because of the intense heat prevailing during the day. He said this was a normal occurrence during hot weather season.
We believe that this leak was the result of the intense heat expanding the pipelines. Theres no need for quick repairs because this condition will gradually ease with night fall, he said.
The official said the leak was minute and would in no way effect the hydro power generation.
When Daily Mirror contacted another official at the power plant, he said the leak was due to a repair carried out recently at the hydro power plant. He also said it was impossible to have any sort of leak as there was a shortage of water at this time.
The amount of water in the dam has also dropped by 45% to 50%, the official said. (Kalathma Jayawardhane and Nadeeka Dayabandara)

Mahela urges radical restructuring
	
With Sri Lankas hopes for a semi-final spot hanging on a thread with two-must win games remaining against high-riding England and South Africa in the Group 1, former Sri Lanka batting great Mahela Jayawardena urged Sri Lanka Cricket authorities to introduce a radical restructuring of the game at domestic level to bridge the ever-widening gap between the domestic standard and international standard.
The national team has struggled to cope with the retirement of several of their high-profile cricketers during the last two-years-- including Jayawardene and Kumar Sangakkara and many have called for the restructuring of the cricket set up to meet the demands.
Speaking during a live show in Sri Lankas seven-wicket loss to the West Indies on Sunday Jayawardena also said that Sri Lanka had no excuses for the poor performance since they had two years to prepare for the tournament.
I dont like to call it a transitioned phase. I think having a major tournament like this, we had time to plan. But obviously there were things which did not go right. Its something Sri Lanka Cricket should sit back and look at. It happens. All the teams go through that. We need to look to how we could develop our next generation of cricketers much quicker. Is there something we can do in our domestic structure to develop them faster and push them faster Jayawardena said responding to a question posted on twitter on the sideline of Sri Lankas disappointing performance against the West Indies.
 So there are areas to look at and push players. We still have the talent. Majority of the players who were there when we won the World Twenty20 is with the team ( I think around 6-8 players) they had to fill in the other places. So we absolutely look at it very seriously, he added.
Jayawardena has repeatedly urged cricket authorities to overhaul the domestic game and masterminded a city based Elite Cricket Tournament comprising five teams which will feature the best players in the trade but faced a natural death after the election of the new cricket administration headed by Thilanga Sumathipala.
The zonal-based tournament which the interim committee of Sidath Wettimuni planned to introduce this year was suspended but SLC chief Thilanga Sumathipala had said that a county standard inter-provincial tournament was on the cards to replace the disbanded Zonal tournament while safe-guarding the age-old club system.
Jayawardena is closely following the national team currently competing in Group 1 of the World Twenty20 tournament played across eight venues in India offering expert commentary on his Sri Lanka matches.
Meanwhile Sri Lanka cricketers on Monday night landed here in New Delhi ahead of their final two group matches against England and South Africa. Sri Lanka takes on high-riding England on March 26 and South Africa on March 28 in search of a semi-final spot. With West Indies almost assured of a semi-final spot following their two impressive wins against England and Sri Lanka, it is a three cornered battle between Sri Lanka, England and South Africa for the other remaining semi-final spot from Group 1.
The defending champions need to win both their matches to go through to the next round, a tough ask from the islanders given their disappointing performance in batting and fielding. We are having an optional training session today and two mandatory ones on next two days ahead of Saturdays match, team manager Jerome Jayaratne said. (Champika Fernando reporting from Delhi)

The joint opposition said today former president Mahinda Rajapaksas life is in danger and the government must take responsibility if anything untoward happened to him.
SLFP MP Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena said the government had neither allocated a cent to the repairing of Mr. Rajapaksas bullet-proof vehicle that met with an accident several months ago nor had he be allocated an official residence even after 14 months.
It is the joint opposition that is carrying out the duties of the opposition. We have had to face lot of threats and intimidation.Mr. Rajapaksa, who represents the joint opposition, has serious issues with regard to his security. We have firsthand experience where Gamini Dissnayake and Lalith Athulathmudali, who led the Democratic United National Front against the then government, were killed. So we have a reasonable fear about Mr. Rajapaksas life as well, he said.
Mr. Abeywardena told a news conference that Mr. Rajapaksas security concerns had aggravated after former LTTE leaders were released and with underworld gangsters freely operating in the country.
This government has shown its inability to rule this country. So it is trying to suppress the people and we are the only group preventing the government from doing so, he said. (Ajith Siriwardana)

Overworked flight crew behind Flydubai crash
	
An accident involving a Flydubai plane was inevitable, a former Flydubai captain told RT on condition of anonymity.
He revealed that pilots are forced to work while exhausted, while saying he had been worked to death despite complaints.
Speaking to RT in Doha, the former pilot said Flydubais top management was aware of the issue, but had done nothing to resolve it. When I was still at the company, one of the last things I told management is that there would be an accident because of pilot fatigue, he said.
The reason for fatigue is simple  pilots are being repeatedly overworked and not given enough time to sleep between flights.
The whistleblower provided documents showing that pilots, junior pilots in particular, are being assigned multiple flight shifts in a row. He argued that the crew often does not have enough time for sleep readjustment.
"Everybody at the company has these dangerous shifts from day flight to night flight, and then back to a day flight, and then back to a night flight, and it has definitely been a big issue for a long time.
The former captain added he was sure that sleep deprivation had contributed to the Flydubai flight FZ981 crash in the southern Russian city of Rostov-on-Don, which killed all 62 passengers and crew on board. (Russia Today)

They went for blessings and got an earful
	

Several senior purohitas in yahapalanaya the other day called on the chief monk of a well-known Buddhist temple situated close to the hill capital.

This prelate known for his straight talk residing in this temple once bounded by a barbed wire fence, addressed in a stern tone the purohitas who sat down after paying him obeisance in the traditional way: Look here, gentlemen. Have you no shame You misled that man to his endDo you want to destroy the new man too You people keep on blaming the former set and have failed to do anything worthwhile
The purohitas uttered respectfully, EhemaiEhemai and ventured no reply. Later they had quietly faded from the scene after declining an invitation to tea by the monk.
One of the purohitas who came under fire from the prelate was a big mouth from the hills who made it to the council from the list. Another one was a bigwig from Uva who lost his seat thrice in a row, but back in Diyawanna thanks to the preference vote. The other two were prominent ones from the West and the central hills respectively.

Weaknesses of the electricity lines caused blackout: Minister
	
Weaknesses of the electricity lines have been the cause of the recent countrywide blackout, Power and Renewable Energy Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya informed Parliament today.
In a special statement he said, "A transformer at Biyagama transmission station had tripped at 2.20 pm resulting the breakdown of the Norochcholai Power Plant which generates 900 Mw of electricity. The remaining transmission lines had not had the capacity to transmit this load. All power stations had been disconnected from the system as a security measure," the minister said while admitting that this was an unusual situation.
He said it had taken eight hours for the engineers to rectify the situation.
The minister said the prevailing drought had an impact as well because hydro power could not be generated with water having to be preserved. This situation resulted in the Ceylon Electricity Board having to go for a staggered power interruption exercise.
The minister said a similar situation had occurred in 2009 with power outages five years later. He said power had been disrupted three times within six months since 2014. However, he said several steps have been taken to prevent similar incidents in the future as there was no plausible technical explanation.
These, he said included the provision of army protection to all important power stations and transmission stations and obtaining assistance from the experts from the German company which had manufactured the transformers.
The minister said the improper design of the Norochcholai power plant and weaknesses in the transmission stations had also identified as key challenges in the power sector.
He said a special committee had been appointed to look into the maintenance of important power plants and transmission centres as a short term measure while private power stations including ACE Power at Embilipitiya, Heladanavi and ACE Power at Matara would be purchased by the government.
The construction of new power stations including that of Uma Oya will be expedited as a long term measure (Yohan Perera)
