She has done it again!


	



 

This lady occupying the main chair in a city council had been in the news in the recent past for taking a series of arbitrary decisions. She has now triggered a new controversy by assigning an office room in the council premises to an ordinary member of her party, they say.

 


The legal division of the city administration had pointed out it was illegal to allot an office room in the council complex to an ordinary member, but the main chair had waved off the objection with disdain.


The room now given to the party member had originally been set apart for the media personnel, council sources say.
