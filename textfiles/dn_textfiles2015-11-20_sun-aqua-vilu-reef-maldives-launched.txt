Sun Aqua Vilu Reef Maldives launched

Sun Aqua brand opened its second property, the Sun Aqua Vilu Reef, a refurbished resort in Meedhuffushi Island in the heart of the South Nilandhe Atoll.
The property is the second addition to the group after the Sun Aqua Pasikudah which opened earlier in 2015 on Sri Lanka's North East coast.
Originally opened in 1998 Vilu Reef is proud to take on new colours and sit as the flagship Maldivian property for the Sun Aqua brand which plans to continue its international growth over the coming years. Guests can enjoy relaxing experiences led by simple luxuries, sensational food, warm, dedicated service and as it stayed open to guests during its refurbishment it continues to welcome new and repeat guests that have grown to love the property and island, year after year.
On October 28, the property officially re-launched to a fanfare of celebration with official ceremonies followed by a beach side feast, dancing and live music held throughout the evening. The Sun Aqua Vilu Reef is easily accessible from Malè and the International Airport via a 40 minute seaplane ride. The Sun Siyam Family Lounge at the seaplane terminal bids an immediate start to the holiday offering refreshments and massages to help settle guests into the Sun Aqua spirit. The property has gone through a complete revival and been refurbished to an extremely high standard creating five different categories of rooms including 15 NEW Sun Aqua Pool Villas. Splashes of colour can be found throughout the property impressing the Sun Aqua brand into the new future of Vilu Reef.
There are 62 shell shaped bungalows, (14 Beach Villas, 18 Deluxe Beach Villas and 10 Jacuzzi Deluxe Beach Villas, 5 Deluxe Beach Villas with Pool and 15 Sun Aqua Pool Villas) some now with lava-stone pools and whirlpool bathtubs. Rooms are now all 20% larger than before and offer private sundecks, re-fitted bathrooms and day swing beds.
A further 41 Water Villas (20 Reef Villas, 9 Sunset Reef Villas, 6 Aqua Villas with plunge pools, 5 Aqua Suites with private swimming pools and a Grand Reef Suite) complete the accommodation offering with a select few even hiding inviting over-water hammocks.
