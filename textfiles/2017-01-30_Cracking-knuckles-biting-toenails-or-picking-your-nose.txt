 UK, (Daily Mail, London), 28 January 2017-  Finishing other people’s sentences, cracking your knuckles and biting your toenails all feature in a chart of Britons’ worst habits.  


More than 90 per cent admit to having at least one bad habit, with one in 10 admitting to 10 or more weaknesses.  


Swearing was the most common bad trait, followed by nose-picking, not listening when others are speaking and biting your nails.But more immediately, something as seemingly insignificant as not washing your hands or biting your nails often can lead to a cold or bug, or even pass your germs on to an unsuspecting stranger or loved one.’
