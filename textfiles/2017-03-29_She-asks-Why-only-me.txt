A dainty Diyawanna member from the South currently facing a legal hiccup that could cost her seat in the council had found herself in position of a drowning person eager to clutch at a straw. 

 


Meanwhile, some yahapalanaya elements in a bid to take advantage of her plight had promised her a deputy office in addition to helping her out of the present predicament if she quit the JO camp.


The dainty one had later revealed this offer to her colleagues at a JO powwow. Reacting to this revelation, the former strongman had said after a loud guffaw: “People from the South would never resort to that kind of treachery.”


However, the fair one who saw no humor in the situation had lamented: “There are others in the council having the Swiss citizenship.  But they are gunning only for us.”
