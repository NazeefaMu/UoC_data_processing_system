Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) General Secretary MP Udaya Gammanpila today claimed that there was a move by the Police Special Investigation Unit (SIU) to arrest him based on unfounded allegations of preparing fraudulent documents in form of Power of Attorney.
He said a reliable source at the Police had informed him that the SIU was framing a charge to arrest him and charged a key minister in the government was influencing Police action against him.
“The SIU is investigating on a claim that I have sold shares of an Australian company amounting to Rs 110 million using a fraudulent Power of Attorney. I vehemently condemn these allegations,” he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
