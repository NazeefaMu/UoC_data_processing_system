culpture is the art of making two or three dimensional representative or abstract forms, especially by carving stone or wood, or by casting metal or plaster. The designs may be embodied in freestanding objects, reliefs on surfaces or in environments. Although ‘sculpture’ is a household name in Sri Lanka, the terms ‘digital sculpture’ seem alien. It is a widespread form of art used to create movies and cartoons. 
Against this backdrop, it is noteworthy that Sri Lankan digital sculptor, Waruna Sanjaya Weligamage (31) has contributed immensely to the industry. He is currently working as a freelance digital sculptor at Quantum Mechanix (QMx) in California, USA. He is also the Managing Director of Man Cave Toys (Pvt) Limited. 

Career 

Speaking to Daily Mirror, Mr. Weligamage said he had worked as a salesman for a leading corporation in Sri Lanka for over 10 years. 
“I started self-learning 3D software in 2014. I studied all stages of production (concept, modelling, rigging, animation and composing). After two years of extensive learning, I started my career as a freelance custom sculptor for international collector’s communities doing likeness portrait sculpts and have designed over 50 major movie characters so far,” he said. Mr. Weligamage has also been designing props and accessories to match each of those movie characters.   



Achievements

Within a short spell, Mr. Weligamage was able to master the art of digital sculpturing. With his experience and industrial expertise, he formed a local company, Man Cave Toys (Pvt) Limited in 2016, to create customized sculptures of action figures and props. He also maintains a high-resolution lab which provides 3D prints. He has designed main characters for famous international blockbuster movies.   
Mr. Weligamage is the first Sri Lankan to showcase a 3D artwork at ‘San Diego Comic Con 2017’ in USA, as Quantum Mechanix (QMx) released ‘Pennywise,’ the dancing clown figure in American supernatural horror film ‘It.’ The movie directed by Andy Muschietti is based on the 1986 novel of the same name by Stephen King. ‘It’ is the highest-grossing horror film and fourth highest-grossing r-rated film of all times.  

Success story 

Mr. Weligamage says his main interest of work is designing realistic human models and that he is conversant with the digital sculpting tool ‘ZBrush.’   
“Sculpting has always been my passion and as an artist I am committed to work for any number of hours until the client is satisfied with the outcome of the undertaken project,” he said.
