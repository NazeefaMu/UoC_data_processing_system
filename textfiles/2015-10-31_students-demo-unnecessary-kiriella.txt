The demonstration by students of the Higher National Diploma in Accountancy (HNDA) outside the University Grants Commission (UGC) was absolutely unnecessary because the government had already decided to award degree status to the diploma, Universities and Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella said yesterday.
He told Daily Mirror that he met the student unions on Thursday morning and assured them that the course would have its degree status restored.
“We have advised the relevant institutions to restore the degree status which was removed by the previous regime" the minister said and added that he would shortly issue a media statement giving all the details.
Several students were injured while some were arrested in the aftermath of clash between the police and the students during Thursday's protest.(Yohan Perera)
