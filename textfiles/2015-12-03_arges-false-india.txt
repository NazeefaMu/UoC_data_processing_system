An investigation into allegations of demand for sexual favours by officials of Sri Lanka Red Cross (SLRC) from the beneficiaries of India-funded houses in the Tamil-dominated Northern Province found that the charges were false and baseless, Indian Minister of State for External Affairs V. K. Singh has said.
Rajya Sabha was informed about findings of the joint probe by Indian Consulate General in Jaffna, SLRC and International Federation of Red Cross (IFRC), Zee news said.
"The report concluded that the allegation of sexual harassment made by the complainant was false and baseless. The report concluded that a few disgruntled employees of SLRC had fabricated the allegations to malign the reputation of SLRC," said Minister Singh while replying to a question.
The probe panel had concluded its investigation in October.
Singh said the report was handed over to Sri Lanka's Ministry of Law and Order and Prison Reforms by IFRC and SLRC.
India had offered to build 50,000 houses in the war- ravaged northern province of Sri Lanka and construction of more than 39,500 of them have been completed.
