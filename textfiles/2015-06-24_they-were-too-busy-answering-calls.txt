They were too busy answering calls!


	


	
	The black-coated gentry allied to the Betel leaf party gathered recently to express their support for the deposed strongman.  Among the participants were a number of black coats now holding ministerial offices at various levels?

The secretarial one of the Betel Leaf party was in the chair.
With the deliberations over, a motion calling for the nomination of the deposed strongman as the prime ministerial candidate of the party was proposed and seconded.
The chair called on those in favour of the motion to raise their hands.   Two black coats from the audience immediately got up with their mobiles held against the ear and walked out apparently seeking privacy to answer the calls. One of them was a politico from Wayamba who once held a Chief Ministerial office and the other was a sage who entered Diyawanna from Sabaragamuwa. All black coats appeared highly amused. And some of them tittered while some others guffawed. The duo who walked out never returned!
