Parliament approves Civil Society representatives for CC

 
Parliament yesterday gave its approval for the appointments of Dr. A.T. Ariyaratne, Shibly Aziz, PC and Dr. Radhika Coomaraswamy as Civil Society representatives for the Constitutional Council (CC).
Leader of the House Minister Lakshman Kiriella moved the motion on behalf of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe seeking the approval of the House. The House agreed unanimously.
Meanwhile, MEP Leader Dinesh Gunawardene raising a Point of Order demanded to know as to how two Cabinet Ministers have been appointed in the 10 member Constitutional Council.
He further said that when the 19th Amendment was brought before Parliament for its passing, it was promised that the council would not include the members of the Cabinet to maintain its independence from the Executive. Now with appointment of two members of the Cabinet, that policy has been changed, the Government should explain as to how it changed from its previous position.
Leader of the House Lakshman Kiriella: “There is no such thing in the Act. What matters here is the provisions of the Act.
MP Dinesh Gunawardene: The Prime Minister promised to that effect.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya: This matter could be discussed later. Today, the names of civil members are being proposed for the approval not the other members.
Meanwhile, the CC met in the Parliament Complex yesterday with President Maithripala Sirisena presiding.
