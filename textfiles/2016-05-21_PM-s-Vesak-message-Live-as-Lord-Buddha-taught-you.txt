PM’s Vesak message: Live as Lord Buddha taught you


	

As we celebrate the thrice blessed Wesak once again, we are reminded of the true values Lord Buddha enshrined – Metta, Muditha, Karuna and Upekkha- which must be the ideals that are upheld in a sincere spiritual awakening towards building social goodwill and harmony.

Vesak is not only the most sacred day to all Buddhists, but it also signifies a greater message of love and compassion for mankind; it places a responsibility on Buddhists to lead lives that are truly in line with the teachings of Lord Buddha. Let us strive to right the wrongs, substitute positivity for negativity, replace anger with compassion, meet hatred with love, overtake evil with good and replace lies with the truth.

This Wesak, as always, let us bring our lives in line with the sublime message of the Dhamma ; let us re-dedicate ourselves towards experiencing a fresh sense of spiritual guidance towards the right path of enlightenment, engaging in a spirit of sharing and compassionate co-existence.

Our Government has taken an initiative concerning the greater upliftment of the Buddha Sasana and The Sangha Society while ensuring the well being of the people, towards a goal of building and sustaining a just and compassionate society.
