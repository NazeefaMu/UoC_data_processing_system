The sacred term, joint opposition must not be used to identify a gang of rogues, I will form a joint opposition so as to perform the duties of an actual opposition, former minister Mervyn Silva told a media briefing today.
He said in the past everything took place according to the whims and fancies of the Rajapaksas and he had to act on their behalf on several occasions. Mr. Silva said that from today he would act as the convener of the joint opposition and in the very near future there would be many who would join him.

MR not invited for Victory Day ceremonies
	
Former president Mahinda Rajapaksa has not been invited to participate in the Victory Day ceremonies being held on May 18, Defence Secretary Karunasena Hettiarachchi said today.
The seventh war victory celebration, Sanhindiyawe Piya Satahan is scheduled to be held at the War Memorial in Battaramulla under the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena. The event is to be followed by a cultural show at the Independence Square in Colombo.
Mr. Hettiarachchi told a news briefing held at the Government Information Department that Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, Commanders of the three armed forces, parliamentarians, war heroes, the Police, the Civil Defense Forces and war heroes' family members will participate.
Government parliamentarians were billed to participate while neither the former president nor his supporters invited. The public have been invited to the cultural show.
Meanwhile, when asked whether another War Victory Day was being organized in Kurunegala at which the former president and his supporters would participate, Mr. Hettiarachi said that he had also heard about the rumour.
None of the military personnel have been given permission to attend any such event, he said.
The Government had decided not to hold a military parade because it was too costly to do so. (Darshana Sanjeewa)

MR security- Remaining army personal removed
	
National Freedom Front (NFF) Leader Wimal Weerawansa said the last batch of army personnel attached to former President Mahinda Rajapaksa's security detail had been asked to report to the Army Headquarters.
He said this was a sign that the government feared Mr. Rajapaksa
"This also proves that the government has affected by the Mahinda Rajapaksa Phobia when considering the fact that all army personnel have been removed from Mr. Rajapaksas security detail," he said.
Mr. Weerawansa told a media briefing that the report on the government deploying the Special Task Forces (STF) personnel for Mr. Rajapaksa's security was a lie.
Instead of STF security, the government has assigned personnel from the Ministerial Security Division for Mr. Rajapaksa. This move will prove dangerous. By pulling out the remaining army personnel, the government may be attempting to place Mr. Rajapaksas life in danger, he added.
Mr. Weerawansa said the government might have thought it was the best time to withdraw the remaining army personnel because of the current weather conditions and the upcoming Vesak celebrations.
It is a despicable act to take such a step. There should not be any political influence when it comes to a national crisis, he said and added that NFF decried this attempt to put Mr. Rajapaksas life in danger. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

The Elections Commissioner, Colombo District Returning Offer, the Attorney General and 22 others were cited by her as respondents.
The petitioner said the votes she had polled at some of the polling divisions and the votes secured by some of the other candidates had been arbitrarily, illegally and unlawfully altered by the election officials when entering them into the computer system.

Ms. Senanayake said she was unaware of the irregularities taking place in the computer room and as such was unable to exercise her rights as a candidate to request a re-count of the preference votes.(SS Selvanayagam)

We need Gota-like officials: Gammanpila
	
The service of officials like former defence secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa is felt all the more at this time when the city has been hit by flash floods causing many hindrance to the people, Pivthuru Hela Urumaya (JHU) General Secretary MP Udaya Gammanpila today said.
Addressing a news conference, he said the Gotabaya Rajapaksa era was the golden era of urban development without argument. This is a fact everyone accepts in unison, he said.
He said Mr. Rajapaksa put an end to the practices of sticking posters on walls, putting banners on lamp posts and dumping garbage on roadsides and to canals.
He also removed hawkers from pavements and stopped reclamation of lowlands. But today, garbage dumps are everywhere. Canals are blocked by garbage resulting in flash floods. No proper garbage disposal management is available today, Mr. Gammanpila said.
He said there are skilful officials in the Urban Development Authority (UDA) who are capable of keeping the city alive, but they have been isolated after labelling as Gotas people.
For the first time in six years, the road to Parliament had been flooded. We request Megapolis and Western Development Minister to look into these issues and to give back Beautiful Colombo to the people instead of going for bigger plans, he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
