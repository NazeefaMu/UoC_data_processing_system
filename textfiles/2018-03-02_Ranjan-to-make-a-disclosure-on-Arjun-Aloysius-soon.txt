Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake yesterday said he would make a disclosure with regard to the Perpetual Treasuries Chief Arjun Aloysius soon.

Mr Ramanayake also said that he would disclose the names of politicians, religious leaders and media personnel, who had obtained funds from the Perpetual Treasuries Chief Arjun Aloysius in a few days.

The Deputy Minister said there were MPs who had obtained money from Aloysius from both the Government and the Opposition.

“There are also women MPs, who had got money from Mendis Distilleries and, Buddhist and Christian religious leaders. I will reveal their names as well,” he said while highlighting that more than 157 cheque counter slips had been recovered.

He said those who want the Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to bring former Governor of Central Bank Arjun Mahendran when he returned from his Singapore tour, should send Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa to bring his brother-in-law Udayanga Weeratunga from wherever he stayed.

“Both Mr Wickremesinghe and Rajapaksa would be rated as good leaders if they help find the two, who are wanted,” he added. (Yohan Perera)
