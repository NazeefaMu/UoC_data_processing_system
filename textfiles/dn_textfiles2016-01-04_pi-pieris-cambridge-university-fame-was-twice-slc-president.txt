P.I. Pieris of Cambridge University fame was twice SLC president

Percival Ian Pieris who died on Friday at the age of 82 following a long illness was twice president of Sri Lanka Cricket and in both circumstances it was certain forces within the Cricket Board that ensured his exit.
Pieris’ first term as president of the Cricket Board in 1989 lasted just four months. He resigned on principle on an issue involving the submitting of names to the then Sports Minister Nanda Mathew to form the national selection committee. He and the Cricket Board’s executive committee did not see eye to eye on the need to follow the instructions of the Sports Minister. Pieris’ decision to resign was the first by a Cricket Board president in Sri Lanka.
“It took everybody by surprise,” recalled Pieris in an interview. “They couldn’t find a suitable person for the post because no one was willing to become president. Then they appointed a politician Lakshman Jayakody.” Jayakody lasted for six months before Pieris was again elected president for a second term in June 1990.
“I had a lot of support from the clubs and they wanted me to come as president and persuaded me to stand again for election against Jayakody. Lakshman was a perfect gentleman.
He never used political influence to get votes which politicians can do. Eventually I beat him and became president again but after one year they got rid of me,” Pieris said.
During his second term Pieris along with S Skandakumar who was secretary did a lot of ground work to get international tours started to Sri Lanka for since the Pettah bus stand bomb blast in 1987, no team was willing to tour the country due to the security situation at the time.
“We worked hard to convince a touring side to come again to Sri Lanka. Skanda was a very able administrator and talker and we eventually managed to convince the Australian Cricket Board to send their Academy side in 1990. It broke the five-year drought.
The manager of the team Cameron Battersby from Queensland gave a good report about us which convinced the ACB to send their senior team to Sri Lanka in 1992 with Battersby as manager,” said Pieris. “My period as president was bad times. It was during the JVP insurrection in 1989 and we didn’t have any money.
No one was willing to come forward to sponsor a tournament. We had a simple scheme to take cricket out of Colombo. Michael (Tissera) and I travelled the country and spoke to people but we ran short of money,” he said.
Pieris represented his country from 1953 till 1967 and had a distinguished cricket career playing as a top order batsman for S. Thomas’ College, Mt Lavinia and as a right-arm opening bowler for SSC, Cambridge University and All-Ceylon (as the national team was then known).
At S. Thomas’ College, Mt Lavinia for whom he played first eleven cricket for four years from 1950 Pieris was considered primarily a batsman who could bowl, but by the time it came to his final year his bowling had developed so much that he was considered a bowling all-rounder and opened bowling for the school.
Pieris’ best years at S Thomas’ was in 1952 and 1953 when they beat traditional rivals Royal College by eight wickets and by an innings and 34 runs respectively. Pieris had a match bag of eight wickets in 1952 and the following year as captain he took six wickets in the match and scored a brilliant century (123) sharing in a record fifth wicket stand of 187 with Geoff Wijesinghe (64).
While at school Pieris made his international debut for his country when he was picked to play against Lindsay Hassett’s Australian team in 1953. He later joined SSC, but one of his ambitions was to play on the hallowed turf at Lord’s.
With the help of Gamini Goonesena, a top class all-rounder who played for Sri Lanka, SSC and Cambridge University, Pieris who had enough academic qualification managed to secure a place at Cambridge University.
He played cricket three years for the University from 1956 under Michael Melluish, Gamini Goonesena and Ted Dexter.
Among his team mates were Bob Barber and Roger Prideaux who later went to play for England and Ian McLachlan who played for Australia. Pieris didn’t play in the traditional match against Oxford University at Lord’s in his first year, but in 1957 and 1958 he was a member of the side that beat their rivals.
Pieris graduated with Honours degree in Economics and joining Richard Pieris Company served them for 40 years before retiring in 2002 as its Deputy Chairman/Managing Director.
Pieris’ best contribution for his country was as a batsman at No. 11 when he scored 46 not out (1 six, 7 fours) in an entertaining last wicket partnership of 110 in 53 minutes with Neil Chanmugam (72) in the unofficial Test against West Indies at P Sara Oval in March 1967.
Recalling that innings Pieris said: “I was angry with the captain, the selectors and with everybody because I was sent to bat at no. 11. I felt that there were many who were sent before me. I was so angry I thought to myself that I am going to show these chaps that I can bat.
Fortunately for me Neil also stuck there. That’s how I scored 46 not out fuelled in cold fury.”
Reflecting back on his career, Pieris once said, “All my life was memorable. Wherever I went I did many things in many spheres on the cricket field and off it which were delightful memorable days. The four years at S. Thomas’ of course is very special. The Royal-Thomian match in this country is very special so I would say they were memorable.”
If there is one thing that Pieris regretted doing in life was to stop being active in sports. Apart from cricket he also played golf and tennis. However a back problem which he developed forced him to stop all sports in 2003 and it plagued him till his death. He was married to Gunvor (Gun) of golfing fame.
