Coming down from Finance to Highways!


	

It is no secret that there is now a tussle going on for the Ministerial portfolios which is typical on the eve of the formation of any government. The most coveted and therefore the most in demand of all portfolios, according to informed sources, is the Finance one.
The first to express his aspiration to hold this key responsibility at a meeting where the Big Two were present was the one who earlier held a high position in the opposition now back in Diyawanna despite losing the electorate he tendered. “I have been in politics long enough and there is no purpose for me to function in the opposition at this age. I would like to handle an important subject like Finance now,” the senior politico had said. However, his earnest appeal had gone unheeded. He is not likely to get even a part if this portfolio is divided into two, they say.
This stalwart’s request that he be appointed the Deputy to the Defense also had failed to get a positive response. Now he is to be assigned the job of looking after the Highways, they say.
