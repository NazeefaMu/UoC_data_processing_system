National Freedom Front (NFF) leader and opposition MP Wimal Weerawansa, who was remanded on charges of misusing government vehicles, observed ‘Ata Sil’ at the Buddhist temple inside the Welikada prison premises today, officials said.

The Prison Authorities said they had permitted him to observe ‘Sil’ because it was Poya Day.

From Wednesday, he was allowed to receive meals brought from home in place of food supplied by the prison.
