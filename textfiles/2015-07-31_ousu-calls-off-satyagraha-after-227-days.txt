OUSU calls off Satyagraha after 227 days


	

The members of the Open University Students Unity (OUSU) called off their Satyagraha which was held for the past 227 days demanding that the excessive course fees be reduced.
The Satyagraha was called off after representatives of the student’s unity met University Grants Commission (UGC) Chairman Prof. Mohan de Silva.
The Satyagraha began on December 17, 2014 by members of the OUSU and the Inter University Students' Federation (IUSF) accusing the authorities of having increased fees excessively and of attempting to privatise the Open University where there is a semi-government management.
OUSU Convener Amila Sandaruwan said Prof. De Silva who met them on Wednesday, had assured that the fees would be reduced and to permit the students who were stopped from attending lecturers to do so again.
The students held a protest outside the UGC on Wednesday and 10 students were given an opportunity to meet the UGC Chairman sort out the contentious issues.
The university students said the course fee had increased from Rs.4,180 rupees to Rs.62,000 which the students could not afford.
Meanwhile, IUSF Convener Najith Indika said the discussion was a great victory and that they would not give up their struggle for the right of free education.
“The struggle will continue till the Open University becomes an educational institute where there will be no fees to pay,” he told the students who had gathering outside the University yesterday.
Mr. Indika said they had to face various obstacles including restraining orders from Court but nothing would prevent them from continuing their struggle. (Piyumi Fonseka)
