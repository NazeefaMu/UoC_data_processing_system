In its history spanning 76 years, the No.1 Bank in Sri Lanka, the Bank of Ceylon has always stayed true to its mandate of being the Bankers to the Nation. 
As it enters into its next phase of evolution, the bank has embarked on an ambitious transformation journey named “Wenesa” to further enhance its leadership position and to offer its customers unparallel customer service. The transformation program covers multiple facets of the bank and aims at building the bank’s capabilities to provide its valued customers unmatchable and best in class banking services across the nation.
Branch transformation is one of the key pillars of this program wherein 200 branches across the island are being transformed into “BOC Fortune Branches”. The bank has already established 5 such fully functional Fortune Branches. These fortune branches will completely change the paradigm of banking in Sri Lanka by setting new standards for customer service. 
As soon as one enters a BOC Fortune Branch the first thing one will notice is the new branch layout which is extremely spacious and aesthetically pleasing.
A new customer seating lobby has been designed to maximize customer comfort while transacting at a branch. Gone are the days where there would be long queues or frustrated customers rushing from one counter to another. Instead customers can be comfortably seated after obtaining a token number from the state of the art Queue Management Machine. 
During the short waiting period, customers can browse their smartphones or laptops by availing the free Wi-Fi access provided by the bank. Once the token number is called out and displayed on the mounted TVs, the customer can walk up to the new seated counters and get all their banking needs fulfilled in one sitting be it account opening, cash or cheque deposit, bill payment or any other inquiry. 
Another noticeable feature in the BOC Fortune Branches is the “SmartZone”. This is a 24x7 fully digitized banking service area consisting of ATMs, Cash Deposit Machines and Internet Banking Kiosks. The new age Cash Deposit Machines have been witnessing phenomenal customer adoption at the BOC Fortune Branches, over 50% of the cash deposit transactions are now being carried out through these machines. 
In addition to the new branch layout, BOC Fortune Branches offer a revolutionary “No Pass-book” saving account named “BOC SmartGen”. This universal banking savings account allows customers the flexibility to transact at any BOC branch because their details including signature, identity and image will be captured digitally at the time of opening the account and will be updated to a centralized system instantly. BOC “SmartGen” customer will also be able to enjoy free internet banking access, free instant SMS alerts on transactions and free monthly email statement. It should be noted that this product is the country’s first savings account which is fully active instantly upon opening of the account and customers can enjoy all said benefits from that moment the account is opened. 
The bank has also streamlined internal processes at these BOC Fortune Branches so that all services can be delivered in the fastest possible time. These new processes have significantly reduced customer waiting time in branches. While speed of service has been ensured, the BOC Fortune Branches also focus on enhancing customer comfort. The new branches have a special lounge for customers who seek personal attention. These lounges allow customers to receive personalized attention from the Branch Manager whenever required. 
Branch Transformation is only one of the components of the “Wenesa” program, which the bank has launched in partnership with the world leading consulting firm, The Boston Consulting Group (BCG) India Ltd. All aspects of this program seek to raise the bar on customer service and aim at ensuring that customers across the nation receive a world class banking experience when they bank with the Bank of Ceylon.
