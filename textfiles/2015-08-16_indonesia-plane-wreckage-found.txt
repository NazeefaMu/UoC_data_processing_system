The wreckage of an Indonesian plane carrying 54 people has been found in the remote Papua region, officials say.
The Trigana Air flight left the regional capital Jayapura for Oksibil in the south at 14:21 local time (05:21GMT), but lost contact.
Indonesia's transport minister told reporters the aircraft had been found in the Bintang highlands region of Oksibil, where it was supposed to land. It is not yet clear if there are any survivors. (BBC)
