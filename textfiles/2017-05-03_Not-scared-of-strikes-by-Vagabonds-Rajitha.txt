The Minister of Health Rajitha Senarathne stressed that the government was ready to face strikes launched by vagabonds with the motive of toppling the government.

The Minister said that the media has reported that the GMOA and the Joint Opposition were getting ready to launch an island-wide strike, and a study of it had revealed that it is a conspiracy. He also said that it is apparent that the GMOA is engaged in this conspiracy to obtain power for the Joint Opposition.

The Minister made these comments on the proposed strike to be launched by the GMOA and some trade unions on Friday. The government would not allow murderers and rogues who were defeated at the last presidential elections to wrest power again. He said further that present issues can be resolved with discussions and reiterated that they were ready to face these strike threats.
