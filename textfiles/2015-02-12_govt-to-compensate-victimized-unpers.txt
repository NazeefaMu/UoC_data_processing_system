A memorandum will be submitted to the Cabinet soon to provide redress to those who had been subjected to political victimisation from 1994 to 2015, UNP General Secretary and Minister Kabir Hashim said today.
Mr. Hashim told a media briefing that at least 30,000 persons who were subjected to political victimisation from the UNP alone would benefit from this move.
The UNP General Secretary who referred to a party which was held at Temple Trees for UNP organizers, provincial council members and others yesterday said its expenses were borne by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. “Only private funds of Mr. Wickremesinghe were used for this get-together,” Mr. Hashim assured. He said this was held to felicitate all UNPers who worked towards the victory of common opposition candidate Maithripala Sirisena at the Presidential elections this year.
Meanwhile Mr. Hashim said the UNP had decided to strengthen its party machinery to face the upcoming general elections.
Responding to a question raised by journalists as to whether the return of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa to politics would be a challenge to the UNP, he said it would not as the party was able to beat the ruling party candidate at the presidential elections despite the claim made by many that it would be difficult for the opposition to defeat him. “We are confident that the UNP would get a majority of seats at the general election,” he said.
