Attorney General Yuwanjan Wanasundara Wijethilake yesterday ordered the arrest of Colombo District United National Front MP Hirunika Premachandra over an abduction of a person last month.  
AG Wijethilake who retired yesterday sent out the arrest order as one of his last official orders. Having studied CID reports relating to the abduction of 34-year-old Amila Priyanga Amarasinghe at Dematoagdoa on December 21, the outgoing AG ordered Director Criminal Investigation Department (CID) to make the arrest of female parliamentarian. 
MP Premachandra is to be arrested over the abduction and conspiracy to do so in a defender vehicle belonging to her together with eight of her bodyguards. Earlier on two occasions she was questioned over her involvement in the incident. 
The AG has earlier asked the media institutions including television channels to hand over to him the visuals relating to the incident including those of a media briefing held by the MP following the alleged abduction.
During the magisterial inquiry the court has also ordered telephone service providing companies to provide details of telephone conversation pertaining to MP Premachandra and other suspects during the abduction.
In his statements the victim had said that the MP was personally involved in the assault but she had dismissed the allegation and said that she only talked to the victim over an alleged illicit relationship he was having with the wife of a member of her staff.
On Wednesday, January 6, eight suspects who were taken into custody over the alleged abduction and assault of a person over a domestic dispute, were released on bail. The suspects were bailed after they were identified at an identification parade before Colombo Magistrate Court. (Susitha R. Fernando)
