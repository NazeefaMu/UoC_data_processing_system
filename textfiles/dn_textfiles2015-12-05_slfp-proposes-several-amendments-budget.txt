'SLFP proposes several amendments to Budget'

 
The SLFP has proposed several amendments to Budget 2016 to make it more people friendly, Labour and Trade Union Relations Minister W.D.J. Seneviratne said.
Addressing a press conference at the SLFP headquarters yesterday, the minister said these amendments were discussed during a meeting with Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake recently.
He noted the SLFP objected to the merger of the EPF and ETF funds as the trade union representatives they met were against this move. "They were of the view that the EPF and ETF funds must be managed under the Central Bank," he said.
"However, they also had favourable opinions to have a pension.We expressed these concerns, and the Prime Minister agreed to keep the fund under the Central Bank and not to merge the two funds. The money in these funds will be managed in a proper manner and a committee has been appointed look into the suitable steps," he explained.
He added the SLFP also proposed to either revoke or bring down the Emission Tax of Rs.5,000 to Rs 2,000. The minister said the Prime Minister and the Finance Minister also agreed to reconsider the revisions proposed to the fertilizer subsidy after the SLFP pointed out the need to extend it to other cultivations as well in addition to the paddy cultivation.
Another amendment proposed by the SLFP was to reduce the tax imposed on electric vehicles.
