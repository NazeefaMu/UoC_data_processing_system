SL's Political crisis - Lord Naseby unhappy over Sir Hugo Swire’s statement


	

Commenting on the political situation in Sri Lanka, British Parliamentarian Lord Naseby has said he was unhappy that former British junior minister put down a question suggesting what happened in Sri Lanka was unconstitutional.

“That is not the law, I believe, of the UK Parliamentarian. You have your own Constitution. I have been very careful in my fifty years of service. I have never been supporting any one party nor doing any business. I would suggest my colleague that they should do exactly the same,” he said.

Former Foreign Secretary Sir Hugo Swire in the House of Commons earlier drawing attention to the political crisis in Sri Lanka asked the Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt to point out to the Sri Lankan President that the international community recognizes Ranil Wickremesinghe as the legitimate Prime Minister of Sri Lanka and only a vote in parliament can change his status.
