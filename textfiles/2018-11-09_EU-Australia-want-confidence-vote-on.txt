The Ambassadors of the European Union (EU) and the Australian High Commissioner said the opportunity must be provided to demonstrate a vote of confidence when parliament reconvenes on November 14.  

In a statement, the Ambassadors of the European Union, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Romania, the High Commissioner of the United Kingdom, as well as the Ambassadors of Norway and Switzerland said they took note of the summoning of Parliament as indicated in the Gazette.

“We consider it essential that Parliament be allowed to demonstrate its confidence by voting immediately when reconvened, in order to resolve the serious uncertainties currently facing the country,” they said. 

The envoys said any further delay could damage Sri Lanka’s international reputation and deter investors.

“Respect by all stakeholders for the provisions of the constitution will be important to maintain the confidence of the Sri Lankan people in democratic governance and the rule of law,” the statement said.

Meanwhile, Australia's High Commissioner to Sri Lanka Bryce Hutchesson said Australia is seriously concerned at reports that opportunity for a confidence vote will be denied when Sri Lanka’s Parliament reconvenes. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
