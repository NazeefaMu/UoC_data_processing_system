Spikes Asia, the Asian Pacific Festival of Creativity returns to Singapore to celebrate the best creative communications from across the region. This year, 95 jury members from 18 countries will convene to champion outstandingly brave and culture-defining work and the Jury is composed of more female leaders than ever before: 49%. 

Speaking on the announcement, Joe Pullos - Festival Director, Spikes Asia said, “Every year, the winners of Spikes Asia act as the barometer of creativity in the region, spotlighting truly ground-breaking work that is defining the industry landscape. Spikes Asia jurors are of the highest quality and calibre, and it is this combined with rigorous judging processes that ensure only the most deserving work is awarded and celebrated. In bringing together a diverse mix of agencies and brands to discuss, dissect and thoroughly analyse the work, these jury members will move the boundaries of Asian creativity and celebrate regional champions. And we’re delighted that we’ve almost reached parity in terms of gender split this year, something we’ve been working towards for the past number of years.” 

Judging of the work entered into the Spikes Asia Awards takes place throughout the three days of the Festival. The entry deadline for this year’s Festival is this Friday 17 August and entrants can contact a dedicated team of experts who can help advise with any queries about submitting work or meeting deadlines.
