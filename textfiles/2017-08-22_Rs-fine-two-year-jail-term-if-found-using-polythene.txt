A 10,000-rupee fine and a two-year term of imprisonment will be imposed if found guilty of using polythene and plastic when the ban becomes legally effective from September, the Central Environmental Authority (CEA) said. It said the production, sale and use of polythene of less than 20 microns would be banned from September 1.

The CEA requested people to use biodegradable and environmental friendly material. (Sheain Fernandopulle)
