Political appointees run the show


	

Some minor employees of a government hospital located in an area named after a jungle are said to be harassing and scolding the indoor patients. These employees, mostly male attendants who happen to be political appointees, behave in a cavalier manner with a callous disregard for the self-respect of the indoor patients, they say.




The medical officer in charge of the hospital has turned a blind eye to the misbehaviour of the errant employees as they are supporters of a powerful politico.


Whenever a high official of the hospital pulls up these employees, they would retort: “We don’t fear anyone. We do things the way we want.”
