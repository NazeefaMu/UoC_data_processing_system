Businessman and Qatar Ambassador A. S. P. Liyanage was tipped to be appointed as the Governor of the Eastern Province, sources said.

He would be appointed as the Eastern Governor after the post fell vacant following Governor Austin Fernando's appointment as the Secretary to the President last week.

A. S. P. Liyanage, who was in Qatar, reported to have arrived in Sri Lanka today, to meet the President. He was appointed as the Sri Lankan Ambassador to Qatar in March by President Maithripala Sirisena.

Earlier, Mr. Liyanage told the Daily Mirror that the President first wanted to appoint him as a Provincial Governor but because there were no vacancies he was appointed as the Ambassador to Qatar. (Darshana Sanjeewa)
