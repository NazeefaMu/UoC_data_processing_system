The death toll from a brazen attack on Afghanistan’s largest military  hospital by terrorists disguised as medics has risen to 49 with dozens  wounded, a senior health official said on Thursday.


Salim  Rassouli, director of Kabul hospitals, said 49 people had been killed in  the attack on Sardar Daud Khan Hospital on Wednesday and at least 63  were injured.


Some uncertainty remained over the exact figures and  one security official said more than 90 people had been wounded.  Earlier estimates had put the number of dead at 38, with 70 injured.


The Islamic State claimed the attack through its Amaq news agency.  The group also posted photos that it said were taken by its fighters  within the hospital and an image of the five fighters who were  purportedly involved in the attack. 


The terrorists rampaged  through the 400-bed hospital, shooting doctors, patients and visitors  and battling security forces for almost six hours in a sophisticated  operation.


Mohammad Nabi, a doctor at the hospital who escaped with a broken  leg, said it had been difficult to comprehend what was going on  initially as the terrorists in doctors’ white coats took out concealed  weapons and began shooting.


“We were shocked when we saw AK-47s in  their hands firing,” he said. “They killed our patients in their beds  and they killed our doctors.”
