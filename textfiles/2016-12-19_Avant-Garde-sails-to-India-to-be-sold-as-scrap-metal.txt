Avant- Garde sails to India, to be sold as scrap metal


	

The Avant-Garde vessel left for India on Saturday (17), after the Galle Chief Magistrate Nilupuli Lankapura ordered its release to the Sri Lanka Shipping Company on a bond of Rs. 35 million last month.

The ship, which is to be sold for scrap metal, sailed under a new captain as its captain is still in remand custody. The Shipping Company is required to present a report on the process to the Galle Magistrate within a week.  

The ship was taken into custody by the Sri Lanka Navy in October last year and anchored in the Galle port on charges of transporting illegal weapons and ammunition. (D.G. Sugathapala)
