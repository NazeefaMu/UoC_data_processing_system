A portion of the profits earned by our national carrier SriLankan Airlines will be allocated for the development of the health and education sectors once it is converted into a Public-Private Partnership (PP), Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said yesterday.

The Prime Minister had said this while addressing the management of the national carrier when he met them yesterday.

He emphasised that a portion of whatever profits earned by SriLankan Airlines would be allocated for the benefit of the general public and they had decided that health and education were the sectors that were most deserving of this assistance.

Premier Wickremesinghe had told the management of SriLankan Airlines that they would find a business partner for the national carrier soon and advised them to work together with the new partner while keeping in mind that the ultimate goal was to convert the airline into a profit-making venture.
