The European Chamber of Commerce of Sri Lanka (ECCSL), the American Chamber of Commerce (AMCHAM) and the Delegation of German Industry and Commerce in Sri Lanka (AHK Sri Lanka) said yesterday they were gravely concerned about the present political uncertainty and upheaval in the country.

Issuing a statement, they said,” We are of the view that the current situation will result in many adverse economic and social consequences to the country, if it remains unresolved. We would like to highlight that foreign investors and potential businesses are increasingly losing confidence in the reliability of the business environment of Sri Lanka and are reluctant to enter the Sri Lankan market due to the current instability. Most of our members who are established in Sri Lanka and whom have been surveyed are already experiencing negative impacts on their businesses

We request the relevant political authorities to ensure a stable and reliable business environment through the legal and democratically established institutions as soon as possible. It has been observed that decision making procedures and Government processes have been adversely impacted and in some cases financial damage has been caused to business. We appeal to all parties, political or otherwise, to respect the rule of law to avoid FDI outflow and to enable us to continue promotion of FDI to Sri Lanka. We remain dedicated to the cause of promoting Sri Lanka to European and American investors and to promote fair business and sustainable bilateral trade,”
