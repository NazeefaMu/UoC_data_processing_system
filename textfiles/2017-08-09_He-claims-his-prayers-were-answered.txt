Intriguing stories about a purohita now at the centre of a multi-billion scam are galore these days. 

 


Some Blue party big guns out to drive in the last nail into the beleaguered purohita’s political coffin charge that a section of the Green party is trying their best to shield the man caught with his pants down. 


Meanwhile, another top-team purohita leading a minor political party is said to be going round telling all and sundry that nothing but his supplications at Kovils had produced the results.
