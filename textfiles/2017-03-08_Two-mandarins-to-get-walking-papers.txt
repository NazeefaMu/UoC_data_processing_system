Two mandarins to get walking papers


	



 

Two white collar bigwigs at secretarial level are about to get the walking out papers, they say.

 


One of them is a character whose name was mentioned in connection with the gazette notification that triggered a big hullabaloo in the country. Those at the top in yahapalanaya have alleged that the high-ups occupying key positions in the nerve-centre of the country’s economy have been sitting on files instead of taking important decisions and implementing key plans of the government.


The other bigwig facing the chop is the one holding the highest position at secretarial level at the country’s main secretariat. His successor’s name is already being mentioned in official circles, they say.
