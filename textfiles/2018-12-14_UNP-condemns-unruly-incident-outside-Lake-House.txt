The United National Party (UNP) today condemned the unruly incident which had taken place at Lake House on Thursday evening and said a future UNP-led government would take action against those who were responsible for it.

UNP MP Nalin Bandara Jayamaha said his party condemned the incident that took place near Lake House as soon as the Supreme Court gave its ruling on the dissolution of Parliament.

“We condemn both incidents that took place on Thursday and the one which took place on October 26,” he said. (Yohan Perera)
