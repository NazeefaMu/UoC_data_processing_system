Former UPFA MP, Sajin De Vass Gunawardana, who has a case for allegedly failing to reveal his assets, surrendered his passport today to Colombo Chief Magistrate’s Court after his return from abroad.
Earlier the Magistrate permitted to release the impounded passport of the former MP and allowed to travel to Singapore for a five-day visit to seek medical treatment and ordered to return the passport following his return to Sri Lanka.
Appearing for Sajin, Counsel Kamal Gunawardane produced the passport and medical treatment reports before the Magistrate today.
The Magistrate decided to impound the passport again and fixed the trial of the case for December 15. (Shehan Chamika Silva)Video by Court Prasanna
