UNP claimed that it will occupy the benches meant for the government when Parliament meets tomorrow.

UNP MP Sujeewa Senasinghe revealed this at a media briefing held this evening.

“We will occupy the benches meant for the government parliamentarians when the House meets as we have emerged as the legitimate government as a majority has rejected the administration led by the newly appointed Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa,” he said.

“We hope the Speaker and the staff in the House will provide seats for us on government benches,” he added.

He also defended the Speaker’s decision to take up a voice vote. “There are provisions for the Speaker to call for a voice vote when members cause a disturbance without a debate or a vote taking place,” he said.

It was revealed that discussions are underway to decide on the next course of action and to ensure normalcy in the country. (Yohan Perera)
