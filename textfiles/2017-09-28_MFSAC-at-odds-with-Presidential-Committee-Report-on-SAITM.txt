MFSAC at odds with Presidential Committee Report on SAITM


	

The Medical Faculty Students’ Action Committee (MFSAC) said yesterday they could not agree with the Presidential Committee Report on SAITM.

MFSAC Acting Convener Susitha Priyankara told a news conference that they had no faith in this report which was headed by Deputy Minister Dr. Harsha De Silva.

“Although the committee promised to make the report following discussions with relevant authorities, they never sought our opinion. They have not even considered the opinion of the Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA). All committee members are SAITM biased,” he added.

He said some 7, 200 students attached to state medical faculties boycotted lectures for months demanding an immediate solution to the issue.

Meanwhile, Deputy Minister Dr. Harsha De Silva told Daily Mirror that he could not comment with regard to this concern. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)
