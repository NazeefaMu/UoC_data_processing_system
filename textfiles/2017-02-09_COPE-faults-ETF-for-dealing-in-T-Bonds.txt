The Employees' Trust Fund (ETF) has no ability to function as a primary dealer of Treasury Bonds, the report of the Parliamentary Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) said.

The COPE report was presented in Parliament yesterday. “The committee focused its attention on the inability of the ETF to work as a primary dealer,” it said.. It also reported that the ETF had invested Rs.200 million in Treasury Bonds through other institutions without calling for bids.

The committee has asked the ETF authorities to submit a report if its dealership could not be suspended. However, the COPE report said, the ETF had not informed the committee of the recommendations it had made regarding its primary dealership.

The report said no investigations had been conducted of the investments made by the ETF in recent years. (Yohan Perera)
