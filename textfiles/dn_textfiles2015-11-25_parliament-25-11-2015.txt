[PARLIAMENT - (25-11-2015)]

Moves to develop Matara - PM
Development projects for Southern Province including the construction of a public hall for Matara are in the agenda to be implemented, said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
The Prime Minister made these observations responding to a question raised by Opposition member Dullas Alapperuma for oral answers in Parliament yesterday.
He said that a special meeting was held with the participation of the nine members in the Southern Province and its Chief Minister and other representatives to decide on the development programme of the province on Sunday.
The Prime Minister said another meeting will be held soon in this regard. He said Parliamentarian Dullas Alahapperuma too can participate and make suggestions at the meeting.
He said it was discussed to develop Mahinda College in Galle too. Even Hambantota and Tangalle have to be developed. “A large amount of money was spent on Hambantota without a proper plan, However, we have to yield the results, so we have decided to develop the area systematically,” Wickremesinghe said.
Matara is the only main city in the country deprived of a public hall,” Alahapperum added. “About 300 acres were acquired by the previous government in the Kottevila area for a public hall, but the project has been stranded by now,” he said.
He said compensation for certain land plots acquired for the project had not been paid.
Public-Private partnership, key to sustainable development - Malik Samarawickrama
The Public and Private partnership is key to achieve sustainable development goals, said Development Strategies and International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrama in Parliament yesterday.
He said budget 2016 has proposed to achieve sustainable development standards of country’s rural economy. Social integration is important for social development, he said.
Advanced economic principles are crucial for development. Budget 2016 has paid attention to develop the private sector.
The budget has provided relief for the needy in the country. It has focused on the expanding of the export sector, he said.
Samarawickrama said the management of government expenses is a major area. The business community will benefit from infrastructure development. The government has taken measures to create a business and export friendly environment by establishing an international financial centre in Colombo.
Minister Samarawickrema also invited all to join hands with the government to achieve future development goals.
Grade V scholarship examination:
Govt has to decide whether to continue exam process
Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam, yesterday stated that the government has to decide if the Grade V Scholarship examination which is a burden to children as well as to their parents should be continued further.
He stated that this decision should be reached at a committee headed by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
He made these observations yesterday in response to a special statement made by the Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake, under Standing Order 23(2), querying as to why nearly 19,000 children have been disappointed by depriving them of scholarship benefits in 2015 despite obtaining sufficient marks at the examination.
Education Minister Kariyawasam stated the this budget had made an immense amount of money for the development of education. “We are not in a position to find money for fulfilling the pledges made by the previous regime by targeting the election,” he said. “But the very same government had not allocated money to grant scholarships to an extra number of students, although it had been promised as an election pledge.”
In a statement Anura Dissanayake said that the government had failed to implement the proposal made in the Budget 2014 to increase the grade five scholarship from Rs 500 to Rs 1,500 and to increase the number of scholarships to 25,000 from 15,000. He said that as it was a budget proposal, successive governments had to stick to their promise.
Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said only 15,000 students were given scholarship benefits though 51,000 students have applied for the same in 2014. He said 15,000 students were given benefits in 2015 as well. “Only 15,000 scholarships have been granted each year since 2007,” the minister said. He said that there has been no slashing of the benefits of scholarship recipients.”
He further said that Mahinda Rajapaksa in his capacity as the finance minister, had made such promises during earlier budgets too, but had failed to keep the promise.
He added that Rajapaksa had earlier allocated Rs 3,000 million to rectify the salary anomalies of teachers, but had not allocated a penny.
US$ 8,000 per capita income projected by 2020
The country’s next target is to increase the per capita income to US$ 8,000 by 2020, Science, Technology and Research Minister Susil Premajayantha said in Parliament yesterday.
Participating in a debate of the second reading of the Appropriation Bill 2016, he said the per capita income is in the region of US$ 4000.
Most countries no longer offer Sri Lanka financial aid due to this, but they are willing to invest in Sri Lanka, he said.
By strengthening the economy, we have shown our skills at management. Our next step should be to enter global market places with an emphasis on technology. Attention should be paid on research and development to develop the country. It amounts to three percent of GDP today, but in Japan, it is as high as 12 percent of GDP, Premajayantha said.
‘Political stability strengthens economic and social development’
Economic and social development has taken place in the country due to political stability, said Skills Development and Vocational Training Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe in Parliament yesterday.
Political stability is the most important catalyst to economic development. President Maithripla Sirisena has won over the world today. Both the USA and India are helping the country. Even the US
Ambassador to the UN Samantha Power has appreciated President Sirisena’s commitment to abolish the Executive Presidency.
The budget has increased the vehicle emission tax and the tax on electric vehicles.
Participating in the second reading stage debate on budget proposals, the minister called for the reduction of the vehicle emission tax and the tax on electric vehicles. Minister Samarasinghe said Rs 5,000 on vehicle emission testing is too high.
“An increase of 500 percent from Rs. 1,000 to Rs. 5,000 for vehicle emission testing is very high. I hope that the government would realise that a 500 percent in fees for emission testing is not acceptable,” the minister said.
Samarasinghe said Sri Lanka is the only country that increases taxes on electric vehicles when other countries are reducing taxes on electric vehicles.
“It’s difficult to understand why the government has increased taxes on electric vehicles when other countries are reducing taxes to encourage consumers to buy electric vehicles. People should be encouraged to buy electric vehicles by reducing taxes because it has been scientifically proven that these vehicles don’t harm the environment and are environmental friendly, he said.
He said that during a visit to Paris for an International Monitory Fund conference earlier this year, Norwegian Development Minister had shown him the steps taken by Norway to promote electric vehicles among the people.
‘If promises not fulfilled, TNA to decide on support government’
Tamil National Alliance (TNA) MP Selvam Adeikkalanadan told Parliament yesterday, that the TNA has to take a decision whether to support the government or not, if the government does not fulfill TNA's requirements.
“The TNA is supporting the government. The Tamil people who voted for us expect the government to fulfill their requirements. But the promises made by the government prior to the election, have not been fulfilled so far,” the MP said.
He said that the government should take measures to enhance the living standards of the people living in the North and the East. Resettlement should take place in these areas. But provisions for resettlement have not been mentioned in the Budget proposals of 2016.
“Our schools are still not in proper condition. Provisions have been allocated for education. So the Education Minister should pay his attention on the improvement of the educational facilities of the Northern and Eastern provinces,” he said.
He also added that people in those provinces mainly depend on fisheries and agriculture.
The government should also pay attention to solve the problems facing by these farmers and fishermen.
The Indian fishing problem too had not yet been solved by the government as well as the southern fishermen who were also disrupting these fishermen.
He further said that action should also be taken by the government to provide relief assistance to those who have been affected by recent floods and repair the roads which had been damaged. He also proposed that the government establish a domestic airports in Vavuniya, Jaffna, Batticaloa and Mullaitivu, as that would help attract more investors to the North and the East.
Creating one million jobs is impossible - Bimal Ratnayake
The creation of one million employment opportunities as promised by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe is impossible owing to economic policies envisaged in the budget proposals, said JVP Parliamentarian Bimal Ratnayake.
He made these observations joining the second reading debate of the budget proposals for the third allotted day in Parliament yesterday.
He said money has not been allocated to develop industries. There is no mechanism introduced to develop the cement industry in Kankasanthurei, chemical industry in Paranthan or any other industry, Ratnayake said.
He said the Prime Minister only thinks to develop Kolpetty. He thinks this would benefit the people in rural areas like Diulpitiya Ambilipitiya and Navalapitiya.
“The Prime Minister’s objective is to develop the economy, to create a strong middle class and give land rights to the people,” he said.
“I think the objective can be achieved to a certain extent by giving land rights to people like those in estates.”
