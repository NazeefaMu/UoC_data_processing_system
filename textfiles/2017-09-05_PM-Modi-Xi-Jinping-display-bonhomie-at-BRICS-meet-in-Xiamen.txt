The BRICS Summit began in Xiamen in China on Monday, with a group photograph of leaders of the five countries and was preceded by a handshake between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping, who received the leaders of Brazil, Russia and South Africa ahead of the meeting.

 
Modi was the third leader to reach the convention centre, venue of the 9th BRICS Summit in this port city of China and was followed by Russian President Vladimir Putin. Modi is also scheduled to hold a bilateral meeting with Xi on Tuesday.  


The Summit will be the first gathering when the leaders of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa meet after New Delhi and Beijing decided on “expeditious disengagement” of their border troops in the disputed Doklam area on August 28 after over a two month standoff between them.
