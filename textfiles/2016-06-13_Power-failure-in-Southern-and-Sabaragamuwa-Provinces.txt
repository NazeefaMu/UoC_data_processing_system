A 50 minute power failure was reported from the Southern and Sabaragamuwa Provinces this morning due to tripping at the Old Laxapana and New Laxapana hydroelectric power stations, the Ceylon Electricity Board said.

The CEB said power at the station shut down when a tree fell on a transmission line from Canyon to Lakshapana. Power was restored to the provinces around 10 this morning.
