President Maithripala Sirisena today rejected the claims that the ministries had not been assigned on scientific basis and that he would take into consideration the scientific basis when gazetting subjects and institutions of the ministries.

He said at the swearing-in ceremony this morning that changes were made when assigning ministries by him in consultation with the Prime Minister.

“Some people allege that the ministries have not been assigned on scientific basis as promised. I reject that allegation. When assigning the ministries, the Prime Minister and I discussed about it and made changes. I must say that I will consider the scientific basis when the subjects and institutions of the ministries were gazetted. Most ministries which had allegations against them were changed under the new reshuffle,” he said.

He said he would discuss with the Prime Minister and take steps to gazette the institutions to the ministries on a scientific basis.
