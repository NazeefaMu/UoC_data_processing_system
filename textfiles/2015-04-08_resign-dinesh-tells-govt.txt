	Mahajana Eksath Peramuna (MEP) leader Dinesh Gunawardane today urged the government to relinquish office immediately as it had failed to muster the support to pass a financial regulation.
	He told Parliament that though the 19th Amendment was listed for debate, the Supreme Court determination had not yet been communicated.
	"Then, how are you going to take it up for debate. We are heading for disaster in our parliamentary system in this manner. People who voted for the UPFA never expected us to enjoy perks under a UNP regime. We want to lead the opposition in the interest of those people," he said.
	Mr. Gunawardena said the Government had failed miserably in its performance of duties and that it should resign forthwith. (Kelum Bandara and Yohan Perera)
