Tapping of HC Judge's phone/JO calls for inquiry


	

The Joint Opposition yesterday urged the government to investigate the alleged tapping of a mobile phone belonging to a senior High Court judge who was a member of the Bench that tried Duminda Silva and others for the murder of Bharatha Lakshman Premachandra.

At a media briefing yesterday, Opposition MP Sisira Jayakody said some media sources had reported on Tuesday that the mobile phone of this judge was tapped by the CID.

It was said that President’s Counsel Hemantha Warnakulasuriya had complained to the Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) about the phone tapping.

Mr. Jayakody said such acts were unacceptable and a broad and transparent inquiry should be launched.

When Daily Mirror contacted BASL Secretary Amal Randeniya, he said the BASL had received a letter from President’s Counsel Hemantha Warnakulasuriya informing them of the incident.

He had asked the BASL to look into the issue and take appropriate action, Mr. Randeniya said.

While declining to name the judge, he said he said he was a member of the Bench that tried Duminda Silva and eleven others.

He said the BASL's Executive Committee would decide on the action to be taken.

Meanwhile, BASL President Geoffrey Alagaratnam said at a media briefing yesterday that some tapping incidents of mobile phones belonging to judges and magistrates had been reported during the previous government and also after the present government took over. (Piyumi Fonseka)
