Chef’s Shack – Break away from the Kitchen

Everyone deserves a break, no matter what industry you work in. There are some who take it almost everyday ;), some who take it on the weekends, some who take it once a month and some who take it once a year. Now when you take that vacation, you usually end up in a tropical island, winter wonderland or maybe just in the comfort of your own home.
So, when you are a chef, you are always in the kitchen. And your cuisine goes way around the world than you actually have. And even when you do go around the world, you are still back in the kitchen teaching people your style and not really having that ‘break’ you need.
But now, Chefs from around the world have the chance to throw their knives and forks aside, pack up and make their way down to Sunny Sri Lanka (not so sunny now with the rains), and chill out at the first of a kind Chef’s Shack.
Chef’s Shack is the brainchild of the one and only celebrity chef and restaurateur Dharshan Munidasa. Known to always think out-of-the-box, he came up with this Bed & Breakfast rest stop for Chefs, Restaurateurs, Sommeliers, Wine Makers and anyone in the F&B industry.
Chef’s Shack is located at the Dharshan’s home with a very new state of the art Hacker kitchen done by Fine Furniture Pvt Ltd outfitted in Bosch home appliances. There are two bedrooms – one up and one downstairs – with 400 thread count bed sheets and duvets. Each room has a bathroom with amenities by Spa Ceylon.
And for the tech people out there who need to be on the phone will be happy to note that they have an iPod with Bluetooth enabled speakers, an iPod controlled lighting system, a Nespresso machine, safe, a mini bar and a stock of OLU water. And the first guest to make a stop was none other than Sri Lankan born Australian Chef Peter Kuruvita who is known very well in Sri Lanka and is an award-winning chef and restaurateur, TV presenter, author, industry speaker and restaurant consultant.
“Both of us are half Sri Lankan. Chef Shack’s is a very simply concept. It’s a B&B for chefs. And making reservations here is not the same as you it’s normally done. You need to find a connection to me. For example Peter suggests this place to someone by email and they contact me etc. There is a booking fee – which is a bottle of champagne and an ingredient or two. Peter had brought in a few ingredients that are his own and these are things we expect from people, and hope this trend continues in other parts of the world as well. We are looking forward to welcoming more chefs here”, Dharshan stated at a small launch meeting at the Shack.
“I’m glad to be here. I love your kitchen. I worked with Bosch before and there’s a big company in Australia that has all the kitchens in one and it invites all chefs to come and check it out. But being here, being the first guest and checking it all out. We normally meet either when he’s finished work or when I’m flying in and out and it’s always in the restaurants. I am more than happy to say that this man has to pull himself out of the restaurant to come and work in his house.
You’ve done amazing things for Sri Lanka and for putting Ministry of Crab where anyone in Australia and the world comes to MOC. I think to have something like that makes everyone in Sri Lankan very proud because we need to keep pushing the virtues of the country out there.
I think this is a wonderful idea and incredible generous to open your house to the others. Ingredients I brought are badly packaged but made with love”, Peter stated.
“When I approached SBS and asked them can I do a show, they asked “what’s Sri Lanka, what’s it all about?” I threw the question back at them and asked them “what do you think Sri Lanka is all about?”Sri Lanka has changed, turned and come to be the destination in the world to be in”, Peter stressed.
Peter added that he has already recommended the next chef who is the English Australian Chef Matt who is a brilliant chef but will drive you mad. Peter has done something in the south coastal TAFE which is an education facility for chefs. They started it about 12 years ago. Idea was that he went, he worked with the young chefs and when he left, he had to recommend one chef. From 12 years ago to today, some of the best chefs are from that facility.
Speaking about the Chef’s Shack, room rates will differ depending on the season and as mentioned above the mandatory booking fee is a bottle of champagne and one ingredient. Dharshan invites the guest chefs to cook with him and of course share a recipe where hopefully, 200 chefs later, all those recipes can come out in terms of a Best Seller Recipe Book.
The brand new kitchen will soon be home to the set of Season 3 of Culinary Journeys with Dharshan.
