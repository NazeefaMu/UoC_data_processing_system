Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa had agreed to attend the Convention of Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) if he remained in the country at that time, Labour and Labour Relations Minister John Seneviratne said yesterday.

The SLFP’s annual convention is scheduled to be held on September 4, 2016.

On behalf of the party, Minister Seneviratne hand delivered the invitation to the former President.

“He was very cordial to me. He agreed to attend the event if remained in the country,” the Minister said.

However, he said he doubted it now with the latest decision to sack some of Mr. Rajapaksa’s loyalists from the party. (Kelum Bandara)
