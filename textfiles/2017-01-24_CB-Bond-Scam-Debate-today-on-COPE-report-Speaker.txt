Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said the COPE report on the CB bond scam would be taken up for debate today as scheduled and there was no reason for the House to act otherwise despite a petition filed against the COPE report in the Supreme Court.

He told Daily Mirror that the one-day debate on the bond scam is in the Order Paper and would be taken up for debate after the routine business of the House was over.

“The House has not been officially informed of a petition filed in the SC challenging the findings of the COPE report and therefore, the debate will be held as scheduled,” the Speaker said. (Sandun A Jayasekera)
