President Maithripala Sirisena has reportedly asked the SLFP Ministers and Deputy Ministers who voted for the no-confidence motion not to quit the government.

Social Empowerment and Welfare Minister S.B. Dissanayake told the Daily Mirror that the President asked all of them to remain in the government. Those government members who voted for the motion met the President yesterday morning.

Labour and Trade Union Relations Minister John Seneviratne said he, along with others, met the President and expressed their desire to relinquish their ministerial portfolios. He said he and his colleagues voted for the motion in keeping with a decision taken by the party as a whole.

However, the Minister did not want any of them to leave the government at this hour.

“We will discuss the President’s request and take a decision accordingly,” he said.

During the vote, 16 SLFP Ministers, Deputy Ministers and State Ministers voted for the motion along with the Join Opposition which moved the motion. (Kelum Bandara)
