MARGARET KINGSLEY (10.10.1937 - 21.08.2015)  She was a source of pride for us


	

 It is now three years since you left me lonely on August 21, 2015. I mark this third death anniversary with both the sorrow and the sweet memories of our 48 years of togetherness. Your birthday on October 10, Margaret, was a sad day without your presence.


You were a wonderful, devoted, loving, kind and affectionate person who endeared to keep everybody happy. You made all the three children professionals and made them grow up under a strict disciplinary Christian atmosphere, for which they are ever grateful. You were a great host who entertained our near and dear ones with her cooking skills. As much as I miss you, our children and grandchildren miss you a lot and speak of the stories related and the advise you gave them. You were the sixth gem in a family 6 brothers and one sister to the Rajamonies of Welihena, Kochchikade, Negombo.   


Life is miserable without you and I reminisce the 48 lovely years we spent as husband and wife. In life I loved you, in death I do love you more and miss you!   


You will live immortalized in my memories as a source of pride to the family.   


May Eternal Rest be granted to her. Oh Lord ! Let light shine on her and May She Rest In Peace.
