Western Province Chief Minister Isura Devapriya yesterday warned teachers in the western province not to request him for appointments to schools that are closest to their homes.

Addressing an event to mark the handing over of 306 teaching appointments to western province degree holders, he said though they received the appointments they really didn’t have an interest to work where vacancies truly exist.

He said teachers were meeting him with letters recommended by ministers to amend their appointment areas somewhere closer to their homes.

He questioned the purpose of receiving a government employment if the degree holders cannot work where vacancies exist. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
