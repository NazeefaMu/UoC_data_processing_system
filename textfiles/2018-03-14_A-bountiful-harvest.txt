Civil Security Department (CSD) members, who are mostly ex-LTTE combatants, are seen harvesting vegetables from one of their farms in Kilinochchi. These CSD members inject more than Rs.1,000 million to the country's economy annually. Director Chandraratne Pallegama oversees the rehabilitation and training of these soldiers.
