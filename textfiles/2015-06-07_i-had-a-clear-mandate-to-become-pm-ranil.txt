Responding to one of the charges made in the no-confidence motion against him -- that he had become the Premier through the back door -- Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said today that he had accepted the post following a clear mandate .
Addressing a meeting in Galgamuwa, Mr Wickremesinghe said he became Prime Minister through the front door and when he retires from politics would leave through the same door.
He said those who were bringing the no-confidence motion against him were trying to grab power without a mandate. "These MPs are trying to form a government without a mandate and they don't have the right to do so as the people gave me the mandate to become Prime Minister on January 9," he said. He said these MPs would have been in the wilderness today if Parliament was dissolved on January 9, immediately after the presidential election.
Mr Wickremesinghe reiterated his call for the dissolution of Parliament without delay. "There are some MPs who are playing about using the oxygen supplied by President Maithripala Sirisena, and I request Mr. Sirisena to cut this supply of oxygen,” he said.
The Prime Minister also stressed the need for a new Parliament that would effectively resolve all the issues faced by the people. He said he would be able to return to power with the support of the southern voters. We will emerge strong after the general elections and fulfil the aspirations of the people," he said.
