The government should make a clear stance promptly on the Colombo Port City project funded by China without sending mixed signals to Chinese Government jeopardizing relationships with the two nations, Former External Affairs Minister Professor G.L. Peiris yesterday said.
He said that 10 months had already passed since the government suspended the project; a move which causes heavy losses in millions of dollars to China daily.
The former minister said though there are some powerful ministers in the government who still say that strong relationship with China is vital for the development of Sri Lanka, the Prime Minister, Finance Minister as well as the Ports and Shipping Minister had made contradictory opinion on the relationships with China.
“The government has no clear-cut stance over the relationship with China or on the Port City. It has suspended the project for over 10 months without a definite decision to either cancel it or to implement it. China is an ally which has always stood by our side defending us and has made an immense contribution in the island’s infrastructure development. But the way the present government treating that country is not acceptable. Today, relationship with China has strained,” he told a news briefing. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
