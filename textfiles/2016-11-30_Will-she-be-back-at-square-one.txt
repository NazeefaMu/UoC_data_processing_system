The main character of this story is a riotously Blue top team member hailing from the South.  

 

This top team man, one from the legal tribe by the way, is reportedly running his office with an iron hand and would not allow even a crow to fly over it without his permission, they say. 


Our worthy does not allow anyone in his office to have any say in matters like calling for tenders, awarding of contracts, filling staff vacancies and creating new jobs and this attitude had irked a lady holding an important position in the office. 


The lady who was at the end of her patience had sent a comprehensive report on the activities of the top team member to the Number One in yahapalanaya.


The Number One had sent for the high flying top team member and given him a severe warning. 


The lady with ties to a powerful political family who seems to believe that the report she had sent had done the expected damage is walking on air these days, they say.


However, knowledgeable sources say that the final outcome will fall far short of her expectations!
