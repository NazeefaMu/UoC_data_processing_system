Two police officers attached to the Dodangoda Police station were suspended after a video clip emerged showing them beating a motorcyclist mercilessly. The video footage went viral.

The two police officers were Sergeant Chandrajith Kapilasiri (59558) and Constable N Arunasiri (6108). The video allegedly shows them beating up a youth last Saturday, accusing him of turning of not stopping their motorcycle when ordered to do so by them.

The victim, whose identity was being kept confidential, was videoed while he was allegedly being beaten up in broad-daylight watched by a crowd of by-standers, one of whom videoed and uploaded the incident on social media. It went viral causing many to express their displeasure at the apparent heavy-handedness of the Sri Lanka Police.

Speaking to Daily Mirror, ASP Kapila Premadasa, who is in charge of the Kalutara area, said that he had immediately launched an investigation into the matter. “We investigated the incident soon after we witnessed this video. Statements were recorded from the parties involved and a statement was also taken from the victim.

Investigations revealed that the two officers had acted with excessive force and as a result we have suspended them from service with immediate effect,” he said.

However, when inquiries were made by DM the Police Media Division refused to elaborate on the incident.

Meanwhile, the Ceylon Motorcyclists’ Association (CMA) issued a notice condemning the actions of the two police officials involved in the incident. Speaking on the matter CMA Secretary Chirantha Amarasinghe said that such heavy-handed tactics by the police should should be stopped immediately. He said nowadays motorcyclists already face enough harassment from the Traffic Police when they get on the road.

“We have complained to the Police Commission regarding the incident the occurred in Kalutara. Motorcyclists already face enough harassment at the hands of the Traffic Police. We don’t blame the whole Police Department. But due to the violent actions of a few officers the reputation of the whole department has taken a severe beating. We ask police head quarters and the Police DIG to take stern actions against officers who break the rules in this manner,” he said. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
