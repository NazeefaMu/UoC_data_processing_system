Colombo Fort Magistrate today issued notice directing the CID to be present in the Fort Magistrate's Court on December 19 for the inquiry into the bail application filed in court by former DIG Nalaka Silva’s counsel.

The bail application was taken up by Magistrate Ranga Dissanayake but had to be postponed due to the absence of the CID.

Former DIG Nalaka Silva was arrested in connection with an alleged plot to assassinate President Maithripala Sirisena and former defence secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa. (T. Farook Thajudeen)
