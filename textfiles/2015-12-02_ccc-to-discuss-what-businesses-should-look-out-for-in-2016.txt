The Ceylon Chamber of Commerce (CCC) will hold a forum titled ‘Global Economy and Sri Lanka - What Can We Expect in 2016’, with the participation of a top panel, which will include the likes of Central Bank Deputy Governor Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe and Renowned Economist Professor Razeen Sally.
The keynote speech of the seminar, which will be held on December 17, 2015 will be delivered by Dr.  Razeen Sally, under the above topic. Prof. Sally is attached to the Lee Kuan Yew School, National University of Singapore and also functions as the Director - European Centre for International Political Economy. He is also the newly appointed Chairman of the Institute of Policy Studies, Sri Lanka. 
The Singapore-based economist’s speech would be followed by a panel discussion, which will also see the participation of Hayleys Group Senior Economist Deshal De Mel and Frontier Group Head of Economic Research Shiran Fernando. The session would be chaired by Ceylon Chamber of Commerce Chief Economist Anushka Wijesinha.
The panel will discuss what Sri Lankan businesses should look out for in 2016 in the wake of the looming interest rate hike by the US Fed, outflows from emerging markets, worries on China’s growth prospects and volatile markets around the world. 
It will also focus on whether the China’s growth troubles pose risks throughout Asia, whether growth recovery in Europe is an unlikely prospect and how these elements will effect Sri Lankan businesses, particularly exporters.
The forum to be held at the Ceylon Chamber auditorium will start at 3:00 p.m. and if you’re interested in taking part in this seminar, please call 011-5588883.
