Commotion at Uva PC

The session at the Uva Provincial Council this morning ended up with a commotion as Ministers have not been appointed to the council. The proceedings of council was limited to 20 minutes as the Chief Minister was not in the assembly to answer the queries raised by the councillors. Chairman A.A Buddhadasa adjourned the sittings as nobody was in the council to answer the questions of the members.
