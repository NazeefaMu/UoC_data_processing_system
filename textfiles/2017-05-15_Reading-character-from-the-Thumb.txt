BY A.S. Fernando.
In the last article, we discussed the Thumb angled in relation to the Index Finger. That of course, is only one aspect of the formation of the Thumb.


In this article, we propose to examine several other aspects of the shape of the Thumb under following categories.

1.    Elementary Thumb
2.    Nervous Thumb
3.    Broad Thumb
4.    Hard Thumb
5.    Short Thumb
6.    Long Thumb
7.    Flexible and Supple Thumb

 

1.The Elementary Thumb:

This is shapeless and has the appearance of a chunk of flesh stuck on the hand. It is coarse and heavy. Its owner is tactless and is brutal in imposing his will on other persons.


2.The Nervous Thumb

This thumb is soft and fleshy and flat in appearance. Its owner lacks nervous balance.

 

3.Broad Thumb

Viewed from the nail side, it looks broad. This thumb also has a strong and healthy appearance. The owner possesses strong determination supported by physical strength. Aggressive and violent by nature, the owner requires guidance and restraint to contain him/her within reasonable bounds of decent behavior.

 

4.The Hard Thumb
This thumb is usually erect and close to the side of the hand. The owner Is endowed with a lot of common sense and pragmatism. He is intelligent, but lacks emotions.

 


5.The Short Thumb
Owners of this thumb need guidance and supervision, because they are so sentimental, it is seldom they use their intelligence. They like to live in a world of their own. They are often poets, painters and musicians.

 

6.The Long Thumb
The owners of this thumb are self-willed and self-reliant. They occupy positions of authority. They are intellectuals guided by intelligence rather than by emotions.

 

7.The Flexible and Supple Thumb

This thumb bends back at the first joint. Owners of this Thumb are brilliant, versatile, sentimental and generous. They are capable of adjusting themselves to suit any occasion.
