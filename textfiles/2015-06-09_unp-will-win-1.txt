The formation of a Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) government after the next general election is only dream, United National Party (UNP) Media Spokesman and Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said today.
He told a media conference at Sirikotha that the UNP has revived itself and garnered the support of the majority Sinhala Buddhist community and as such, the SLFP would have little or no chance of winning the election.
The minister said though several attempts had been made in the past to split the UNP, its members unlike those of the SLFP had made several sacrifices to save the party.
“They kept saying ‘yes sir’ to whatever was ordered by Mr. Rajapaksa. Nowadays, they are making futile efforts to get their leader to return to politics so that the investigations into cases of alleged fraud and corruption and the abuse of public resources can be ended,” the minister said.
He said the UNP would definitely win 125 parliamentary seats and provide a proper response to those who attempted to sabotage the UNP and those who stoned Sirikotha. (Piyumi Fonseka and Darshana Sanjeewa)WATCH
