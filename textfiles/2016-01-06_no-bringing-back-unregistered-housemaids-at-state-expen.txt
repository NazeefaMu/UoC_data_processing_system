Foreign Employment Minister Thalatha Athukorala said today the Foreign Employment Bureau would no longer make any effort to bring back Sri Lankan housemaids from abroad if they had not registered with the Bureau.
With this regulation coming into effect from January 1, this year, any housemaid, who had gone abroad for employment without registering with the Bureau, would not be brought back at state expense even in case of ill health, mistreatment by employers or their bodies in case of death.
The minister told a news conference that the Bureau had to spend about Rs.50 million including insurance payments last year to bring back injured Sri Lankan housemaids or the bodies in case of death even though they were employed through illegal and unregistered recruitment agencies.
“In such cases family members will have to make a payment to the Bureau. The purpose of this regulation is to minimize Lankan workers going aboard in an illegal manner,” she said. (Piyumi Fonseka)
