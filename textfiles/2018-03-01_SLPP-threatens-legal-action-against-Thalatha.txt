Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) Chairman G.L. Peiris said yesterday they would take legal action against former Foreign Employment Minister Thalatha Atukorale for allegedly transferring 30 employees who celebrated the victory of the SLPP at the local government elections.

Addressing a news briefing, he said the employees who celebrated the SLPP victory by displaying a banner and eating milk rice had been transferred to rural areas such as Jaffna, Vavuniya, Mullaitivu and Batticaloa.

“Former Foreign Employment Minister Thalatha Atukorale had transferred these employees on February 23. This is unacceptable. We will file a fundamental rights petition in the Supreme Court on behalf of the employees and also file lawsuit against the minister demanding compensation,” he said.

On a different note, he said the Cabinet reshuffle was a drama that had no impact on the people whatsoever.

“The only outcome of the reshuffle was the UNP being bolstered. It still holds economic nerve centres under its command. However, one should bear in mind that handing over the Law and Order Ministry to Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe acts in favour of former Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran. If Mahendran were arrested, the UNP will be put in a difficult position based on the information he reveals. Therefore, the UNP is not keen in putting Mahendran behind bars,” he said.
