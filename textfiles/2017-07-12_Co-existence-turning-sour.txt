Co-existence turning sour?


	



 

A senior purohita in the top team had given a jolt to the heads of financial establishments and other statutory bodies coming under the purview of his Ministry when he exhorted them not to heed any summons from their state purohita adding that there was need for them to call on him regarding any official matter either.

 


The purohita had told these high-ups: “Remember he is just a nominal one. None of the Ministry subjects has been assigned to him by the Gazette notification. Therefore, meeting him on any official matter would serve no purpose.” He had added in a sterner tone: “I am your appointing authority and I did appoint you all. You have to carry out only my instructions!”


Thereafter, these heads of state establishments under the Ministry had sought some clarifications. And the purohita in response had repeated his orders and asserted that he would not tolerate any failure on their part in carrying out his instructions. 


While discussing the purohita’s instructions later, one corporation head had told the others jokingly: “Remember if any of us is caught meeting the state one even by accident hereafter, it would be better for him to take a plunge down from this floor of the World Trade Centre than face the consequences!”
They also had recalled that the state purohita was not provided with office space to run his office for several weeks after the swearing-in.


One of the corporation heads who attended the meeting with the purohita in the top team had later conveyed to the state one all that transpired at the meeting, they say.
