LONDON, (Daily Mail), 0203.2017- Thr British PM has vowed to face down peers over the Brexit Bill and stick to her timetable for triggering Article 50.   


Downing Street has insisted the PM’s plans are ‘unchanged’ despite the stinging defeat in the House of Lords.   


Peers overwhelmingly passed an amendment to the crucial legislation demanding an immediate guarantee of rights for EU nationals already in the UK.The bigger-than-expected defeat by 358 votes to 256 came at the hands of an alliance of Labour, Liberal Democrats, crossbenchers and a handful of rebel Tories.
