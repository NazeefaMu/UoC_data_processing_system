A 60-year-old German national was arrested by the Jaffna Police for allegedly sexually harassing a nine year old girl yesterday.

Police said the man had allegedly called the child, who was passing by his house, after her evening class and tried to kiss her in his bedroom.

When she had screamed for help, the neighbors had intervened and the child was allowed to go home. The foreign national had given the child some money to pacify her.

Police said the parents of the child had lodged a complaint at the Jaffna Police when the child had related the incident to them when she returned home.

The German national, who makes a trip to Sri Lanka once a year, is said to own a hotel in Jaffna and rents a house in Kottadi, close to the child’s home, during his visit.

The owner of the rented house, a 44 year old local, was also arrested on charges of aiding abetting. Both suspects are to be produced before the Jaffna Magistrate Court today. (Darshana Sanjeewa)
