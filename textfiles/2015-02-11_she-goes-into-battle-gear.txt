	The former Madam now in the thick of political activity has begun rounding up her former loyalists. However, she does not approach them direct; she does it through a go-between, a mouthy former Minister from Uva who lost his electorate at the recent polls.

The go-between recently arranged a meeting between the former Madam and a group of one-time party faithfuls hailing from both upcountry and low-country. Pleasantries over, the former Madam launched into a tirade against the deposed Big Boss. The group meekly listened to the long harangue. Presently, assuming a more serious tone, she said she treasured their goodwill and loyalty and that she knew that she could rely on their support for her political plans. “I will confide in you with the details at the right time,” she added. The meeting ended on this anticipatory note, they say.
