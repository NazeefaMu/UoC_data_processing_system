A gem of wisdom from a sadder, but wiser deposed Boss


	


	The deposed Big Boss recently visited the Sacred City in the Deep South to attend a special Pooja at the Devalaya.

He was accompanied by a small group of supporters including the ex-Green man from Kesbewa and the Western council member of `double-cross’ fame.
On arrival in the Sacred City, deposed Big Boss found to his dismay that of all the provincial politicos, only the Pradeshiya Sabha chairman had turned up to receive him. What was worse was the gate at the entrance to the drive leading to the Maha Devalaya was closed. There was a general hustle to push open the gate and on finding it locked up,some Devalaya employees dashed away to bring the keys.
However, deposed Big Boss took a walk up to the Devalaya without waiting for the gate to be opened for his vehicle.
The special pooja over, the deposed Big Boss stepped out of the Devalaya to find a knot of  people waiting outside to greet him.
The deposed Big Boss with an arm round the Pradeshiya Sabha chairman’s shoulder addressed the small crowd of well-wishers: “I hope you all may have realized today how good our people are at worshipping the rising Sun and turning their back on the setting Sun.”
He left the place after making that wisecrack.
