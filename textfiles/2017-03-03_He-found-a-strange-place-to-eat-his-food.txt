A strange sight awaited the residents of the Nawalapitiya Town yesterday when a man was found to have climbed an electrical post holding a high tension wire, carrying with him a pack of rice and a bottle of water.

Seeing the man climbing this post workers from the electrical department who had been in the vicinity had alerted the Ceylon Electricity Board who had acted quickly to cut off the power supply, thus averting a disaster.

The police, who were called in, together with the people in the town had managed to bring the man down from the electrical post and he was rushed him to the Nawalapitiya Hospital thereafter.

The man, believed to be around fifty years of age, was identified as a resident of Ulapone. (Suranga Rajanayake)
