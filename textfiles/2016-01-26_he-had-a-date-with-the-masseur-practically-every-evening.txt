“He had a date with the masseur practically every evening…”


	


This is something hardly known to our people; there is a spa for the exclusive use of Diyawanna members where Ayurvedic massage services are provided. This spa which has been in existence for some time has become popular among the Diyawanna members only quite recently, they say.
A group of opposition members had occasion to discuss this ‘Members Only spa’ when they met in the House lobby on the final day of the sittings last week. 
“Do you know who regularly visits this health parlor seeking massage services?” one member asked his colleagues.
“No. We don’t know. If you know, tell us,” another member told him.
The member who launched the subject replied: “According to a survey done by us, it is the Cabinet one … from the South who frequents this Ayurvedic health parlour. That handsome Deputy … from Colombo also often visits this place… The Cabinet one from the South is, of course, trying his best to look young and dashing again! He had had a date with his masseur practically every evening when the House was sitting for about one month at a stretch…”    
  
“Is there anything wrong with that?” another member asked.
“There is nothing wrong with that,” replied the member who revealed the results of the survey.
