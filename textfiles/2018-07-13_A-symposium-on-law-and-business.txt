The common Latin term in law ‘Ignorantia juris non excusat’ says, ignorance of the law excuses no one. When it comes to forming a business and running it, there are a set of laws that any business must adhere to. Even though there are thousands of legal professionals to consult when a legal matter crops up, it is better to be fully aware of the laws and regulations that can affect one’s business.   

With the purpose of educating corporate leaders regarding the laws that pertain to business, the Colombo Law Society (CLS) plans to host the first ever ‘Colombo Law Biz 2018: A Symposium on Law and Business’ on 20th and 21st July. The two-day symposium will be held at the Cinnamon Grand Hotel, Colombo.   

Given the theme of this year’s symposium, the purpose of the Colombo Law Society is to bring together progressive lawyers and other professionals in and around Sri Lanka, to look into the current legal issues in business.   

Along with Chief Justice Priyasath Dep, PC as the chief guest, experts from varied fields as speakers and other resource persons who are not limited to the legal profession have also been invited for the conference.   

The keynote address of the inauguration of the symposium will be delivered by Supreme Court Justice Prasanna Jayawardena regarding ‘The impact of effective commercial litigation in an emerging economy.’   

The President of the Colombo Law Society Jagath Wickramanayake said that the event with two days full of insightful panels, is an excellent way to both network with and learn from some of the best lawyers and professionals in a variety of fields.   

“It is good to familiarize with all of the laws business must adhere to. While these rules can vary depending on the type of business, it is important that business owners are fully aware of them in order to follow them to protect both their business investments and their customers. The knowledge that they will collect from the Colombo Law Biz will empower them regarding issues involving the law and help them to prevent any legal problems,” Jagath Wickramanayake said.   

Those who attend the symposium will be able to obtain a wide range of knowledge through speeches and panel discussions on how Investment Law, Tax Law, Company Law, Employment Law, International Law, Finance Law, Public Law and Corporates and IP & ICT Law affect business.   

The closing date for registration is July 17. Those who wish to register and obtain further information should contact the CLS Office on 0112421966 or Shevonne on 0777559710 or Jagath on 0773155155.
