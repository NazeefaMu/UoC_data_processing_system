JO for electoral reforms favouring JVP, smaller parties


	

The joint opposition said today it was prepared to push for electoral reforms which would favour smaller political parties such as the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP).

It said it was of the view that the proposal to annul the votes of a political party polling less than five percent of the total votes was a blow to many of the smaller political parties.

“Several of the smaller parties like the JVP will be affected by the proposed cut-off point. Therefore, we will join them to reduce it to two or three per cent,” JO National Organiser Dullas Alahapperuma told a news conference. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
