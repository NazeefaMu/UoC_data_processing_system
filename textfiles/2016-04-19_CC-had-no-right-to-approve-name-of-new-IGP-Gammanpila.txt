CC had no right to approve name of new IGP: Gammanpila


	

Taking exception to the decision of the Constitutional Council’s (CC) to grant approval to the appointment of Senior DIG Pujith Jayasundara as the 34th Inspector General of Police (IGP), Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) General Secretary and MP Udaya Gammanpila claimed the appointment was both illegal and unethical.

Addressing a media briefing today, MP Gammanpila said the CC’s approval of Mr. Jayasundara as the IGP went against the 19th Amendment to the Constitution as President Maithripala Sirisena had recommended three senior Police officers to the post of IGP in the wake of the retirement of former IGP N.K. Illangakoon.

“According to the 19th Amendment to the Constitution the President should only recommend one name to the CC and its duty was to approve or disapprove the President’s recommendation. However, the CC has arbitrarily selected Mr. Jayasundara as the IGP from three nominees sent to it and referred his name to the President,” he added.

MP Gammanpila recalled the similarity between this appointment and the appointment of the present Attorney General in the wake of the retirement of former AG Yuwanjan Wijeyatilake where seniority was not considered.

Additionally, he said the participation of Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka as a part of the CC which took the decision to appoint SDIG Jayasundara as the new IGP, was wrong as Minister Ranawaka was a suspect in four Police investigations despite the request made by them to refrain from his involvement in it.

“Mr. Jayasundara is carrying out investigations into the controversial accident that took place in Rajagiriya where Minister Ranawaka was an accused. Now he has received the blessings of Minister Ranawaka for the post of IGP and as a result he would be obligated to Minister Ranawaka, which sets a bad precedent,” he added.
