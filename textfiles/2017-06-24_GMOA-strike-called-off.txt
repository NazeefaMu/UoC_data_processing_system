The Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) has called off their trade union action with immediate effect following a discussion held with   President Maithripala Sirisena,  GMOA said.

GMOA Secretary Dr. Naveen De Soysa said President Sirisena had agreed to provide the Government’s stance on the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) to the Supreme Court through the Attorney General.
He said the President had requested the striking doctors to conclude the strike considering the prevailing dengue outbreak in the country.

He said the GMOA had called off its trade union action following the President’s assurance of a permanent solution to the SAITM controversy.

“President promised us to halt enrolling students to the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) and to suspend its degree awarding. He also pledged he would not let any changes to take place in the Sri Lanka Medical Council or its president,” he said.

One of the GOMA’s demands was over the Chairmanship of the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC).
Dr. De Soysa said the GMOA had stressed the importance of concluding the SAITM controversy via proposals made by the medical faculty.

Meanwhile, he said President Sirisena had also agreed make an announcement through the Presidential Secretariat regarding his stance on the matter. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
