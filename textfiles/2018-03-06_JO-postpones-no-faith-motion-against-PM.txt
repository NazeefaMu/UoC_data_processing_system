The Joint Opposition (JO) today said it decided to postpone the no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe on two grounds.

Speaking to the Daily Mirror, MP Udaya Gammanpila said the tense situation which prevailed in the country was one of the two reasons to postpone the motion.

“When JO party leaders met today, they also decided that the no-faith motion should be signed by at least couple of SLFP and UNP MPs in the government which was the second reason. Therefore, we deiced to postpone the motion,” he said.

The no-faith motion signed by JO MPs was scheduled to be submitted in Parliament today. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
