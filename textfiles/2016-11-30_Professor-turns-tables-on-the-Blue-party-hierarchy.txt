Professor turns tables on the Blue party hierarchy


	



 

The Blue party had called for the explanation from the legal professor, the chairman of the new ‘Pohottuwa’ political party for founding a new political party and becoming its chairman while being a member of the Blue political party. 

 


The reply to this letter sent by the professor has given rise to much mirth and guffaws in political circles, they say.


The professor, a legal wizard had challenged the party hierarchy to take disciplinary action first against the party member who breached the party discipline in a much grave manner by willfully breaking with the party ranks and proceeding to defeat the party’s official candidate at a past election before taking any action against him.  The ‘Pohottuwa’ party chairman has yet to receive a response to the above query, they say.
