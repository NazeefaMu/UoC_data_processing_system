The late Sunday Leader Editor Lasantha Wickrematunge’s daughter, Ahimsa in a letter to President Maithripala Sirisena over the removal of Inspector Adrian Nishantha Silva from the Criminal Investigation Department has said "Make no mistake, Mr. President. If you try to stand in the way of justice for my father & other victims of brutality, you will fail."

“Alternatively, you could wait until the independent National Police Commission or a court of law reviews your order and shoots it down. In that case you will be remembered as the President who tried to stop some of the most high-profile criminal investigations in the country — and failed,” she said in the letter.
