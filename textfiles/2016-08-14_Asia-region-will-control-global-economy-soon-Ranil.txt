States in the Bay of Bengal and those in the Asian region in general will take control of the global economy soon, Sri Lankan Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and Hunag Jifan, the Mayor of Chong-Jing said on Saturday.

The duo came out with this remark when they met each other for a discussion in Chong-Jing over a week end.

“Bay of Bengal states and the states in Asia in general such as India, China, Japan and Singapore will soon become a great force which will be controlling the global economy in the near future,” the two leaders have expressed during their discussion.

A statement from the Prime Minister’s office said Mr Jifan had assured the support of his city to Sri Lanka to make it an investment friendly nation.

Prime Minister Wickremesinghe had discussed details on the Colombo Port City project ( Financial City) with Mr. Jifan. Accordingly he had informed the Chinese Mayor that Colombo Financial City would be a financial centre between Dubai and Singapore.

The Sri Lankan premier had broadly explained Sri Lanka’s economic development programme devised by its present regime.
