Long queues at filling points, fears of fuel scarcity


	

Motorists were seen queuing up at filling stations in Colombo to refuel their vehicles fearing a possible fuel shortage due to the planned strike by petroleum workers.

Speaking to Daily Mirror some filling station owners said that they were not aware of a trade union action being launched but confirmed that no fuel tankers had arrived to replenish their fuel stocks today and acknowledged that this could potentially lead to a fuel shortage in next day or two.

However, they assured the public that they would continue to supply fuel to motorists for as long as they have stocks and they hoped that the fuel tankers would arrive some time soon and avoid a fuel scarcity in the Island.

Daily Mirror correspondents confirmed that the phenomenon was not an isolated issue but common to other areas as well with Galle, Matara, Kandy, Kurunegala as well as Kalutara also reporting long queues with motorists filling up their tanks in fear of a fuel shortage in the coming days.
