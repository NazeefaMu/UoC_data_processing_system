He distributed Ministry’s relief donations as his own


	

An ambitious son of a prominent politician too had been among some politicos who took undue advantage of the disaster caused by floods to bag a measure of cheap popularity. 

 


The young man had been distributing relief packs to flood victims transported by government vehicles draped with large banners boldly announcing a foundation named after him.


The flood aid that the son of the politician had distributed had come from relief donations the Ministry had received and he had restricted the distribution to the victims in the electoral division he is looking after.
