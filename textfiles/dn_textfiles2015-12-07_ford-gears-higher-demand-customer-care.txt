Ford gears up for higher demand with customer care

A resurgence in demand for the Ford range of vehicle in Sri Lanka has prompted the local agent Future Automobiles to spruce up and tighten customer care, a letter the new CEO sent to existing Ford owners recently revealed.
The company recently enhanced its premises at Battaramulla welcoming customers in to an expansively designed showroom promising a delightful experience within -the highlight being the wide selection of vehicles on display.
Elaborating on recent changes initiated since his appointment as Chief Executive Officer, Chamath Tennekoon said recent upgrades signaled a new era of enhanced efficiency and service focusing on customer needs.
'Besides the improvements in infrastructure, we have assembled the best possible service team headed by a Chief Technical Officer cum Head of After Sales to enhance our service delivery standards.'
He added that 'the month of December will be unique in the fact that it is FORD's Big Deal month where we offer very special deals on vehicles. This year however, we have not limited The Big Deal to just Sales but extended it to After Sales as well with a 100% Free Service Campaign for our customers, coupled with sizeable discounts on spare parts. The month will culminate with the launch of the FORD Loyalty Card Program which allows our customers to cash-in their loyalty points to get discounts on spare parts or be eligible for gifts'.
'Purchasing a premium vehicle should be a premium experience, which is what the Ford Centre offers its valued patrons. We believe Ford owners now have support and service of a quality that compares favorably with other Ford dealerships worldwide, thus making certain that Sri Lanka maintains the same benchmark levels of performance and service', he declared.
Walking into the Ford showroom, the layout ensures a pleasant browsing experience minus any crowding, and is also conducive to those customers who wish to acquire in-depth information about any particular vehicle on display.
A designated area for customer seating, easily accessible reception and sales staff, prominently displayed specifications for each vehicle and the ability to comfortably explore the models are among the enhanced experiences the showroom offers.
In addition, for those who want to truly experience the Ford promise, test-drive vehicles for each model are parked in easy access areas, eliminating long waiting times involved in bringing the vehicle to the customer.
New recruitment, a part of restructuring, enthusiastic and knowledgeable staff trained to offer customers assistance in all aspects of the purchase experience. From helping the customer choose a vehicle to providing answers to technical questions, the staff is well trained to make a visit to the Ford showrooms an experience par excellence.
