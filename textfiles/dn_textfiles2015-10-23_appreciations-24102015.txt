[Appreciations]-24.10.2015


Dr. Gamini Wijesekera:
Politician worthy of emulation
One is able and more qualified to comment on a person only after associating him for a considerable length of time. Gamini Wijesekera was one such friend whom I associated very closely. This appreciation is to mark his 21st death anniversary.
I had the opportunity of meeting Gamini Wijesekera for the first time in 1976 at the residence of Dr. Wickrama Weerasooriya. I was accompanied by Harsha Abeygunawardana and Naveen Gunaratne. They were discussing politics and Gamini’s views were very clear, interesting and thought provoking.
What Wickrama Weerasooriya told me when introducing Gamini to me was exactly at the then President J. R. Jayewardene's final election rally at Maharagama in support of Gamini. This is what Dr. Weerasooriya said: "When you step in to Gamini’s house, you feel as if you are entering a university. His father, late Prof. O. H. de A. Wijesekera was a former Vice Chancellor of the University of Colombo and a scholar in Sanskrit and Oriental languages. His brother, Dr. Jagath Wijesekara, is a consultant neurologist who practiced in Sri Lanka and is currently in the UK. All family members are graduates.
Gamini Wijesekera was educated at Trinity College, Kandy and Ananda College, Colombo. While a student at the University of Peradeniya, he joined the Samajawadee Student's Union and was a working member. After passing out as a doctor, he joined the government medical service. He also served as Secretary of the Government Medical Officers Association.
Later, Gamini resigned from government service and started his private practice in Pannipitiya. He specialized in children’s health and his dispensary was open from morning till late in the night, which was always full of patients. He became a well accepted medical practitioner in Colombo, no sooner he started practicing.
Subsequently, he entered politics and became a member of the Working Committee of the United National Party (UNP). At one of the working committee meetings, Esmond Wickremesinghe, father of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe had a sudden heart attack and fainted. Dr. Wijesekera who happened to be there immediately gave him first aid and brought him to life. At that moment, President Jayewardene got me to telephone Dr. Wallupille, the cardiologist and Wickremasinghe was taken to hospital.
Gamini, along with President Jayewardene, followed him to the hospital. Gamini was able to save Esmond Wickremasinghe's life. I have observed that Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has been a close friend of Wijesekera family ever since.
Gamini was appointed as the secretary to the Ministry of Transport in 1980, and rendered a great service.
He also served as director of several government institutions and also did honourary service at the Moratuwa University Council and the University Grants Commission.
He was the first president of the Rotary Club of Maharagama and was the President of the Cancer Hospital Committee. Also, he was a member of the Sri Lankan Cricket Board and took a keen interest in developing the game, until his death. Whenever he met Gamini Dissanayake, who he associated closely, their primary topic of discussion was cricket.
Gamini was elected to the Western Provincial Council in 1993 and was appointed as General Secretary to the UNP. Finally, he became a Member of Parliament in 1994.
He was never engaged in violent, acrimonious and vituperative politics. He strove to introduce gentlemanly politics to Sri Lanka, especially at a time when violence enveloped the Sri Lankan political culture.
He was never critical of his political opponents. Dinesh Gunawardana who contested the Maharagama by-election once told me that his opponent Gamini was a real gentleman and when Dinesh won the election, Gamini congratulated him. This was not surprising, coming from someone who always treated everyone equally, with a smile on his face.
Gamini’s wife, Daisy Wijesekera, is continuing the social work he began. Gamini’s daughter has joined the government medical practice following in the footsteps of her father, while his son is engaged in business.
We are extremely unfortunate that during the best and most productive period of his life, Gamini was snatched away from us due to a bomb attack 21 years ago. We lost an exceptional politician. Gamini was killed along with his political leader, Gamini Dissanayake and many other political representatives of the UNP.
Gamini was a social worker, a medical practitioner, a great humanist and a politician worthy of emulation.
May he attain the bliss of Nirvana!

Alexi Malcolm:
Provided yeoman service for netball
It was on December 6, 2014, I got up early morning to hear Rio's voice all the way from Germany: “Alexi Malcolm passed away last evening. Round up the W.P.N.A. members and do what you can for his funeral.”
I sat there trying to come to terms with the fact that Malcolm is no more. To the Western Province Netball Association, he was a special person. He was there for all of us. That is why the news of his death came as a shock to all of us.
My thoughts went back to our 60th Anniversary Celebrations which was on October 18. We celebrated with an open Netball Tournament and an award ceremony to felicitate past players and officials. Malcolm was awarded the “Special award for 60 years of dedication and commitment.”
It was at St. Joseph's Sport Complex that hundreds of netball players both past and present gave him a standing ovation when the chief guest and the guest of honour walked up to Malcolm (at our request) with Kumar's voice vibrating and declaring him the “Star of the evening.” We watched as he struggled to get up and thank us.
“My dream was to have someone appreciate what I have done for netball. Today my dream came true. I am the happiest man in the world today.” We did not believe then that those words of his, would be his last words to the Western Province Netball family.
His life was netball. He was so committed and dedicated to the game and worked hand in hand with past presidents and officials of the Netball Federation such as Anula Udalagama, Seetha Wickramasinghe, Trixie Jayasuriya, Cynthia and Kusuma George and many others. They maintained the highest standards and never looked for personnel glory the way it is sadly happening today. They were a unique lot who brought out the best in every player, and Sri Lanka at that time could proudly boast of well-disciplined and talented players who put their country first.
Malcolm joined the W.P.N.A. as a young man as the President of the Stadium Sports Club. His club had talented girls. They along with the Colombo Netball Club and shamrocks were our first members and after 60 years they are still with us, thanks to people like Malcolm who led us on all the way.
In the earlier days when Netball was a popular game in Sri Lanka, we all looked forward to the tournaments that Malcolm organized in the Stadium Grounds in Bambalapitiya which belonged to his father, Donowon Andree. Played under flood lights, it was any netballer's dream. It drew so many clubs to it. The 1st Netball queen, I remember, was Pamela Thajudeen of Stadium Sports Club. He organized award ceremonies for netball players. These are a few things he did, to raise the standard of netball in the country. The stadium girls called him ‘God father of netball! That in itself is a loving tribute for his dedicated service to netball in the country.
I am happy we never let him down. When Rio decided to leave the country with her husband, it was Malcolm who decided for me that we have a young set of members in the committee and train them as future leaders for the Western Province. So with a smart deputy, a very efficient committee and equally smart secretary with Malcolm's experience and dedication backing me all the way, I managed to go ahead and steer the W.P.N.A. to it's 60th anniversary last year.
When I walk down the memory lane of the Western Province Netball family, Malcolm is a very pleasant memory. We made him a life-member 15 years ago. When little Jackie Ramlan went upto garland him, he hugged her and cried. It is a beautiful memory. Even after he was confined to a wheelchair, he was there at every tournament, to cheer them and encourage them and especially bring sweets to young players. To them he was “Malcolm uncle – Our Santa Claus.” To everyone one of us, he was a special person who had our interest at heart at all times. The Priest who officiated at his funeral, began his sermon this way: “Malcolm Andree got into a bus last Friday and the name board read ‘Heavan’ and I am sure he is already there. And I am positive that Malcolm is trying to get around god to form a netball team there is Heaven!"
We were the first Netball Association in Sri Lanka and Malcolm, I am sure, where we join you one day, we may be able to form the 1st Association in God's beautiful Home. Good bye Malcolm. You will always be a part of the Western Province Netball family. We will remember you with gratitude, always.

L. A. Gunasekera:
Loving mother and silent social worker
I write this on L. A. Gunasekera's fifth death anniversary which falls on November 10 with much feeling. Feelings of happiness for the beautiful memories we have of her. Feelings of sadness that she is no more to share life's joys and sorrows. We miss her but we know that she is free from pain.
We remember her as a loving mother, friend and silent social worker, with love and gratitude.
She hailed from a distinguished family from Matara. She was a lady per excellence. It could be said that there was a place in her magnanimous heart for everyone she came contact with. She was also respected by one and all for her sympathy, affection and compassion. She was also one who walked among the cream of society, but never lost the common touch. She was of a unique calibre. We loved her in life and we shall not forget her in death. Her passing away came as an irreparable loss to all.
She was married to Dublin de Silva, a businessman of Matara and had10 children. Her eldest son Ivan de Silva was the Permanent Secretary to the Ministry of Mahaweli Development in the previous government. I will be failing in my duty if I do not mention of Anura de Silva, her sister-in-law who looked after her as a Florence Nightingale during her long illness at her ancestral home at Kaburugamuwa in Matara.
May she attain the supreme bliss of Nirvana!
Five years ago
On this sad day
the one we loved was
called away.
God took her home
It was His will.
But in our hearts
She lives still.

On your birthday Brother
Treasured memories of Rohan Abhayaratna:
Your birthday was a few days ago but there were no calls wishing you.
No more birthday candles, only memories of a brother laid to rest.
Memories of our childhood the happy times
The good and the bad.
We had our moments like all brothers and sisters do
But we were there for each other right throughout
The end.
I thought of you today but that is nothing new
I thought of you yesterday and will tomorrow too.
I think of you in silence
And make no outward show
For what it meant to lose you
Only those who love you know.
Remembering you and all the impossible things you did is easy
I do it everyday
It is the heartache of losing you
That will never go away.
That is why this special message is sent to heaven above
For the angels to take care of you
And wish you a happy birthday and all our love
Happy Birthday Malli.
Sunila
