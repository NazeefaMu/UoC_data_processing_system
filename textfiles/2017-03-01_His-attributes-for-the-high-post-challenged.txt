His attributes for the high post challenged


	



 

The high posts committee of the Diyawanna council had asked a head of a certain government statutory body connected to marine transport to appear before it following a number of complaints that the latter did not possess even ‘the elementary qualifications’ for the post he was holding. 

 


Every time the head of the authority was asked to appear before the committee, the latter had been informed that the man was abroad.


This worthy had been playing truant thus emboldened by the fact that the statutory body he heads comes under the Ministry held by a family member, informed ones say. 


A long -looked for – day dawned for the JO members as well as the white collar high-ups of the statutory body who were mainly behind the complaints when the elusive head had recently appeared before the committee. The outcome of this decisive inquiry is due to be announced shortly, they say.
