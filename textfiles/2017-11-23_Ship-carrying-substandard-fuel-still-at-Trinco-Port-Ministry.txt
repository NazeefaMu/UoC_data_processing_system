The ship, which was rejected by the Lanka Indian Oil Company (LIOC) for carrying a stock of substandard fuel, is still docked at the Trincomalee Port, the Petroleum Resources Development Ministry said recently.

Commenting on this, Ports and Shipping Ministry Media Secretary M.P. Thameera Manju said, “The ship, still docked at the port, has no intention of taking the stock back. Minister Arjun Ranatunga too seconded this by saying the stock of substandard fuel would not be accepted.”

He said the LIOC had imported a shipment of fuel on October 15, but it had been rejected on October 17 after testing.

Speaking to Daily Mirror, LIOC Managing Director Shyam Bohra said they had nothing to do with the shipment, but the responsibility should be borne by the French multinational company M/s TOTAL that ordered the consignment. He said legal action would be taken against the supplier and that it could even get blacklisted.

While stating that he was unaware as to why the shipment was still docked at the port, Mr. Bohra suspected a delay in clearing documents led to this situation. (Chaturanga Pradeep)
