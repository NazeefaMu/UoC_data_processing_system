EU ban suspended for six months
	
	Fisheries State Minister Dilip Wedaarachchi said yesterday the European Unions ban on the export of fisheries products from Sri Lanka had been suspended for six months.
	The Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera visited the European Commission and discussed the issues with regard to the lifting the ban on exports of fisheries products, he said.
	This matter was discussed at the first cabinet meeting of the new government and the conditions laid down by the European Union are being gradually implemented.
	Agreements were signed last year during the tenure of former fisheries Minister Rajitha Senaratne to install satellite-guided Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) on all fishing vessels of Sri Lankan origin.
	The European Union gave Sri Lanka six months to get its act together to prevent Sri Lankan fishermen from engaging in Illegal fishing. The approval was granted for the installation of 3,000 VMS units, the Fisheries State Minister said.
	The foreign company which has been contracted to install the VMS equipment within six months on 1,500 fishing vessels has arrived in the country. The agreement was to be signed at the ministry office yesterday, but the minister had refrained from signing the agreement for reasons best known to him, he said.
	The state minister said the reason for not signing the agreement was not known and it would take another six months to find another company to proceed with the VMS installation.
	This particular company is well-recognized and the Cabinet approval has also been granted, he said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

India to help SL to trace billions stashed abroad
	
India will help Sri Lanka set up a finance intelligence unit (FIU)-like entity in the island nation at Colombo's request to trace more than $5 billion allegedly stashed overseas by the erstwhile Rajapaksa regime.
President Maithripala Sirisena is moving to fulfill electoral promises to check corruption and repatriate money allegedly siphoned off abroad by Mahinda Rajapaksa, who ruled Sri Lanka for a decade, and members of his family, government sources told ET.
The new Lankan regime has informally approached the Narendra Modi government to assist in setting up the body, sources said, adding that a formal proposal could be expected soon.
The finance ministry will share its best practices with Colombo to set up the unit, which could be modelled after the Indian body, the sources indicated.
"We could help close neighbour Sri Lanka with capacity building exercise regarding FIU," said an official familiar with the process.
India set up the FIU in November 2004 as a national agency to receive, process, analyse and disseminate information related to suspect financial transactions. It coordinates and strengthens efforts of national and international intelligence, investigation and enforcement agencies in pursuing global efforts against money laundering and related crimes, reporting directly to the finance minister. Last November, FIUIndia and its Australian counterpart decided to jointly crack down on international financial crimes.
India could also consider a formal proposal from Colombo seeking the Reserve Bank of India's expertise in tracing money allegedly hoarded in tax havens. The Sirisena government has also sought help from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund in locating this hidden wealth to expose the alleged corruption of the previous regime. The Sri Lankan government does not possess this expertise, according to Health Minister and cabinet spokesman Rajitha Senaratne.
Relations between New Delhi and Colombo have picked up pace less than a month after the change of guard in the island nation.
After the visit of Lankan Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera last month, his Indian counterpart Sushma Swaraj is scheduled to visit Colombo this month. The new President has chosen New Delhi as his first destination abroad and will be here in February. This will be followed by Modi's trip to Colombo in March - the first by an Indian PM on a stand-alone bilateral visit in 26 years.
Sirisena, who handed Rajapaksa a surprise defeat in the January 8 polls, has alleged that the former President and his immediate family had siphoned $5.38 billion from public coffers. Sources from Colombo told ET that high-level corruption was one the key reasons for Rajapaksa's rout. Several members of his family held ministerial positions or controlled state-run corporations.
Sri Lanka's economy expanded 7.3% to $67.1 billion in 2013, according to data on the World Bank website.
The new government has started reforming various government institutions, including regulators allegedly made defunct by the previous regime. Lanka's anti-corruption body has issued overseas travel bans on former central bank governor Nivard Cabraal and Sajin de Vass Gunawardena, a key Rajapaksa assistant, pending a corruption investigation.
Led by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremasinghe, the new Cabinet has appointed a high-powered "rapid response team" to look into corrupt land transactions, stock market price-fixing and the abuse of state funds for political purposes. According to Energy Minister Champika Ranawaka, a preliminary study by a local university showed the cost of new road construction in Sri Lanka in 2013 had been inflated by $1.53 billion. Rajapaksa was the minister in charge of highways, finance and ports. The government will review mega projects awarded to Chinese companies, including a $1.4-billion port city near Colombo harbour.(The Economic Times)

Removing Mohan, reinstating Shirani null and void: Sarath N
	
	Commenting on the controversial removal of Mohan Peiris from the post of Chief Justice and the reinstatement of Shirani Bandaranayake as CJ is null and void, former Chief Justice Sarath N Silva said yesterday.
	He said the proper procedure had not been followed even in the appointment of Ranil Wickremesinghe as Prime Minister.
	Mr. Silva said if each new government set aside the proper procedure on matters of a fundamental character then anarchy would prevail.
	Our supreme law is the Constitution; even the president has to uphold it and is subject to it. It upholds and separates the powers under Article 4. There is a special provision in the Constitution on the independence of the judiciary under Article 107 which provides for the appointment of the Chief Justice and the Judges of the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeal. They have to be appointed under the hand of the President. Removal too is in the same way, but under address to parliament and has to be preceded by an impeachment motion, then will proceed to 78A of the standing orders. There is a very clear procedure and we cant depart from it whatever our perceptions of the person however fit or unfit they are for the office, he said.
	Mr. Silva said Dr. Bandaranayake was appointed by the President there is no question about it.
	The Court of Appeal ruled that it must be decided on law and not on standing orders and the Supreme Court quite rightly overruled that on the basis that the Court of Appeal has no jurisdiction on parliamentary matters. Her removal was signed by more than 100 MPs, and though it may have had procedural flaws, it was an official act of parliament and the president receiving his mandate from parliament removed her. It is a valid removal and it stands thereafter whether we like it or not. That Chief Justice did not challenge her removal, nor did she contest the appointment of the new Chief Justice. The correct action was to bring a writ of quo warrantor and contest his holding the office, which she did not do, he said.
	Responding to questions about the involvement of the Bar Association in effecting the removal of the person holding the office of Chief Justice, Mr. Silva said there must be some limit on the involvement of the Bar in relation to such sensitive matters
	The Bar going up in arms does not validate the removal of the Chief Justice. Only a court can use the words null and void on the appointment and removal of judges. Moreover the Executive cannot use the words null and void because it is a matter to be decided by court, and as much as I greatly admire the new President even he cant say this is right. Upul Jayasuriya has reportedly said he was the one who drafted the impeachment motion against me which never went through, and I have nothing against him. But there must be a limit to the involvement of the Bar in impeaching the apex judicial figure. Warrant of the President comes under the public seal of the republic, and now you cant say its null and void because then what you are saying is that a sovereign act is null and void, Mr. Silva said.
	He said even Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was not properly appointed according to procedure as the former Prime Minister has to be removed according to the Constitution before appointing a new one.
	It is under the Constitution that the Prime Minister holds office unless hes removed by the President. He is the second citizen of the country and his appointment and removal must be specific. You cant appoint two Prime Ministers nor can you remove one by conduct. It is a simple matter of removal, and the Constitution under Article 81 says that notice of removal must be given in writing before the new Prime Minister is appointed and this was not done. Rule of Law and due process- we have lost track of that and embraced this basic misconception of Rule of Law. Even I have received criticisms for judgments I have made. If it is legally correct then it does not matter if it political or not, he said.(Jehan Gunasekara)

Efforts to free SL fishing vessels in India
	
	The Fisheries Ministry is making efforts to release Sri Lankan fishing vessels and other equipment, which are in the custody of Indian authorities.
	During a recent visit to India by UNP MP R. Yogarajan, he met its fisheries officials and discussed the release of Sri Lankan vessels detained by the Indian Coast Guard. The discussions resulted in agreements to exchange the fishing vessels between the two countries, the Fisheries State Minister Dilip Wedaarachchi said today.
	Mr. Yogarajan told Parliament about the views expressed by Indian fishing authorities while I expressed the views of the Fisheries Ministry at the sessions this week. A report will be handed over to the ministry secretary next week for President Maithripala Sirisenas approval, the State Minister said.
	He said India had in its custody 18 Sri Lankan fishing vessels, which together with their equipment, worth about Rs.15 million each.
	The fishing vessel owners are facing various difficulties because of the huge debt they are trapped in, the State Minister said.
	He said the previous Government had done little or nothing to obtain the release of the fishing vessels detained by India and that according to the reports received by the ministry there had been several attempts to rob these vessels and the equipment while several of them had been damaged by being left unattended or ignored for so long.
