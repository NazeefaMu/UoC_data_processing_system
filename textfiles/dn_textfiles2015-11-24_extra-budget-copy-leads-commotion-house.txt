Extra budget copy leads to commotion in House

Parliament sittings were suspended for half an hour yesterday due to a commotion created when the Opposition members demanded for an explanation on the copy of a budget speech that was placed on the members' desks in addition to the copy submitted last Friday.
When the sittings resumed, Leader of the House, Minister Lakshman Kiriella explained that there were no two budget speeches but one, and a copy of the same that was read by Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake had been placed on the members' desks.
"The Sinhala copy of the budget speech had been placed on the desks of the members on Friday sans three pages due to a flaw at the press," Minister Kiriella said. "But the minister read the full copy on Friday and the copy placed on the desks today is of the same speech the Finance Minister delivered on Friday. The English and Tamil copies had the complete speech," Kiriella said.
Minister Karunanayake apologising for the mistake at the press, said that at the wee hours on the budget day, there had been a mishap at the press and the Sinhala copy had three pages missing.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya suspended sittings at 10.30 a.m. and the sittings resumed at 11.00 a.m.
Following the round of questions for oral answers, Opposition member Dinesh Gunawardena said another printed copy of the budget speech has been placed on the members' desks.
"What is the difference between these two copies?" Gunawardena questioned. "The government has to explain."
At this stage, Kiriella said there was only one budget and the same copy was placed on the table.
"Then you have to explain the difference between the two copies," Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake said. "There is no need to give us two copies".
At this stage Minister Kiriella said that the opposition members have to point out if there are differences between the two copies.
"If there are two copies, there should be an explanation," the Speaker said. "The Leader of the House or the Finance Minister would explain it during the course of the day".
At this stage, Dissanayake said the budget debate is very important.
"But the minister and the deputy ministers are not in the House."
Minister Kiriella said the Finance Minister would explain the reason for the two copies tomorrow.
Gunawardena said if the government side does not explain, the opposition cannot debate on an unknown budget.
As the debate turned to a commotion, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya suspended the sittings for 10 minutes. The sittings suspended were at 10.30 a.m. and resumed at 11.00 a.m.
