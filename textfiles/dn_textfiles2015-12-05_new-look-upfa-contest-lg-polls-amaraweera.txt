New look UPFA to contest LG polls - Amaraweera

 
A new set of political parties will join hands with the UPFA to contest the forthcoming Local Government elections, Fisheries Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.
Addressing a press conference at the SLFP headquarters yesterday, the minister said among them were political parties representing Tamil and Muslim communities.
"President Maithripala Sirisena will lead the election campaign of the UPFA. The elections will be held under the ward system. Some in the UPFA claim they will contest separately. They are not a part of the UPFA in anyway," he said.
"One of them has challenged to relegate the SLFP to the fourth rank at the elections. If so, they must be having a secret understanding with the UNP. They prepared the ground for the defeat of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa by inciting racism. They did the same in the previous general elections. They must have taken up a contract of the UNP. They have a secret league with them," he said.
The minister said the UPFA would have a new look once the new groups are accommodated.
Responding to a question by a journalist, Amaraweera said former President Mahinda Rajapaksa would also help in the victory of the SLFP at the forthcoming elections as many local government representatives worked tirelessly for the campaign of Rajapaksa at the previous two elections.
He said the joint opposition may chose to take a different decision at the final vote of the Budget as many of their concerns have now been addressed.
Minister Amaraweera said the EU fish export ban would be withdrawn and that the GSP plus benefit would be regained by next year. "A EU team visited Sri Lanka recently to look into the lifting of ban. They stated that they would recommend to lift this ban as the country has reached the stipulated standards," he said.
