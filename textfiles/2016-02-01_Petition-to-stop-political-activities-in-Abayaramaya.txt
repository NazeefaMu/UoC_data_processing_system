Petition to stop political activities in Abayaramaya


	

The Ven. Pathberiye Vimalagnana Thera on Monday filed a petition in the Colombo District Court seeking an order restraining the Narahenpita Purana Abayaramaya being used for political, trade union and commercial activities.


Colombo District Court Judge T.D. Gunasekara ordered the defendant the Narahenpita Purana Abayaramaya Chief Incumbent the Ven. Muruththettuwe Ananda Thera to submit his response to the petition on February 15.


The petitioner states that due to the multipurpose political, trade union and commercial activities being carried out in the Abayaramaya Temple, the people have lost their faith, as it seriously violated the teachings of Buddhism.


The petitioner states that he had also filed another petition against the same defendant claiming his right to be the chief incumbent of the Narahenpita Abayaramaya Temple. (Shehan Chamika Silva)
