Gifts galore for his beloved!


	



 

A group of Diyawanna councilors from both sides of the divide went on a jaunt in the land of Uncle Sam recently. 

 


As usual, the group got a break from the pre-planned itinerary to go on a shopping round. 


While on the shopping round, the group members observed that a certain purohita – by the way, the one who recently modified his hairstyle - was spending more time than others on buying goodies, mostly women’s wares - garments, ornaments, hand bags etc.  They also noticed that in instances where he had to buy pieces of clothing like skirts and blouses, he would phone up someone to consult about the correct measurements. 


On seeing the purohita having a hectic time in the mall, one of his Diyawanna colleagues asked him: “For whom are you buying so many things amethithuma?”


“For whom else if not for my ones at home!” the purohita had replied and resumed picking goodies.
