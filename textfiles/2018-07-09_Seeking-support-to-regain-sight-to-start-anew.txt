Seeking support to regain sight to start anew


	

With a promising career ahead of him, Sanjaya Sandaruwan was at the prime of his youth, when at the age of 27 life took an unfavourable turn of events for him. Sandaruwan is a sad victim of an acid attack following a love affair he had with a girl in the neighbourhood; a relationship that cost Sandaruwan not only his looks but also his career and a bright future. 



A brutal acid attack was carried out against Sandaruwan in October 18, 2010 by his girlfriend’s family, who did not take the news of their affair kindly. 
Since then, Sandaruwan has been walking in and out of hospitals and clinics constantly, seeking a remedy for both his eyes that were left blind and almost beyond repair. Speaking to the Daily Mirror, Sandaruwan shared his sad plight, while seeking assistance to raise funds for the surgery on his left eye and find the capital much needed to start a small shop, which would immensely help him in the hunt to earn his daily bread and butter. 
“I had my first interview with the Daily Mirror back in 2014 to raise funds for the surgery on my right eye. Due to an acid attack that was brutally carried out against me, I completely lost sight in both eyes in 2010. 
“Since then, my life was completely shrouded in darkness for a period of five years. I had to go through numerous treatments including surgeries in the pursuit to regain my sight. However, I was not in a financially stable position to finance the major surgery that was recommended for my right eye. Following the initial interview I had with the Daily Mirror in 2014, I received donations from several generous donors which facilitated the surgery of an artificial cornea graft for my right eye. So far, this surgery is carried in Sri Lanka only by Senior Consultant Eye Surgeon (Cornea and Refractive Surgery) Dr Rajesh Fogla who hails from India and visits Lanka Hospitals once a month for consultations” Sandaruwan said.


Since it is an artificial cornea graft that was conducted, Sandaruwan has been strictly instructed by healthcare professionals to refrain from engaging in any activity or be present in an environment, which would make his eyes vulnerable to harm through dust particles and extreme heat. Currently, he has been prescribed six expensive medications for his eyes, that needs to be taken every two hours and throughout his life. These medications are important to ensure that the new retinas will not be rejected from the body in addition to keeping the eyes moist and help avoid the risk of infections. 
With an improvement of twenty percent in his right eye following a costly eye surgery medically known as the Boston Keratopersthesis Implantation Surgery’ that was conducted recently, Sandaruwan has rekindled his hope about gaining sight. Corneal transplantation also known as a corneal grafting is a surgical procedure, which helps replace a damaged or scarred cornea by a donated corneal tissue. 


Sandaruwan currently looks forward to having his left eye operated on with a similar artificial cornea graft, which would enable him to gain sight in his left eye too. Hence, this is a gentle appeal by Sandaruwan to generous donors to fund the surgery for his left eye. 
Since he is visually impaired to a certain scale, doctors have strictly advised him against being employed in any industrial or strenuous work. 
Though he worked previously as a coach for a sports club affiliated to a tourist hotel, Sandaruwan now finds it difficult to support himself and his parents with a similar job profile. However, refusing to be a burden any longer to the society, Sandaruwan has planned on focusing on a self employment venture that will not cause any risk to his eyes. 

 


"The estimated amount for the surgery on the left is valued at Rs. 520, 000; this is in addition to bearing the cost of Rs. 15,000 monthly for my daily medications and clinic routines"


 


With plans to open a small shop to financially support himself and his family, he appeals to the public for help once again to collect the capital that would be needed to open a small shop in addition to the public fund that he expects to raise to help carry out the surgery on his left eye. 
“I would like to thank all the generous donors who helped me in regaining my sight. I owe them tremendously for even the slight improvement I have gained in my right eye following the artificial corneal transplantation that was conducted on the eye. As I have been recommended the same surgery for my left eye and due to my financially unstable situation, I have no choice but to appeal to generous people once again to raise funds for both the surgery as well to find the capital that would be needed to open a small scale business of my own. 
The estimated amount for the surgery on the left is valued at Rs. 520,000; this is in addition to bearing the cost of Rs. 15,000 monthly for my daily medications and clinic routines,” Sandaruwan added.
Stating that currently a case has been filed against the accused in the Negombo Magistrate Court, Sandaruwan remains expectant that justice would be served to him. Donors who wish to help Sandaruwan overcome his sad plight could contact him on 071 2118745 or reach him at his home address located at No. 10, 5th Lane, Udasirigama, Lunuwila.
