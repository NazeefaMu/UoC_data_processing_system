TNA MP M. A. Sumanthiran said the prices of some essential goods have been reduced marginally and the budget looks good on paper.

“The budget looks good on paper but one wonders how realistic some proposals which were presented such as revenue collection, It seems that the trend continues on that aspect. No concrete measures for the rebuilding of livelihood for the war affected people other than housing schemes,” he said.
