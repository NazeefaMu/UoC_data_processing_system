Anura says Vijitha exemplary
	
JVP Propaganda Secretary Vijitha Herath had set an example by paying damages to Sri Lanka Telecom (SLT) for a telephone post, which was damaged when his vehicle knocked it down accidentally, party leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake said yesterday.
Mr. Heraths vehicle hit the pole while it swerved to avoid a collision with a pedestrian
Mr. Dissanayake told a media briefing that Mr. Herath had also paid Rs. 1500 as ordered by the Magistrate as a fine for his failure to avoid an accident.
Mr. Herath actually accepted this offence and had already paid the fine and thus set an example. He did not run away and did not influence the Police, which he could have easily done, he said.
However Mr. Dissanayake vehemently denied the allegation that the MP was drunk.
Mr. Herath was never drunk, though he was driving the vehicle. Those who actually drink every night had made this allegation as they think everyone else drink as they do, he added.
He said the Police never carried out any investigation to determine whether he was drunk.
He said the unfortunate incident happened while Mr. Herath was on his way home from the party head quarters in Pelawatte.
Mr. Herath was going to drop some essential food items at his home and then he was scheduled to go to Jaffna and it was he who informed the Police, Mr. Dissanayake added. (Yohan Perera and Dharashana Sanjeewa)

National Freedom Front (NFF) leader Wimal Weerawansa said today Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran had spent Rs.14.5 million for his personal expenses between February and December last year using the credit card issued by the central bank.

## Title: CIMA and Hackett Group launch Advanced Diploma in Global Business Services

CIMA and Hackett Group launch Advanced Diploma in Global Business Services
	
The Chartered Institute of Management Accountants (CIMA) and The Hackett Group, Inc. have announced the launch of the Advanced Diploma in Global Business Services (GBS). This is the second offering in their Certified GBS Professionals (CGBSP) programme, a comprehensive career development system for the GBS and Shared Services sector from CIMA and The Hackett Group. The Advanced Diploma in GBS (ADGBS) is designed for current GBS leaders and members of a GBS organisations senior management team. It is also relevant for senior executives who manage or work with GBS organisations, leadership at business process outsourcing companies and others.
The ADGBS is the highest qualification offered under the CGBSP programme and is designed to complement the other two certifications. The Certificate in GBS, which was launched last September, is designed for entry-level associates performing transactional or knowledge-based work. The Diploma in GBS, which will be launched this summer, is oriented towards mid-level managers or people preparing for the role of manager.
Each level of certification is driven by a comprehensive syllabus that teaches the skills and competencies required by employers to achieve the highest standards of excellence. At the foundation of the course materials are The Hackett Groups extensive knowledge of GBS and functional best practices, based on its benchmarking, advisory and transformation work with top global companies, combined with CIMAs intellectual content and long-term education expertise. The certification programmes are self-paced online learning tools that employees can complete over three to four months. Computer-based objective test exams are available in over 5,500 centres worldwide and are professionally invigilated to ensure the robustness of the assessment.
Participants in these programmes also have access to an online knowledge centre, offering access to material such as case studies, frameworks and performance metrics from The Hackett Group, CIMA and other organisations. The knowledge centre is designed to support participants through exams and life-long learning, with additional material unlocked as individuals complete certification at each level.
A new self-assessment tool has also been launched in support of the Certified GBS Professionals programme. The tool, which is available here (http://bit.ly/1X6kIMK), is designed to help organisations and professionals determine which of the certification programmes is best suited to their needs. With this second offering in our Certified GBS Professionals programme, weve chosen to address the needs of senior managers and leaders in GBS, largely in response to demand from the companies were already working with, said The Hackett Group Global Executive Advisory and Research Principal-in-Charge Sean Kracklauer.
Weve designed this entire programme to suit the full range of GBS professionals, complementing their functional training whether its in finance, IT, procurement, human resources or another area. Its a unique offering that combines CIMAs training expertise with the empirically-proven best practices and intellectual property only The Hackett Group can provide. The combination of training, testing, accreditation and a knowledge centre to help staff keep up with new developments and trends is unique and fills an unmet need across the GBS organisations we work with.
CIMA Education Executive Director Dr. Noel Tagoe said, The ADGBS is an important step in our partnership with The Hackett Group. This brand-new course and qualification fills a significant gap in GBS talent management and by using the latest technology absolutely fits the requirements of todays executives. Our Advanced Diploma will further help GBS organisations, their employees and suppliers to gain the right competencies and insight in order to reach their full potential.
The Hackett Groups research shows that world-class GBS organisations offer managers and staff nearly three times the training hours of typical companies. Professionals are offered nearly twice the training hours. Better talent management also drives an array of bottom-line benefits, including nearly 50 percent higher return on equity and higher net profit margins and EBITDA.
The research also shows that the GBS evolution is accelerating. The Hackett Group estimates that there are now over 6,000 GBS centres globally, with a total staff of more than 4.5 million. Nearly three quarters of all GBS organisations have moved beyond single-function centres, to establish multi-function centres. But less than 10 percent of all GBS organisations have completed the evolution to create fully integrated services environments with an end-to-end process orientation and a comprehensive service catalogue.
To coincide with the launch of the ADGBS qualification, The Hackett Group is making available for download on a complimentary basis, with registration, its most recent GBS research piece: The Evolution of GBS Organisational Designs: Design Choices Can Help GBS Leaders Reduce Friction, Tug-of-War over Resources by Competing Interests at http://bit.ly/1U8w5Tw.

The GCE Ordinary Level Examination will no longer be an exam which makes students pass or fail but an exam which merely promotes students to the next class in accordance with the new education system which this government intends to introduce, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said today.
The students will be able to move on to the next class after they sit for the ordinary level exam. But few subjects will be made compulsory for those who intend to enter university after the advanced level examination. Every student will remain in school after the ordinary level examination and move on to the next class, the Prime Minister said speaking at a ceremony held to mark the bi-centenary of Newstead Balika MV in Nogombo today.
He said it was part of the governments plan to reduce the burden of examinations on students.
The US which is the most powerful county in the world does not have any examinations in their education system. We too have to adopt a similar system, he said
While making a pledge to create a revolution in education, Mr. Wickremeisnghe - a one-time Education Minister said several changes will be introduced to the education system of the country within the next two years.
The Education Ministry will be responsible for determining the reasons as to why certain children dont attend school and provide a solution to it. Doctors will be made to visit the children frequently and treat them. Schools will be given the right to choose their own text books as it was in the past, he said. (Yohan Perera)

GMOA to take legal action against Chatura
	
The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) today said it would take legal actions against MP Chatura Senaratne over the derogatory remarks he made against the striking medical professionals.
GMOA Secretary Dr. Nalinda Herath told a media briefing that the GMOA would also complain to Speaker Karu Jayasuriya regarding the behaviour of MP Senaratne.
The future of Sri Lankan politics is visible from such incidents. Even the parents should pay attention to instill good values in their children despite their family status. As a father, Minister Rajitha Senaratne would also feel the same what I felt as a father. A child should know how to speak to a respected, knowledgeable person. MP Senaratnes statement has tarnished the GMOAs reputation, he added.
GMOA media spokesman Dr. Naveen de Soyza said the statement issued by MP Senaratne was a suppression made on a trade union.
Meanwhile, Dr. Herath stated they had obtained the approval of the central committee to take necessary steps if any misappropriation was included in the list of vacancies for assigning post-internships which was to be amended by the Health Ministry.
GMOA Assistant Secretary Dr. Samantha Ananda said the Health Ministry had agreed to amend the list after the discussion held with them on last Wednesday. Dr. Ananda also said the GMOA finally succeeded in their motive and that succession would result in the well-being of all Sri Lankans. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

Govt. saved country from pressure by Intl Community: Harsha
	
Though the 4 per cent increase in VAT has been severely criticised, the main object of the governments tax system was to increase direct taxes and reduce indirect taxes, Foreign Affairs Deputy Minister Harsha De Silva said today.
He said it was not the governments policy to continue with tax increases for longer than necessary.
Dr. De Silva said direct taxation amounted to 20 per cent and indirect taxation to 80 per cent and the government was planning to increase direct taxation up to 40 per cent by reducing the latter to 60 per cent.
The government admits that the VAT increase has affected the people. Before the increase, the government reduced the price of essential items and salaries were increased, the minister said.
Meanwhile, he said the previous government had failed to prevent the country from being affected by the influence of the international community.
If the country is not protected from the adverse pressure by the international community, the people would have been subjected to economic sanctions and even starvation without food and medicine. The present government was able to rescue the country on the nick of time and restore the status quo with the international community through negotiations, Dr. de Silva said.

## Title: HNB SME banking  Much more than just transactions

HNB SME banking  Much more than just transactions
	
The small medium enterprise (SME) sector plays a strategic role as a key driver of change in Sri Lanka for inclusive economic growth, regional and national development, employment generation and poverty alleviation.
This crucial segment forms a considerable part of the countrys economy, accounting for 80 percent of all businesses. In the manufacturing and service sectors, SMEs account for about 20 percent and 90 percent of business establishments, respectively. The SME sector, as a whole, is envisaged to contribute towards transforming lagging regions into emerging regions of prosperity. Hatton National bank (HNB) has a rich heritage as the partner that has helped countless millions of Sri Lankans progress and live better and enriched lives. Being a true Partner in Progress begins with understanding the needs of its customers. It goes way beyond providing financial assistance. We work very closely with our customers to understand their business, provide guidance and ultimately help them build profitable and sustainable businesses. We have to always stay committed to our customers and their needs. This is how we take a mere transaction and build entirely new relationships through it, said HNB SME Assistant General Manager Jude Fernando.
In this interview, Fernando discusses a gamut of issues encompassing this lifeline that helps grassroot level, small-time entrepreneurs to achieve sustained growth in the long term and emerging market developments and the banks singular contribution towards the growth of the sector. This is the crux of our new corporate communications campaign Banking Beyond Transactions, which epitomizes our philosophy of building relationships. It brings forth, how over the years, we as a bank have created innovative banking solutions through our unique understanding of this country and its peoples, he emphasized.
At HNB, in addition to its strong personal banking franchise, there are three main verticals that propagate the commercial business segment, i.e., the microfinance, SME and corporate banking segments. Microfinance clients gradually progress to SMEs and thereafter to mid and large corporates, where the opportunities are immense, depending on their success and long-term sustainability, he explained.
We identify people at grassroot level. What is unique at HNB is that we dont concentrate solely on financing established, ongoing businesses. We reach out to those down the line at the lowest level and give them the financial support and the required guidance to grow their enterprises and new ventures, he stressed.
This is where our team of highly experienced Gami Pubudu Upadeshakas (GPUs) and the regional SME cells play a significant role. These teams backed by our industry specific experts based in our head office and regional offices offer a unique and one of a kind service to our micro and SME clients. As far as I am aware, we are the only bank that has industry specialists be it in tea, paddy, rubber, spices, the leisure industry or manufacturing to help nurture and grow our client businesses, he further added.

What is the maximum finance under SME and what businesses come under the SME category
Under SME, we can go up to a maximum bank finance of Rs.200 million to any business enterprise coming under the agriculture, industry and services categories of the economy. Those who are in need of financing above this requirement are serviced through our mid market segment or corporate banking.
Tea, rubber and coconut come under the plantations category and businesses linked to these agro-based industries are also included, such as, tea factories, rubber, coconut and food and fruit processing plants. The fisheries industry is also a key area in the SME sector.
Further, industries manufacturing products for export as well as for import substitution and other manufacturing plants providing value additions to imported goods such as weaving and textile mills, spare parts producers form an integral part of the SME sector.
Services refer to any type of service industry such as information technology (IT), automobile services, garages, filling stations and professional bodies such as accountancy firms, service-oriented businesses such as hotels and restaurants. In addition, trading clients who do any form of import and export and local buying and selling are also included. 

How do SMEs reflect on employment generation
They account for more than 45 percent in terms of employment generation in the country, both direct and indirect. SMEs with value additions play a critical role. That is why the government has selected SMEs as one of the key sectors in its employment generation strategy.

What is the progress HNB has made in this sector
Our exposure in this segment is nearing Rs.200 billion and in 2015, the growth rate was 25 percent. We are a leading player in the SME space in terms of value and number of clients. We continue to focus on and grow this business and our expectation is to achieve 30 percent-35 percent growth this year.

What are your strengths and unique selling propositions to augment this segment
Firstly it is our comprehensive product offering backed by the convenience we offer through our state-of-the-art technology platforms. All our clients have access to e-banking and mobile banking solutions to carry out their banking from the convenience of their home or work place 24x7x365. Additionally they also have access to the very latest in payments and cash management solutions and distributor and supplier financing solutions at their fingertips. HNB also has the branch footprint amongst private banks to service the SME sector. Our 150-strong GPU field force working with our 250 branch managers and SME cell officers complete our offering which is beyond comparison to anything that is available today in the market. Our future aim is to make HNB the SME banker to the nation in the not too distant future.

What is the scenario in the North and East post-war
Post-war, most banks opened branches in the North, even in areas with a relatively small population. The immediate priority following the war was not to grant credit, but for people to settle down and to look after their basic needs. Today, there is a conducive environment in the North and East to do good business, especially more women have come together to embark on viable projects to improve livelihoods, thereby triggering enhanced economic activity.
People are now in a proper frame of mind to attend to their day-to-day work. They have formed societies among themselves and are engaged in various types of small businesses where there is great potential for improvement.
HNB has identified the skills of these innovative people and is paying special attention to harness their skills and tap the potential to uplift livelihoods through self-development.We cannot do our conventional banking as usual in the North and East in the absence of collateral. There has to be flexibility and need-based banking, which we have understood and are practicing now. Both our SME cells and field staff together with 46 branches in the North and East play a big role in supporting the aspirations of the people in these regions.

HNB continues to have a strong presence in the North and East
Many of our competitors moved to the North and East after the war, whereas HNB as a systemically important bank has been operating in these two provinces decades before. We were active in Jaffna, Vavuniya, Mannar and also in the East right throughout and after the war ended, we further expanded our presence. As a result, we have built a strong customer base and the HNB SME model is fully implemented in these areas.

Can you outline HNBs role in the SME sector
As a Sri Lankan bank, we go way beyond the provision of mere financial services. As explained above, our main focus is to partner SMEs and nurture and help them grow profitable and sustainable businesses that ultimately benefit not just the owners and employees but the country as a whole raising employment levels and growing our gross domestic product (GDP). We work not just with the experienced, but foster the start-up of entirely new businesses and industries from their inception. Most SMEs are not direct exporters, but they are suppliers of inputs to large exporters. As per information available, there are more than 5,000 exporters in Sri Lanka, but out of them around 25 percent are active. We must develop SMEs and assist them to become direct exporters. They need financial assistance, capacity and network building and technology improvement to take their businesses to the next level and access global markets.
We launched an islandwide programme to train SMEs to develop their entrepreneurial skills, financial management and marketing which, in turn, helps to improve their businesses. As most SMEs are proprietorships, they lack financial discipline which affects the decisions taken on running their businesses. We are also working closely with other corporates, FCCISL, EDB, regional chambers of commerce and GIZ to help SMEs in other aspects such as finding new markets for their products. One of the projects we are jointly working with GIZ & SLEMA is to improve awareness and knowledge in energy efficiency and renewable energy for SMEs in order to minimize the cost of production and build sustainable businesses. In addition, we work closely with our funding partners, such as DEG and Praparco who have generously contributed their funds to augment HNBs SME business. We will also be initiating a scheme to fund exporters based on their confirmed orders very soon. We finance distributors of renowned brands to enable them access low-cost funding on minimum collateral. This is done with the involvement and strength of the principal companies of these distributors.

What about technology
We understand that our clients operate in an ever changing, highly competitive global market place. Being fast and nimble is the order of the day. This is why technology and digitization is at the core of our offering. We have recently invested significantly in this area to bring convenience and state-of-the-art banking solutions that would drive productivity gains and the competitiveness of our clients in the respective industries they operate in. From the automation of payments including salary and supplier payments, to collection management and distributor and supplier financing solutions are all only a click away. Our newly upgraded Internet and mobile banking solutions ensure the ultimate convenience where all your banking, fund transfers, bill payments, etc., can be made 24x7x365 from the convenience of the customers home or office. These innovations that are on par or better than what is available in overseas markets help our clients compete not only locally but even across international markets.
Is there focus on start-up businesses
We pay special attention to start-ups especially focusing on youth who have acquired training but have no capital to invest in business. Also our strategy is to assist the country to develop priority sectors such as exports, dairy development, aqua culture and tourism.
HNB has remained very strong in refinancing schemes over the past three decades. The bank participate in different refinance credit lines where funds are disbursed in collaboration with the Government of Sri Lanka, Central Bank and foreign donor agencies which is a great means for start-ups/entrepreneurs to access low interest funding.
Our overarching objective is to make HNB, The SME Bank of the Nation and to foster and partner the progress of our SMEs in their drive to fully
realize their potential.

The CID had filed a facts report on June 1 naming the former magistrate as the fourth suspect in the inquiry in which three other persons -- Upali Padmasiri, Priyanka Sanjeewani and Chandraratne Yatawara -- were also named as suspects.
The CID in the B report stated the allegations against the suspect as abetment, conspiracy and cheating under sections, 102, 113, 398 and 400 of the Penal Code and section 5(3) of the Public Property Act.
However, on an earlier occasion the suspect's counsel had requested anticipatory bail over the incident in the Nugegoda Magistrate's Court, and the court had noticed the prosecution to appear in court yesterday to respond to it.
Following the presence in court of the former magistrate Gamage, the defence counsel recalled the anticipatory bail request.
Submitting the bail application, counsel Ali Sabri PC and Ajith Pathirana PC, who appeared for the suspect, said that according to amendment 22, 2009, to the Fauna and Flora Act, under the specific provision of section 21(3) (2) of the amendment, non-bailable offences relating to the Act should be considered in relation to the Bail Act.
However section 22A (12) of the Amendment says that an elephant without a licence can be regarded as an elephant which was taken illegally from the wild and therefore was public property. And it has special provisions under the Public Property Act when considering bail.
Counsel also held that even though the section 22A (12) of the Amendment, contradicts with the special provision, the specific provision shall take the precedence over the general law according the rule.
Counsel also said the Public Property Act cannot be related to the elephant of the suspect when considering bail for the suspect, since the suspect once had a valid licence from the seller, Chandraratne Yatawara, and should be regarded as a bona fide buyer.
However, Senior State Counsel, Dileepa Peiris, appearing for the Attorney Generals Department, told Court that the other suspect, Chandraratne Yatawara, from whom the former magistrate had bought the elephant, had been found by the CID in the Rikillagaskada area and he was the uncle of Ali Roshan, who is the main suspect in the elephant racket.
The state counsel said that apparently the seller of the elephant was not capable of maintaining an elephant.
He also said that the suspect Yatawara had now disappeared after giving statements to the CID and a magistrate regarding the incident.
The state counsel further stated that the special provision of the amendment, section 21(3)(2), applied only to offences that fell under the Fauna and Flora Act.The state counsel also said that the documents submitted to the Wild Life Department for the registration of the elephant contained false information.
Counsel also said the prosecution had not yet concluded its investigations and that there seemed to be a large scale elephant racket with fraudulent registrations.
He objected to bail as the offence fell under the Public Property Act and as the defence had not submitted any special circumstances in requesting bail.
However, the magistrate considering both parties submissions held that under the specific provision of section 21(3) (2) of the amendment of the Fauna and Flora Act, non bailable offences relating to the Act should be considered in relation with the Bail Act.
And he also said that the offences cannot be dealt with under the Public Property Act according to section 22A (12) of the amendment, since the suspect had obtained a licence for the elephant. (Shehan Chamika Silva)

Up to Rs.8.8mn when children turn 18 with ComBanks new Isuru minors savings plan
	
Parents can ensure their hard-earned savings for their children will grow into millions when the children turn 18 years of age, under the new Isuru minors savings plan unveiled by Commercial Bank of Ceylon PLC, Sri Lankas largest private bank.
New Isuru accounts, which are opened under this sixth permutation of the banks two decades old Isuru structured savings plan for children now pay up to Rs 8.8 million when the beneficiary turns 18, the bank said. A pioneer minors savings plan in the market, Commercial Banks Isuru offers two savings options  a monthly deposit scheme or a lump sum deposit scheme as per the choice of the parents or anyone who wishes to open an Isuru account for a child. The accumulated balance or the guaranteed amount when the Isuru lump sum deposit scheme matures (when the child turns 18) depends on the age of the child when the account is opened, while the guaranteed amount in the Isuru monthly savings scheme also depends on the agreed date of the monthly deposit, the agreed amount of the monthly deposit and the deposit period, in addition to the age of the child at the time of opening the account. Under the monthly deposit option, Isuru accounts may be opened for children who are between one day and 10 years old and parents may choose to save between Rs.500 and Rs.20,000 in multiples of Rs.500 a month, for five or 10 years. A 10-year savings plan opened at birth of the child with a monthly commitment of Rs.20,000 till age 10 will guarantee an account balance of Rs.8.8 million when the child turns 18.
The most compelling feature of the Commercial Bank Isuru minors savings plan is that the bank undertakes to pay the final guaranteed amount when the child turns 18, even in the event of the monthly deposits being interrupted due to the untimely demise of the depositor.
Parents who opt for the lump sum savings option may deposit between Rs.5,000 and Rs.1 million at any time between the day the child is born and the childs 10th birthday. A deposit of Rs.1 million at birth will guarantee the child a balance of more than Rs.5.7 million at the age of 18.
Isuru is a flexible plan that enables parents to save whatever they can afford, for the future of their children, Commercial Bank Deputy General Manager Marketing Hasrath Munasinghe said.
Since it is a long-term savings plan, the financial strength, stability and reputation of the bank are key considerations for parents. In these aspects Commercial Bank is already acknowledged as a leader in Sri Lanka.
Besides the Isuru minors savings plan, Commercial Bank also has the popular childrens savings account branded Arunalu, which rewards account holders for their
educational achievements.
