An upcountry political leader who is reportedly highly put out over loss of political authority has been told by astrologers that a Vastu Dosha of the building in which his political office is housed is the cause for the downswing in his political fortunes. 

 

 

 

Now this political leader is said to be planning to demolish his political office at Flower Road in the city with a view to putting up a 35-storied building on the site on the advice of Vastu Vidya experts from the neighboring country. 


The politico is said to have been assured by occultists that all malefic influences affecting him now will get nullified when the construction work on the new building gets underway at an auspicious time. Meanwhile, the politico looks forward to rake in a good income from giving on rent the floor space of the multi-story building due to come up. 


“The income from this building alone will suffice to meet all costs of running our party,” he has told his party faithfuls.
