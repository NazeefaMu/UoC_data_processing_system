Malinga refuses SLC Contract


	

Injured pacer Lasith Malinga had refused the Annual Cricket Contract offered to him by his employer - Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) for the 2016/2017 period.
 
Malinga, the world’s most feared limited over player with a sling arm action is recovering from a stress reaction in the knee.
 
Malinga suffered the injury during Sri Lanka's home series against the West Indies last November and has played only one competitive game since, missing the World Twenty20 in India as well.
 
“They (SLC) offered me a contract. But, since I have not played any cricket over a year, I said ‘NO’,” Malinga said in an interview with Daily Mirror.
 
“ But I am honoured to get a contract even when I am out of cricket for sometime. If I accept it, it’s unfair by others. Instead I told them to give me an opportunity to play.”
 
In August, Malinga hit the nets as he declared himself fit to play in the limited over series against Australia.
However, he was not selected for the series as the SLC doctors deemed him unfit to play.
 
Malinga now believes he could make a return to international cricket during the two-match T20 series against South Africa in January next year.
 
“I think I have recovered around 60 percent now. With over two months left for the series, I think I will be in good physical conditions to play in the T20 series. I don’t want to put too much pressure by playing in the 50-over matches at this stage. So, I will start with the T20s now and hopefully I will be ready for the Champions Trophy in England. I would love to be part of that tournament and give my best to the country,” he added.
 
Malinga was also critical of the selectors who included him for the World T20 Team despite the injury.
 
“ I don’t understand their thinking. When I said I am injured, they insisted I play and when I said I am fit, they didn’t select me. Any way I have played over 13 years for my country and I am immensely satisfied with what I have achieved during that period,” he added.
 
Malinga who is the first bowler since D. S. de Silva to lead the national side said that he expects more bowlers to be given the role of national captaincy.
 
“Bowlers are as good as anyone to lead the side. I proved it and now Rangana proved it. I hope we will have more bowling skippers in the future,” he concluded. (Sanath Desmond)
