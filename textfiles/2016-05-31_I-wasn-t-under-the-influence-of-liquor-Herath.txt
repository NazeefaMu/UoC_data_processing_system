While rejecting allegations that he was under the influence of liquor at the time of Monday’s accident in Rajagiriya, Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) MP Vijitha Herath said today he admitted committing a traffic offence by not avoiding an accident and driving carelessly.

He said he condemned the attempts by certain people to take undue advantage of the incident by alleging that he was under the influence of liquor at the time of the accident.

Mr. Herath said the double cab driven by him had crashed into a telephone post when he swerved the vehicle to avoid a pedestrian crossing the road.

He said neither him nor the pedestrian suffered injuries except for the telephone post was damaged.

“Certain websites and Facebook posts spreading false rumours alleged that I was drunk at the time of the accident. I reject these baseless allegations. I was produced before a doctor soon after the accident and the medical report proved that I was not drunk and even the police had confirmed that I was not drunk. I admit that I committed a traffic offence. But it is natural for anyone to commit such an offence while driving,” he said. (Ajith Siriwardana)
