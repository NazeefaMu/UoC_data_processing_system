Western Province Governor Hemakumara Nanayakkara said he had ordered Western Provincial Council Chief Secretary to cancel the purchase of 144 chairs, each costing Rs. 644,000, with immediate effect.

Addressing a press briefing in Rajagiriya, the Governor revealed that Rs. 644,000 for a chair was without the import duty and when included the tax, the price of a chair would be approximately Rs. 844,000.  

He said according to the investigation the original plan was to import 150 chairs and it has dropped down to 144 chairs.

“I asked from officials as to why they were going to order more chairs as WPC required only 104. They said there could be an increase of number of Provincial Councillors in the future. But according to my information the councillors would be reduced to 102 in the next election,” he said.

He said the new chairs were needed for the council, but purchase of chairs had to be either made in Sri Lanka or assembled in Sri Lanka at an acceptable price.

He said he would take relevant action in future if he got any reasonable complaint regarding abuse of power or misappropriation of funds in the Western Provincial Council.(Darshana Sanjeewa)
