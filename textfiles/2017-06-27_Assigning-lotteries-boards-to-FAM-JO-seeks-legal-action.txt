Assigning lotteries boards to FAM: JO seeks legal action


	

The joint opposition (JO) said today it would take legal action against the government decision to place the Development Lotteries Board (DLB) and the National Lotteries Board (NLB) under the purview of the Foreign Affairs Ministry by violating the Financial Act.

MP Bandula Gunawardena told a news conference that according to the Finance Act No.11 of 1963, it was the Finance Minister who was the minister authorized to regulate the NLB.

"Minister means the Minister to whom the subject or function of finance is assigned by the Prime Minister under Section 46 of the Ceylon (Constitution) Order in Council, 1946," he said quoting from the Act.

“We ask Foreign Affairs Minister Ravi Karunanayake whether it was legal for him to administer the lotteries boards which came under the Finance Ministry previously. The Act clearly mentions that the members of the lotteries boards should be appointed by the Finance Minister, not the Foreign Minister,” he said.

SLPP Chairman G.L. Peiris said not only was it a violation of the Financial Act it was also impractical. “What does the foreign ministry or its secretary knows about the lotteries? They have nothing to do with the lotteries board,” he said.

A special gazette notification was issued on June 9 assigning the Development Lotteries Board and the National Lotteries Board to the Foreign Affairs Ministry. (By Lahiru Pothmulla)
