The Supreme Court today directed the Controller of Immigration and Emigration not to take steps to arrest or deport Frontline Socialist Party Central Committee Member Kumar Gunaratnam.
The court made this order following a fundamental rights petition filed by Gunaratnam challenging the Controller of Immigration and Emigration against the alleged move to arrest him.
On Monday it was reported that the Department of Immigration and Emigration had sought the assistance of state intelligence services to locate Mr. Gunaratnam. The Department had alleged that his visa was expired ten days ago.
Earlier Gunaratnam was summoned twice by the Department of Immigration to record statements about his involvement in local politics.
