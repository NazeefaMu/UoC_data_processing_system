As the countdown slowly comes to an end and the runners put in their last rounds of practice, Reebok prepares to take center stage as the official running partner of the 18th LSR Marathon 2018. 

Introduced by Lanka Sportreizen and held for the first time at the Galle Fort in 1998, the LSR Marathon has become a much anticipated event in Sri Lanka’s sports calendar. Lanka Sportreizen is a member of the Association of International Marathon & Distance Races (AIMS). The Marathon is the only International Marathon in Sri Lanka registered with AIMS, the governing body for Long Distance Running at IAAF.

The marathon is scheduled to take place on the 7th of October, beginning at 6.00 am. The starting point will be located close to the BMICH. The first and second fun run finishes will be located at Orugodawatte and down Hekiththa Road respectively, while the half marathon finish will be within the Pamunugama town limits.  The finish line will be at the Negombo Beach Park, a total of 42 km from the starting point.
