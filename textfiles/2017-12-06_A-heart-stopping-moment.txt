A group of lions were jumping for joy after a young buck's attempt to leap over the pride ended miserably for the young dear. The charging buck came hurtling towards the group of lucky lions, who wasted no time in dragging the animal to the floor and sinking their teeth in. The buck can be seen struggling as the four lions hold down the animal, tearing it apart as they share the meal between them. The incident was witnessed in Nelspruit, South Africa.
