The CID today informed the Colombo Chief Magistrate that it had taken into custody another 13 elephants which were being reared without valid licences.

The detectives made the detection during investigations into forged elephant licenses and alterations made to the wild elephant registration book.

They told the Magistrate that they had sent the elephants recovered by them to the Udawalawe Transit Centre and were now under the custody of the Wildlife Department.

Several such elephants being reared without valid licenses were recovered last year.

Earlier, the main suspects in the elephant racket Niraj Roshan alias Ali Roshan and two others were released on bail by the Magistrate.

Following submissions made by the defense counsel seeking the Magistrate’s attention to the poor health condition of elephants in the custody of the Wildlife Department, the Magistrate directed the Wildlife Department Director General to submit a detailed report on the annual births, deaths and the number of elephants in Sri Lanka on the next date of the hearing.

The Magistrate also directed the Wildlife Department to permit owners to see their elephants at Udawalawe transit centre twice a week.

Defense counsel R.A.P. Ranawaka told Court that the Government, Attorney General’s Department and those involved in the alleged offence should come to a settlement, since the inquiry and the investigations were continuing for almost a year.

Considering the absence of the Senior State Counsel who was appearing on behalf of Attorney General, the Magistrate put off the case for March 30, 2016. (Shehan Chamika Silva)
