There wouldn’t be power cuts from today as the broken unit of the Noraichcholai Coal Power Plant had been repaired and was operational from this evening, Power and Energy Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said.

“We were hoping to bring back the Second Phase of the Power Plant operational, while adding 300 MW of electricity to the national grid by Thursday. Due to the hard work of the engineers the power generators could be made operational earlier than we thought,” the Minister said.

“We are on a mission to supply its full capacity of 900 MW after bringing back the other power generators back to operational as soon as possible,” he said.

“From today onwards there will be no any power cuts in the country,” he added. (Chaturnga Pradeep)
