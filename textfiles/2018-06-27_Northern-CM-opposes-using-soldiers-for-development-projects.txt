The government's decision to deploy army personnel to reconstruct abandoned tanks in Vavuniya was opposed by the Northern Province Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran and other Tamil MPs when this matter was discussed at Tuesday's Vavuniya District Development Committee meeting.

The meeting was presided by Industries and Commerce Minister Rishad Bathiudeen with the participation of Deputy Minister Kader Masthan, Mr. Wigneswaran, TNA MPs, provincial councillors, Vavuniya GA Somaratne Widanapathirana and security officials.

The minister said the government had approved Cabinet memo seeking the assistance of the army in the reconstruction of abandoned tanks in Vavuniya.

MP Sivashakthi Anandan said the army should not be used for this purpose as their duties were not relevant to this type of work and instead the assistance of the Rural Development Committees should be sought. This opinion was supported by the CM who said the army should not get involved in development activities.

But however the Sinhala Pradeshiya Sabah members objecting said using Rural Development Committee members could cause delays and commissions and bribes were bound to take place. They said by deploying the army the value for the money spent would increase and the work would be completed in double quick time. (Romesh Madushanka)
