The imperious lady is a source of humour for them!


	

The arrogant conduct of a tall lady holding secretarial status in a Diyawanna committee has become a source of good humour for the employees of the august assembly, they say.




If a khakied one on duty failed to salute her, she would bark at him, “I say, don’t you know what my position is?  You had better learn to pay due respect to your superiors!”


When she arrives for duty, a security guard is expected to open the door of her car and two of her subordinates should rush forward, for one to relieve her of a bundle of files and the other her handbag and she would walk ramrod straight to her office. And the employees would watch this familiar scene with derisive smiles, they say.
