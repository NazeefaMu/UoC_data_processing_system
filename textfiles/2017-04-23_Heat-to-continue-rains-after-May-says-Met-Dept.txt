Reduction of humidity in the Sri Lankan atmosphere and the strong solar energy hitting the surface would prolong the dry spell and the heat, till the end of the month, Department of Meteorology said today.

A Spokesman for the Department told the Daily Mirror that rains could be expected only after May 1, 2017.

The department therefore predicted a dry week and high speed winds in the North.

In addition sea areas were predicted to be rough from Kankesanthurai to Puttalam via Mannar and Pottuvil and up to the Hambantota area with winds reaching 60kmp/h.

Temperatures in some areas were fairly high and it rose to 37.7C in Trincomalee while it was 33C average in other areas.

Heat seemed to be a phenomenon in the Indian Ocean region with the Meteorological Department of India reporting that temperature in some parts of the sub-continent exceeding 40C. (Yohan Perera)
