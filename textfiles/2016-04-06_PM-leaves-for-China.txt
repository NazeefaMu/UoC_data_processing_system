Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe left for China on a three day official visit at this afternoon, officials said.

The Premier left for China with fifteen delegates including Foreign Affairs Minister Mangala Samaraweera by SriLankan Airlines flight UL 860 and will return on Sunday, April 10 night.

The PM is expected to hold discussions targeting Sri Lanka's investment opportunities with China.

Recently, on an upbeat note, Wickremesinghe’s Government cleared the stalled $1.4 billion Colombo Port City project, which had become an irritant in the ties between the two countries, after a change of Government in Sri Lanka. (T.K.G. Kapila)
