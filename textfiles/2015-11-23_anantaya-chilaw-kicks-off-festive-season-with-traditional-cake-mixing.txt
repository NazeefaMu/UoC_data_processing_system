Anantaya Resorts & Spa, Chilaw, part of Laugfs Leisure, kicked off the festive season in style with the traditional Christmas cake mixing ceremony, amidst much enthusiasm and merriment.
In the true spirit of Christmas, all guests, chefs and staff armed with aprons and chefs’ hats joined in the action, under the watchful eye of the Executive Chef. The age old ceremony of cake mixing commences well before Christmas and is said to usher in good tidings of joy and happiness.
“This ceremony is a great opportunity to share delightful memories with both guests and staff alike. For our staff, the hotel is a home away from home and it is important that the sense of family and togetherness is shared, especially in the festive season. For our guests too these simple moments are memories they would cherish on their stay with us,” Roshan R. Perera, CEO of Laugfs Leisure remarked.
Led by the Resident Manager, Dev George, the guests and staff gathered at the Resort restaurant where heaps of chopped and dried fruits, nuts and spices were laid out. Dozens of eager hands joined in as ingredients including cherries, plums, sweet ginger, orange peel, and cashews were mixed along with brandy, red wine and rum. The delicious aromas were a potent promise of the celebrations to come. The fruit was set aside in casks to mature before being used for the 200 kilos of cakes, puddings and other scrumptious delicacies to be made for the season.
