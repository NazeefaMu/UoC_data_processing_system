MYTH: 100 brush strokes a day can give you healthy hair    



BUSTED:  “This is definitely not true. We don’t recommend brushing your hair too often. Vigorous brushing can cause physical damage to the hair shaft, so it isn’t advisable. It can cause split ends and the hair is more likely to break, thus increasing the rate of breakage of the hair. Brushing your hair like this doesn’t make your hair shiny and full, you will only be reducing the quality of the hair,” explained Consultant Dermatologist  Dr. Nayani Madarasinghe.
