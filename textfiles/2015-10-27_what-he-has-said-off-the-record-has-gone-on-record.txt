What he has said off-the-record has gone on record


	


This Ministerial one the other day paid a visit to the Mattala airport to inspect the warehouse facility now turned into a paddy store. Print and electronic media teams were present on invitation to cover his visit.
After the inspection he addressed the media personnel: “What has happened should not have happened. This airport is a precious gift our government offered to the people in the South. Now that the damage is already done, they should pay us a monthly rental for using this airport storage facility.”
The Ministerial one changed his tune the moment the video cameras stopped whirring and flashlights were out. 
He was saying: “It should be obvious to anyone that this airport is an utter waste of public money. What a foolish thing to construct airports in backwoods like this!  Our former Lokka didn’t want to listen to sense!”
The Ministerial one’s off-the-record comment went on record as some of the video cameras were still running and he was blissfully unaware of it.
His double talk is about to be exposed soon. A certain TV station has planned to show this ‘unofficial’ part of the footage shortly, they say.
