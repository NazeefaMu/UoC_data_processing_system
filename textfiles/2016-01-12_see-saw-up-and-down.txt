See-saw up and down …


	

A new Diyawanna member had, the other day, come to the House along with a band of supporters from his constituency who were keen to listen to their member’s speech from the public gallery.
The supporters were too many for one elevator and they had to ride to the fourth floor in the two elevators meant for Diyawanna members. The Diyawanna member who reached the fourth floor with one group of supporters found that the other group was still at the ground floor. And they had gone down to the ground floor to inquire about the delay. However, once at the ground floor, they found that the other group had again gone up to the fourth floor. So they had ridden back to the fourth floor to find the other group had come down to the ground floor again. In this manner, both groups had ridden up and down several times, but they had failed to meet for a reunion on the fourth floor.
Finally the Diyawanna member and his group waited on the ground floor for the other group, and soon they were all together again! 
However, by now they had given up the idea of using the lift and taken the staircase together to reach the fourth floor.
