A security source said acting Assistant Undersecretary for Public Security Affairs in the Ministry of Interior Major General Ibrahim Al-Tarrah was notified about the activities of the suspect, and a team of detectives led by Colonel Nasser Al-Adwani was formed to pursue and bring the suspect to justice.
The suspect was placed under surveillance to confirm the report before the team raided the premises and recovered the contraband. She was referred with the items to relevant authorities.

Meanwhile, security operatives apprehended an Asian expatriate in possession of 28 bottles of local alcohol.

A security source said the Asian aroused suspicion of officers on a round of Hawalli after they spotted him behind an abandoned vehicle at a parking lot. He tried in vain to escape on foot when the officers approached him for checking but they traced and arrested him. He then told the officers he had kept 28 bottles of local brew inside the trunk of an abandoned vehicle. He confessed selling the contraband to clients in the area. He was referred to the area police station with the liquor. And, securitymen arrested a Kuwaiti citizen accompanied by an Arab national in Salmiya area under the influence of liquor.

The two men were standing in front of a grocery when the officers detected they were not in normal condition and approached them for checking. They were arrested for abusing alcohol and referred to the relevant authority. (Arab Times)
