Recognise Govt. prior to no-faith motion: Dinesh


	

The government representatives are reported to have told Speaker Karu Jayasuriya that they would agree to a no-confidence motion only if it could be taken up through the procedure stipulated in the Standing Orders.

Chief Government Whip Dinesh Gunawardane has told the party leaders meeting that the government should be recognized first and then a no-confidence motion should be brought in line with Standing Orders and parliamentary traditions.

He said once the motion is submitted, it should be placed on the Order Paper and the Business Committee of Parliament should decide on a date for the debate.

Mr. Gunawardane had pointed out the Speaker had not given a favourable reply to the government request. Government representatives were of the view that the no-confidence motion was a serious business that should not be rushed through.

Meanwhile, the government urged the Speaker to allow police to record statements from UNP MPs Palitha Thewarapperuma and Ranjan Ramanayake who were alleged to have smuggled knives into the Chamber during the ruckus on Thursday.
