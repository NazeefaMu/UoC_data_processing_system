The wife of a leading politico had recently bought a large estate for Rs.35 million. 

 


Soon after the transaction was clinched, the politico had showed up at the scene and had demanded a commission’ from the seller of the property. 


“Why a commission, Sir? It is none but your wife who bought the property!” the seller had protested. 
However, the politico had insisted that he be paid a percentage of the amount received saying, “You ought to know that money knows no kinships!”
