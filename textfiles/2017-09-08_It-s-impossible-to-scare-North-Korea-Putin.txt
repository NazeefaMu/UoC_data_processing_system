‘It’s impossible to scare’ North Korea: Putin


	

Vladivostok, Daily Mail), 7 September 2017 -  North Korea will never freeze its weapons programmes because it views them as its only means of self defence, according to Russian President Vladimir Putin.  


Speaking on Thursday, Putin said the administration of US President Donald Trump had indicated it wanted to defuse tensions over North Korea.  


His comments followed Washington’s demand of an oil embargo on Pyongyang and a freeze on the foreign assets of its leader Kim Jong-Un in a dramatic bid to force an end to the perilous nuclear stand-off, on Wednesday.  


However, Putin said whipping up military hysteria around the North Korean crisis was counterproductive, adding Pyongyang considered ending its nuclear and missile programmes as suicidal. It’s impossible to scare them,’ Putin said at an economic forum in the far eastern Russian city of Vladivostok.
