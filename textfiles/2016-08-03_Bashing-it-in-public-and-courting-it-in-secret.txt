Bashing it in public and courting it in secret


	

This prominent JO group member hailing from the upcountry rode high and mighty in the media scene during the previous regime. 



This worthy started his political career as a Green and later switched over to the Betel leaf which he felt was more politically congenial. When his political fortunes took a nose-dive after January 8, 2014, he made several overtures to the Green leadership which drew no positive response.  Resigned to his lot with the JO group, he jumped on the yahapalanaya-bashing bandwagon. 


This former purohita recently attended the funeral of the mother of a powerful purohita from the central hills. At this funeral he is said to have had a secret powwow with some top brass of yahapalanaya. 
It is an open secret now that this onetime media boss currently facing a series of court cases is rearing to team up with the yahapalanaya as a means of getting out of his present predicament.
