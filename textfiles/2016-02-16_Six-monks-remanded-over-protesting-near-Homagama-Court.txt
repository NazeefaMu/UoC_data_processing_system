Ravana Balaya convener, the Ven. Iththekande Saddhatissa Thera, five other monks and five lay persons (including a woman) were produced before Homagama Magistrate Ranga Dissanayaka yesterday and re-remanded on charges of disruption of court proceedings by their unruly behaviour on January 25.

The re-remanded suspects are Ravana Balaya convener, the Ven. Iththekande Saddhatissa Thera, former JHU MP and president of Sihala Ravaya, the Ven Akmeemana Dayaratne Thera, Sihala Ravaya secretary, the Ven Magalkande Saddhatissa Thera, the Ven Badalkumbure Ariyashantha Thera, the Ven Medirigiriye Punyasara Thera, the Ven Passara Pagnajothi Thera, Sumithra Malkanthi, K.S.Namal Shantha, M.A. Mahesh Prasanna, N.D. Senakumara, and S.M. Chinthaka Seneviratne.

These suspects had been taken into custody on three occasions and remanded on charges of unlawful assembly, trespassing into the courtroom, causing disruption to court proceedings, causing damage to state property and obstructing state officials in the pursuit of their official duties.

The magistrate, having considered the submissions, stated that if bail were granted to these suspects they would hasten to a microphone and challenge the court rulings, and thereby make a mockery of the entire judicial process. (Chaturanga Pradeep)
