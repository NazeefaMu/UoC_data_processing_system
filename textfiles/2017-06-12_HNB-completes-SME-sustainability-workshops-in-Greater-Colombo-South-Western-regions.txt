Continuing its pioneering efforts in the small-medium enterprise (SME) segment, Sri Lanka’s premier private sector commercial bank, HNB PLC, announced the completion of two workshops aimed at improving the financial literacy within 
the sector.
Part of a continuing programme to help empower SMEs from across the island by inculcating a spirit of entrepreneurship and providing specialized training into the practical and prudent management of such businesses, the bank’s most recent two workshops were conducted recently in the South Western and Greater Colombo regions under the theme: ‘Sustainable development empowering the small and medium enterprises’.
