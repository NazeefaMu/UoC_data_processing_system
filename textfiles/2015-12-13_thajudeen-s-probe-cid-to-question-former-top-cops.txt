The Criminal Investigation Department is to question former top police officials of Colombo this week that supervised the initial inquiries of the controversial death of former national ruggerite Wasim Thajudeen in 2012.
According to police sources the former Senior DIG in charge of the Western Province Anura Senanayake will be summoned to the CID office this week to be questioned over his involvement in the initial investigation of the ruggerite’s death.
The officers who were in charge of Narahenpita and Kirulapone Police Stations during the period of the suspicious death will also be summoned for investigations by the CID.
Police Spokesman ASP Ruwan Gunasekara said the CID will act on magisterial order to probe the former senior police officers who were in charge of the investigation of the ruggerite’s death in 2012.
The CID was ordered by the Colombo Magistrate on Thursday to probe whether there were any shortcomings of the previous police investigation and also whether the senior officials in charge of the investigation had deliberately omitted any vital points of the controversial death.
