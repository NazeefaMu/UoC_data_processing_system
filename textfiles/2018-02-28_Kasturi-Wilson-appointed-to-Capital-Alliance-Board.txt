Capital Alliance (CAL), one of Sri Lanka’s leading investment banks, has appointed Kasturi Wilson as a non-executive Director to their Board.

Wilson is the Managing Director of Hemas Pharmaceuticals and Hemas Logistics and Maritime Sector of Hemas Holdings PLC., and brings to the CAL Board a wealth of financial expertise and managerial excellence.

Wilson has an unparalleled track record of growing and transforming businesses, as evidenced from her time at Hemas Holdings. Having joined the group in 2002 as Finance Director of Hemtours (presently, Diethelm Travels), she was appointed as Head of Vishwa BPO, Hemas’s shared service unit, in 2005.  During her two-year stint there, she built a highly motivated business support team which streamlined transaction processing and SBU reporting across the group. From there, she went on to roles as Chief Process Officer of Hemas Holdings and as Managing Director of the Group’s transportation sector, and since April 2016 she has been the Managing Director of Hemas Pharmaceuticals, along with her role as Managing Director of Hemas Logistics and Maritime. 

“Kasturi’s financial acumen and ability to get things done, while being cognizant of the bigger picture and future needs of a company, have made her one of the strongest corporate leaders in Sri Lanka’s private sector today,” says Ajith Fernando, CEO of CAL. “These abilities and wide ranging experience will make Kasturi an invaluable member of our Board.”

Kasturi Wilson also brings to the CAL Board a strong streak of pursuing excellence and competitiveness, characteristics that were developed during her sporting career with the National Women’s Basketball team, which she captained in 1989. 

Wilson is also a Fellow of the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants, UK and a member of the sub-committee on Economic, Fiscal and Policy Planning of the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce.
