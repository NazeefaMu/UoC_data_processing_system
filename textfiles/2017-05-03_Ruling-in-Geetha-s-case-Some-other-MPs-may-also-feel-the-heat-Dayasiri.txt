Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekera said today the Court ruling unseating Geetha Kumarasinghe from her seat in Parliament could be a problem for several other MPs as well.

“This question can crop up for several others as well. This is an important verdict. This is the first time that such a verdict was given in Sri Lanka unseating an MP. This ruling may pose problems for several other MPs as well should an appeal in the Supreme Court results in the SC confirming the lower court ruling,” he told the weekly SLFP media briefing at the party headquarters.

UPFA General Secretary and Minister, Mahinda Amaraweera said this such a ruling was made possible under the 19th amendment which approved by the members of parliament. (Chaturanga Pradeep)
