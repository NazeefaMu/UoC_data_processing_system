DUBAI REUTERS May 27   - Iran’s hardline Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Saturday Saudi Arabia’s rulers faced “certain downfall” for aligning themselves with the United States, hours after the country’s pragmatist president called for improved ties with Gulf states.     “They (Saudi leaders) act cordially towards the enemies of Islam while having the opposite behaviour towards the Muslim people of Bahrain and Yemen,” Khamenei told a religious gathering, according to his Twitter account.
