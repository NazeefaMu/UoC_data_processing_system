The Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) Central Committee today declined to endorse a request by some SLFP members in the joint apposition to be recognizes as a separate entity in Parliament.

The party’s Central Committee met today to discuss a wide range of subjects pertaining to the party's future.

Party senior John Seneviratne said the SLFP MPs, sitting in the opposition, could criticize the government, but they would not be recognized as a separate group as long as they were members of the SLFP.

The joint opposition, mainly comprising MPs of the SLFP, has requested that they be recognised as a separate group in Parliament. The National Unity Government comprises the United National Party (UNP) and the SLFP though a faction of the SLFP loyal to former president Mahinda Rajapaksa is opposed to the government.
