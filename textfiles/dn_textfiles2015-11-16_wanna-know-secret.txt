Wanna know a secret?

‘Loveable’ should have been her middle name. Working with integrity, honesty and compassion Pooja Gauthami Umashankar embraces the best of what Sri Lanka and India has to offer.
She has proven her mettle in acting in Indian films like ‘Pori’, ‘Thagapansamy,’ ‘Thambi,’ ‘Pattiyal,’ ‘Githan,’ ‘Ula Ket Kume,’ ‘Jay Jay’ and ‘Altagasam’ and Sinhala movies like ‘Anjalika,’ ‘Aasai Mang Piyabanna,’ ‘Yahaluvo,’ ‘Suwanda Danuna Jeevithe’ and ‘Kusa Paba.’
Indian director Bala’s ‘Naan Kadavul’ set a new challenge for her. Her performance as a blind beggar won many accolades. Her latest film, Professor Sunil Ariyaratne’s ‘Paththini’ is slotted for release soon.
Q: You are more in Sri Lanka than in India now?
A: Yes, my granddad is 98 and I intend to spend as much time with him as possible. He is my most favourite person in this whole world! Love him to bits...
Q: Where do you like to go on vacation and what do you like to do?
A: I love Sri Lanka. It’s my home away from home and a vacation packed together. That’s never going to change. Vacation for me is being around people who enjoy life to the fullest. It is being around people who have hearts full of love and are full of laughter. So, everyday is a vacation because I surround myself with happy people.
Q: What was your worst subject in school and why did you dislike it?
A: I never liked maths. Guess it was because I never could understand it. LOL. Now that I think about it, I believe that if I liked the teacher teaching me the subject I am sure I would have loved it too as much as I loved history, civics, political science and law. I have had wonderful and amazing teachers teach me these beautiful subjects.
Q: What does marriage mean to you?
A: As a girl/woman I believe that who I want to marry is the single most important decision I make in my adult life. I need to ensure that I will be able to fulfill my duties as a wife to my fullest capacity.
I should be a blessing to my husband. We should become one in unity, in essence, in purpose and in mind.
I should be a comfort to him and I should rejoice in him, relish his love and cherish him dearly.
I should be able to defend him when the time arises and never take him for granted. Most importantly I should be able to respect him. All of this is not difficult at all as long as I find myself a righteous man because then he leads a blameless life.
I want a man who will love me. It is as simple as that. I need love in its truest and purest sense. I deserve it and anything less I reject.I am no longer engaged to Deepak Shanmuganathan. We broke off the engagement. That relationship as a husband and wife in the future would never work. So I decided to walk away while it was still possible. I do not endorse or subscribe to the concept of a divorce.
Q: If you were given an opportunity to spend a day with anyone on earth, who would you choose and why?
A: I wouldn’t change anything in my life at the moment. It’s perfect. God gives me the opportunity to meet wonderful people on a daily basis.
I learn and unlearn many things. The situations I am put through and the people that walk that path with me bless me and show me how gifted I am. I choose to spend my day with the very same people I come across on a daily basis.
Q: What irritates you most?
A: There are a load of things that can get to me. Here again I choose to let the positive in and keep the negative out. I choose on a minute basis to never let irritation get the better of me.
Q: What do you value most in a human being?
A: LOVE. That’s the answer to all problems, situations and conditions.
I believe each of us has within us a heart full of love that when used at its fullest potential has the power to heal, spread harmony, unite all and can achieve just about anything we put our minds to.
Q: What is your ideal combination of a meal?
A: I love home cooked food. I will never get tired of eating it. At home I am assured of a clean, healthy and tasty meal. It is a meal cooked with love. That’s the best combination I would say.
Q: What is the best acting tip that you can give to a newcomer?
A: Enjoy your work. Be honest to the character. Work hard. Dedication and sincerity needs to be put into your work. Discipline and time management is of utmost importance. Never compromise.
Give it your 100 percent. Work so hard until such time where you no longer have to introduce yourself. Trust me, it works like a miracle.
Q: What do you think is your weakest point and what is your strength?
A: My weakest point is that I trust whole heartedly and always give the benefit of the doubt to another. It has gotten me into loads of trouble. But I still continue to do so because my weakness is also a blessing to me. I am able to pick myself up after getting beaten to a pulp and bounce back into life like all is brand new. I believe that restoration in my mind and spirit comes from God. He doesn’t just repair my broken heart, spirit, body, soul and mind. He restores it to brand new and to an even better condition than it was in before. My biggest strength is God. When I have him with me I believe I need not look for anything or anyone else. He guides me and leads me. I happily follow.
Q: If you can do a role in a remake, which would you choose and why?
A: ‘Sound of Music’ or ‘My Fair Lady’. Even ‘Maine Pyar Kiya’ is up my alley. I love romance and the promise and hope it holds. I like doing these feel- good films.
I like the fact that these movies made me smile, laugh, dance, sing and cry and the works. LOL. As you can see I am a romantic fool!
Q: If you can travel back in time which moment would you like to relive?
A: I believe that my best is yet ahead of me. I have enjoyed every moment of my life till now.
But this is for sure. My best in life is yet to come. So I would like to look on forward instead of going back in time.
I would like to let memories be memories and look towards my future, towards achieving my goals and fulfilling my calling here on earth.
Q: One thing you would like to do before you die.
A: Spread as much love, joy, laughter, kindness, hope, patience, peace, gentleness, goodness, faithfulness, confidence, hugs, respect, self control etc.
Q: What are you up to these days?
A: I am waiting for the release of my new film ‘Paththini’.
Q: Three lesser known facts about yourself.
A: People think that I am a machine that smiles, laughs and plays all the time! They forget that I do get tired and I can run out of patience at times.
I cry when I get angry. I would give up my acting career if my husband wants me to do so.
