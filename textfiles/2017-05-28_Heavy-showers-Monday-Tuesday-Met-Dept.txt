The Meteorology Department issued a special weather report at 4.00 p.m. today warning showers or thundershowers would occur at times in the Western, Sabaragamuwa, Southern, Central and Northwestern provinces tomorrow and Tuesday.

It said a change in the prevailing weather condition can be expected with movement of the depression located in the Bay of Bengal towards Bangladesh.

“If the depression moved towards Bangladesh, rains will occur at times in the Southwestern parts of the country tomorrow and day after tomorrow,” it said.

Heavy falls above 100 mm can be expected at some places particularly in the Western slope of the central hills, it said.

The Department said the sea area off the coast extending from Puttalam to Trincomalee via Kankasanthure and sea area off the coast extending from Gall to Batticaloa via Hambantota can be rough.
