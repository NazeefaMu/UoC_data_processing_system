IUSF to launch massive campaign against Govt. inaction over SAITM


	

The Inter-University Federation would hold a massive campaign in Colombo against the Government’s failure to implement the promise to abolish Malabe Private Medical College (SAITM).

Convener of the Federation Lahiru Weerasekara said that the Government that ignored the election promises given in the General Elections and the Presidential election had now resorted to a series of election promises in a bid to win the Local Government elections.

“The Government had taken steps to privatise medical services, education and to implement a plan to sell State Owned Enterprises (SOE) and the forests to the private companies.

“Meanwhile the pension rights of the Government servants had been abolished under the pretext of a contributory pension scheme.

“However the Government failed to show any positive response to the public protests in this regard,” he said.

He said that they would intensify their campaign against SAITM and the Government’s attempt to give it recognition. (Kusal Chamath)
