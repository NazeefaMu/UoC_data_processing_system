In a facts report on the money laundering inquiry against Samantha Kumara alias ‘Wele Suda’ and seven others, the CID informed Court that Wele Suda had continued to speak to drug dealers through a mobile phone and was involved in drug trafficking while in the Welikada prison.


It sought court permission to record a statement of an inmate Suranga Sampath on the incident and informed Court that Wele Suda could be penalized under the 1979 Prevention of Terrorist Act for funding the LTTE.


The CID detectives said they were checking the bank documents of another person who was said to be involved in helping Wele Suda in money laundering and sought court orders to impose a travel ban on this man who lives in Ratmalana.


The Colombo Chief Magistrate acceded to the CID request and directed the Prison authorities to produce Wele Suda in Court.


The case was put off for June 10. (Shehan Chamika Silva)
