Steps to be taken to prevent accidents


	

Accidents have been recognized as the leading cause of the most numbers of hospitalizations in Sri Lanka. Accidents also account for so many deaths and lifelong disabilities. Millions of people meet with accidents ,  are hospitalized and receive treatment as in-house  patients each year. According to statistics,  the number of people affected by accidents annually is around four million. When data is carefully observed it is obvious that these accidents could have been prevented. Accidents are caused due to lack of attention.   People aged between15 to 44 are reported to be most vulnerable to death during accidents.  As many as 10,000 die each year due to accidents. Road accidents kill nearly 3000 while suicides (also falling in the category of accidents) take the lives of more than this number of people. Poisoning, drowning, animal bites, violence, and murders also claim thousands of lives.

Some people spend more than half their lives in total disability. Therefore, accidents affect everybody; including family, friends, and society. We must also consider the cost incurred and the time invested in treating patients. The seriousness of accidents is expected to reach new heights, during the next decade. This is due to the growth in industrialization, urbanization and rapid changes to lifestyles. In addition, a considerable amount of money is spent from the budget as  treatments on accident victims.   


According to Health Ministry data, the highest number of accidents are recorded through animal bites (33.1%) which is followed by falling (18.0%) and road accidents 15.9% . 1.8 % of all accidents happen due to poisoning.   


It has been revealed that the home has so much potential in terms of a place where accidents can happen.  42.5% of the accidents happen at home. The road has contributed to 27.3% of the accidents while the workplace contributes to  4.1% of the accidents. 2.7 % of the accidents happen at education institutes.   


The most number of accidents (24.9%) happen while people are travelling.  23.9% of the accidents take place while engaged in leisure activities.   When data is carefully observed it is evident that many accidents are preventable if the necessary attention is given. 


Ignorance, not following safety precautions, breaking laws, carelessness, lack of practice regarding first aid, shortcomings when transporting patients, unfavorable environmental conditions, defects in vehicles and other machines contribute towards accidents. Keeping people informed about what causes accidents will be extremely helpful.
