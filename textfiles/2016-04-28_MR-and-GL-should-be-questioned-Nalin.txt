Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and Professor G.L. Peiris should be questioned over the photograph, which was taken with former Sri Lankan Ambassador to Russia Udayanga Weeratunga during a recent Thailand visit, UNP MP Nalin Bandara Jayamaha said today.

“Udayanga Weeratunga is to be arrested and questioned over the alleged involvement in the death of Noel Ranaweera, a diplomatic officer attached to the Sri Lankan Embassy in Moscow, and the alleged weapon sales to Ukrainian separatist rebels,” he said.

“We urge the Government to record statements from the persons, who joined Mr. Rajapaksa on his recent Thailand tour,” the Minister said.

He said, Udayanga Weeratunga had evaded arrest for eight years.

“Mr. Rajapaksa and his tour members should know the whereabouts of Udayanga Weeratunga and all the details of with whom he associated,” he said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)
