Church of Ceylon says no to death penalty


	

The Church of Ceylon (Anglican Church) on Monday said it was against the death penalty and instead called on the government to vigorously combat drug smuggling and distribution at all levels in the society.

Issuing a statement, the Church of Ceylon said it cannot in any way agree with the move to resume the execution of those sentenced to death for drug related crimes and are yet continuing to be involved in the drug trade while in prison.

“As Christians, we believe that all people are made in the image of God and are therefore imbued with the spark of the divine within them, however obscured and hidden it may be. This is why the taking of human life is expressly condemned by the Church, whether by man or by the State. We believe the move has been rushed into without proper reflection in the backdrop of criticism and public disquiet about the spate of gang related murders and shootings in the recent days,” it said.

The statement said the engagement in criminal activities outside prison by convicted persons cannot take place without the connivance of prison authorities.

“The government cannot absolve itself from its duty to devise ways of minimizing such occurrences. It must take quick but well designed steps to put into place strong security measures in prisons. Obtaining the services of experts here and even abroad, if required. It cannot resort to hanging people to escape its own obligations,” it said.

The Church said their opposition to death penalty does not mean that it is unconcerned about the drug menace.

“We are indeed very deeply concerned by this widespread and very dangerous threat especially to the young people of our country and its consequences on wider society. We encourage our clergy and organizations to carry out awareness programmes and join with others in doing whatever we can to protect children. The church is willing to join and offer our assistance to the government in this regard in the educational sector,” it said.

“It is widely spoken including in government circles, that it is the ‘sprats’ who are being caught and punished while the ‘sharks’ are allowed to remain free to carry on their business, profitable to many, even politicians it is said. The law ought and must be applied in full force equally to all involved in this destructive trade,” the Church of Ceylon said.
