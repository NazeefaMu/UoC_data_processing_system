As the race for the presidential nominations hots up, reporters are also having to up their game.

It means they have to ignore distractions and anything that could put them off on live TV.

And for Hallie Jackson, not even a ball of snot could stop her reporting.

The NBC correspondent was on a live feed from Tennessee talking about Chris Christie backing Donald Trump when the booger started to come down from her nostril.

She didn't let it faze her, and she carried on speaking to the camera until it dropped to the floor.

Jackson didn't say if she knew it was there during her segment, but she saw the funnier side of it just hours later.

She tweeted a picture of her online shopping cart - $53 worth of tissues and a book called 'Surviving Your Season of Shame'.

The clip of her awkward moment has since gone viral. (dailymail)
