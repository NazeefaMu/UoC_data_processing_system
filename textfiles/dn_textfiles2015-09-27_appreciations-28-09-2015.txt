[APPRECIATIONS - (28-09-2015)]

A.B.A.C. Jiffrey :
He was ready to help others
Even today after 13 years since A.B.A.C. Jiffrey's demise, his existence is felt for many things he did.
At a time like this, a person of his calibre is highly needed to society.
Jiffrey improved his writing skills when he was a student at Zahira College, Colombo where he contributed many articles to the college magazine. He used to proudly mention that he was a student of the Dr. T.B. Jayah era.
Jiffrey was a prominent writer who had unique writing skills. He contributed to many leading newspapers, locally and internationally.
He was inspired by his maternal uncle A.I.L. Marikar who wrote several books. A.I.L Marikar's ancestry can be traced to Prince Jalaludeen of Armania. His father was A.B.L.I.L Marikar, the first reputed Ceylon Moor English book seller in Sri Lanka.
Jiffrey served as a member of the Board of Trustees of the Maradana Mosque, Colombo and was its Managing trustee till his demise. He was a very active member of the Moors Islamic Cultural Home since school days and was later appointed a Board member and held the position of several departmental committees as the chairman.
He was a long standing member of the All Ceylon Moors' Association and was also the Vice President. He also functioned as the Honorary Secretary of the International Islamic Institute.
Jiffrey was a simple and humble man who was always eager to help others through words of encouragement and advice. He is still remembered well for his kind heart and good deeds he did silently.

Hewa Nancy Fernando:
A gentle person with great sense of humour
September 25 marked the first death anniversary of Hewa Nancy Fernando of Wattala, former Vice Principal of Presbyterian Girls School, Colombo 8.
She was a practicing Buddhist and I remember her as a teacher who had a deep understanding of her religion. She was a vegetarian who despite a busy domestic schedule did not fail to meditate at least an hour everyday.
Nancy hailed from a reputed family. Retired Post Master H.E. Weeraratne was her father. She was the fourth in a family of six, three older brothers and two younger sisters.
She was educated at Ananda Balika Vidyalaya, Colombo 10 and passed the Senior School Certificate Examination in 1933. She started life as a teacher in 1935 at St. Mathew's College Dematagoda.
In 1945 she married Sonny Fernando, who was employed at the Cooperative Wholesale Establishment. They were blessed with three children Kamanitha, Kokilanee and Ananda who received the best of education, are now happily married and well placed in life.
Nancy was a very kind and gentle person of very high integrity with a great sense of humour. She was eloquent in both Sinhala and English. She was equally at ease with the rich as well as the poor. As a friend she reached out to help anybody who was in need.
She retired from the teaching profession in 1977 after serving for 42 years. The last post she held was that of Vice Principal of Presbyterian Girls School, Colombo 8.
Sri Dharmawickramaramaya, Meegahawatte, Peliyagoda was her second home. The temple lacked facilities as a result of which the resident monks faced hardships. She planned to develop the Viharaya and Dharmashalawa with fans, and a fully equipped washroom with pipe borne water. These improvements were carried out utilising her pension, without donations from others.
Her children have planned to erect a belfry in the temple premises in memory of their mother. It will be offered to the Sangha in due course.
May her sojourn in Samsara be brief and may she reach the supreme bliss of Nirvana!
