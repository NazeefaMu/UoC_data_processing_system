The Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) yesterday said that it appreciated Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne’s immediate and positive response to their reports of a shortage of Dextron 40, a drug used to treat dengue patients.

GMOA Media Spokesman Dr. Samantha Ananda told a news conference that Minister Senaratne had immediately agreed to import more Dextron 40 after the revelation made by the GMOA about the shortage of the drug in the country.

“During the last Disaster Management Committee meeting, where all the experts were present, the ministry’s Medical Supplies Division (MSD) director acknowledged that there was a shortage of the drug Dextron 40 in their stores.”

He said it was reported that the stock of Dextron 40 was sufficient only for three days, adding the Health Ministry should reveal to the public just how much Dextron 40 was available after the expiry of these three days.

Meanwhile, he said that it would be better if Minister Senaratne could have responded to other issues brought up by them in a similar manner.“It is necessary to show the same amount of concern for issues relating to the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) as well. Minister Senaratne should also look into the problems that have cropped up with regard to the transfer of doctors in State hospitals and to control tobacco consumption in the country,” he said.
