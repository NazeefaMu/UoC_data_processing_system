Prince Harry to honour Nelson Mandela's legacy

SOUTH AFRICA: Harry knows the country well from private and official visits and has personally been involved in shaping the programme that will also feature him learning about organisations helping vulnerable children.
Highlights of the trip include a visit to Kruger National Park, one of Africa's largest game reserves, where the prince will highlight anti-poaching efforts, while in Johannesburg he will meet Mandela's widow Graca Machel and visit a centre dedicated to the former world leader.
A Kensington Palace spokeswoman said: "Prince Harry was keen to focus on a number of key themes where he has been actively working for some time, and where he feels he can make a difference. "First of all, he was keen to understand some of the issues facing the hardest to reach young people in South Africa today and the positive ways they are being supported to overcome this. "He also wanted to support his brother's work in drawing attention to the ongoing critical conservation crisis, and the efforts being made on the ground by the highly skilled rangers.
"In addition he asked to highlight the recent history of South Africa.
His visit will come shortly before the second anniversary of President Mandela's passing on December 5, 2013, and provides an opportunity once again to reflect on the legacy of this great man and how it is inspiring South Africa's younger generations to take the country forward." - AFP
