Janashakthi Insurance recognised six students of the Wayamba University ‘Insurance and Valuation Degree’ batch for their outstanding performance at a special awards ceremony recently, where the batches of 2015 and 2016 were awarded Gold, Silver and Bronze medals along with cash prizes.
The specialised degree offered exclusively at the Wayamba University is powered by Janashakthi Insurance with the aim of promoting and fostering a generation of qualified insurance professionals for the industry. The partnership, which commenced in 2009, provides Janashakthi the opportunity to offer internships to students undertaking the degree, enabling them to gain invaluable hands-on experience within the industry. This empowers the candidates to become proficient and desirable recruitments for potential employees in advance of their graduation, giving them a head start to their careers in insurance.
“Janashakthi has always been passionate about empowering students to succeed in their education by providing them with opportunities from a young age, starting from the Janashakthi Shilpa Shakthi Grade 5 scholarship programme, followed by supporting their tertiary education via the Wayamba University specialised degree in Insurance and Valuation. 
As insurance solutions providers in Sri Lanka, we believe that we play a significant role in facilitating the right knowledge-sharing platforms for our future generations to gain sound insights into the world of insurance and acquire a specific set of skills. We extend our heartfelt congratulations to the students of the 2015 and 2016 batches and wish them nothing but the very best,” said Janashakthi Insurance PLC Chief Executive Officer Jude Fernando.
As a result of this programme, a high percentage of its graduates have progressed on to becoming highly desirable employees, who are offered job opportunities in the industry even before the final results are released. Several recipients of the Janashakthi Awards have advanced up the corporate ladder and acquired senior positions within the organisation as well as other insurance companies, helping propel the industry towards a secure and stable future.
The Wayamba University was the first and only university to offer a degree specializing in insurance in 2007. The course itself delves deep into the subject matter, imparting both theoretical and practical knowledge that are vital for aspiring insurance professionals.
“We are happy to have Janashakthi come on board to support us in this worthy endeavour. Their expertise and assistance have truly added value to our university students who are able to embark on successful careers in the industry. We have carefully structured the programme to ensure that all students gain a strong foundation in insurance, whilst helping to hone skills that will further complement their careers,” said Wayamba University Senior Lecturer 
V. Sanjeewa.
