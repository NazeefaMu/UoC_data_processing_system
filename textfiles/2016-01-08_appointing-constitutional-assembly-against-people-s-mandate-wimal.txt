National Freedom Front (NFF) Leader Wimal Weerawansa today alleged that the government was planning to introduce constitutional reforms which include the scraping of the unitary state and the priority given to Buddhism.
He said such a move would violate the current constitution, parliamentary tradition and the peoples’ mandate.
Mr. Weerawansa said at the presidential election,the government had pledged it would not amend any constitutional clauses,which had to be put to a referendum.
“The Government has broken its promise made to the people at the presidential election on upholding the unitary state and priority given to Buddhism. Minister Champika Ranawaka was very vociferous about these matters at the time but today he is nowhere to be seen or heard these days,” Mr. Weerawansa said.
He told a news conference that the government was also planning to convert parliament into a Constitutional Assembly instead of appointing a Parliamentary Select Committee (PSC) and said that this too was contrary to the people’s mandate. (Ajith Siriwardana)
