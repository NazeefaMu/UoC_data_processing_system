The Christmas tree which was constructed at the Galle Face grounds last year amidst much controversy has finally made it to the Guinness records as the world’s largest artificial Christmas tree.

The Guinness World Records said the largest artificial Christmas tree measures 72.1 m (236 ft 6.58 in) tall, and was achieved by Arjuna Ranatunga Social Services (Sri Lanka), in Colombo, Sri Lanka, on 24 December 2016.

“The Christmas tree was built as part of a three day carnival in the Galle Face Green in Colombo during the Christmas season as an attractive aspect of the event,” it said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
