Govt buys highest ever paddy stock

The government has purchased the highest paddy harvest so far - over 150,000 mt - spending Rs. 6,000 million during the current Yala season, Paddy Marketing Board (PMB) Chairman M. D. Dissanayake said.
He said the government expects to increase the quantity of paddy purchased from farmers upto 170,000 mt in this season.
"We hope to increase the allocated funds upto Rs. 8,500 million," he said. Dissanayake said the highest ever paddy harvest in the Yala season in Sri Lanka's history has been recorded this year.
"The government's paddy purchasing programme is being carried out successfully. The PMB is engaged in buying standard paddy produced by farmers despite efforts made by the Opposition to sabotage the programme by misleading farmers," he said.
