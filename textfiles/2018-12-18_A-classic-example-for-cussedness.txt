“A classic example for cussedness!”


	

The authorities of a major council distributed school bags among the school-going children of the employees at a ceremony held recently.




Employees of all departments of this institution had been invited to attend this ceremony along with their children. However, one divisional head of the institution had prevented the employees of his section to attend the ceremony saying that their children could get their bags from the left-overs after the ceremony.


This divisional head too had once when he was in a lower rank attended this annual ceremony to receive the school bags for his own children and he is no longer interested in this ceremony as his children are now grown up and are employed, they say.  


Referring to the uncharitable conduct of this divisional head, a colleague of his had quipped: “This is a classic example of cussedness!”
