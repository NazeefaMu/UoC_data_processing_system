Govt allocated Rs. 121 bn for education - Ravi
The Government has allocated more than Rs. 121 billion, much more than the previous year for recurrent expenditure for Education, said Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake in Parliament yesterday.
He also said that any member who was doubtful over the said allocation, could believe it when the money is utilized.
He made this observation yesterday, when the Opposition questioned him of the allocations made on education.
Opposition MP Bandula Gunawardena stated that the allocation made to a ministry is spent under two heads, adding the day to day expenses come under recurrent expenditure, while allocations made to development projects of a ministry comes under capital expenditure.
He said, everybody including those of the opposition commended the allocation as historic.
“The allocation for capital expenditure for 2015 was Rs. 17 billion, while the proposed allocation for 2016 is Rs. 18 billion,” Bandula Gunawardena said. But day to day expenses of the same ministry for 2015 was Rs. 44 billion, whereas it has been increased by Rs. 121 billion for 2016. It was said altogether the allocation is Rs. 145 billion for the recurrent expenditure.”
Opposition member Bandula Gunawardena stated that it is said in proposals Rs 124,883 million is allocated for provision of services, while the allocation for the same purpose last year was Rs. 2,994 million, “However there is no explanation as to how that money is to be spent,” Gunawardena said. At this stages, Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake stated that schools have around 11,000 buildings. But if we were to pay a rent for them, it comes to accounts. But these buildings do not come to accounts. The ADB, UF and World Bank has such a mechanism to include them in the accounts.
The Finance Minister stated that as an initiation in the Education Ministry and Health Ministry, those proprieties have been brought to the accounts. “They are clearly included in the appropriation accounts, the Finance Minister said. They should come into realistic accounts.
At this stage Anura Kumara Dissanayake stated that it was a novel estimation of properties of relevant ministries.
“However it is wrong to estimate and include them in expenditure heads and to say this much of money has been spent by the government during 2016,” Anura Dissanayake said.
At this stage, Opposition member Dinesh Gunawardena stated that this matter should be clarified at the party leaders’ meeting. He said if not they could not sign a blank cheque.
At this stage Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said the matter could be solved at the Party Leaders’ meeting.
