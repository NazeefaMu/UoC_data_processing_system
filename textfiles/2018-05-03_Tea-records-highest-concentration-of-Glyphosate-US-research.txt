Tea is among the agricultural products that record the highest concentration of Glyphosate, according to a latest research conducted by a top university in the United States.

The Department of Biology of Moroksy College of Health Professions and Sciences in the United States has published a research paper on its findings.

According to the paper, Glyphosate is the most widely applied herbicide in the world to eliminate broadleaf weeds and grasses that compete with crops. The paper said the highest concentration was found in four specific sample sources. They are tea bag, tea leaves, coffee power and honey.

“We observed elevated urinary glyphosate levels in participants who drank tea,” the paper said. (Kelum Bandara)
