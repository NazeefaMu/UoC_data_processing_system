A Storied Stay for Literary Lovers

One of my weird obsessions is Anthony Melchiorri's Hotel Impossible.
I love a good reality TV show (okay, and bad ones too), and this one, where Melchiorri goes into struggling hotels in order to find ways to make them better in a realistic and sustainable manner, pushes all my buttons.
He's not particularly nice, but at the end of the day, his hard work and effort and care about the hotel and its owners and guests shows.
It got me thinking about how great a book or library themed hotel would be, which led me down the path of looking up the different hotels around the world which feature books or literature in some capacity.
Turns out, there are quite a few.
Here's a round-up of some of the most interesting bookish hotels where you can spend a night or two.
Eloise at The Plaza
Fifth Avenue at Central Park South, New York, NY 10019
Speaking of Melchiorri, this fun Eloise-themed hotel was his creation. He was a young manager at The Plaza Hotel when a young girl came in asking where Eloise (based on the Eloise books) was, since in the story she lives on the top floor of The Plaza Hotel. He wondered why the hotel wasn't taking advantage of this opportunity to create magic and he spearheaded the creation of the Eloise tour for the hotel.
Those who take the Eloise tour at The Plaza can enjoy story time, watch their favorite Eloise clips, play dress up, enjoy tea, and more.
The Batman Room at The Eden Motel
No. 1685, Yucheng Road, Gushan District, Kaohsiung City, Taiwan 804
Ever wanted to stay the night in a Batman-themed hotel room? If you can get yourself to Taiwan, then you can live the dream. There's not only a thematic bed, but you will have the opportunity to soak in a Batman-themed tub, enjoy some bat cave walls, and watch some television on Batman-themed TVs.
Crime and Punishment Radisson Sonya Hotel
Liteyny Prospekt, 5/19, St. Petersburg, Russia, 191187
There is a boutique hotel in St. Petersburg, Russia, that's styled entirely after Fyodor Dostoyevsky's classic, Crime and Punishment. The hotel boasts that it "allude[s] to story's era and place, creating a sense of timelessness." The suites in this hotel feature Napoleonic decor, connecting to Raskolnikov's love for Napoleon, and standard rooms are filled with "rich accents and intricate Russian patterns" fitting with the book.
The Wizard Chambers at The Georgian House
35 - 39 St George's Drive, London SW1V 4DG
So who wouldn't want to stay in a Harry Potter-themed hotel room in London? The Wizard Chambers are gothic themed, with potion bottles and caldrons and the hotel itself is located just a skip and a jump from the official Harry Potter tour.
The Commons Hotel
615 Washington Ave SE, Minneapolis, MN 55414
From the outside and from the website itself, The Commons Hotel, which is located on the campus of the University of Minnesota, looks like your standard nicer-end hotel. But what makes this one worth noting is that there's a gorgeous library inside which invites guests to read and borrow books from its shelves.
And wait - not only is there a library here with classics and bestsellers, but there's a Book Butler on call who will deliver books to your room if you need something to read. Imagine getting both breakfast and books sent to your room for your stay? That sounds like a perfect reason never to leave your bed.
