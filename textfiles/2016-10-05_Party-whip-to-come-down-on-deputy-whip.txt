A deputy purohita who is also expected to wield a whip over the government side in the absence of his chief accompanied the chair of the Diyawanna council on an official visit to the land of Uncle Sam.

 

While this deputy purohita was on his official visit, the country’s Big Boss too arrived in that country to attend the UN general assembly sessions.

Meanwhile, the deputy purohita received an urgent call from the party headquarters asking him to rush back home to cover the duties of his chief in the council as the latter had gone abroad. However, the deputy paying no heed to the summons from his party quarters had accompanied the Big Boss to the UN general assembly sessions.

Another Green member from Galle area too had undertaken a foreign trip the same way without the approval of the party leadership. The party leadership has already decided to take deterrent disciplinary action against the two members, they say.
