Gazetting new regulations on ethanol imports run into a snag again


	


	The gazette notification providing for duty-free import of ethanol for the specific purpose of using it as a base for the manufacture of eau-de-cologne was about to be inked, when it ran into a snag again, they say.
The ‘relevant authorities’ have now  put on hold the gazette  notification carrying the  new regulations and  sent a report  to the government top brass challenging the  legal opinion  that has been proffered  okaying the  ethanol imports duty-free for the said purpose.
Meanwhile, Finance Ministry sources say two or three self-seeking legal advisers on financial affairs have become a bane of the new regime.
