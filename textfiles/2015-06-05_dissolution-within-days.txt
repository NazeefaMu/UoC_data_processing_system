Dissolution within days


	

Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said yesterday the no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was a futile exercise because President Maitripala Sirisena would dissolve Parliament within the next few days.
Commenting on the motion, the Minister told Daily Mirror the new government was formed after the Presidential Election to execute the 100-day programme and therefore, the United National Party (UNP), the main constituent in the ruling coalition was not in favour of the present parliament continuing in office.
He said in this context, the opposition's no-confidence motion was of no use.
"We are for the dissolution of parliament. Even the Speaker has also endorsed our view in this regard," Mr. Rajapakshe said.
He said the opposition was even unable to secure the support of a majority MPs to sign this motion.
"They were able to collect only 112 signatures. They have handed over the motion. But, it is for the government to decide whether it should be taken up for debate," he said. (KB)
