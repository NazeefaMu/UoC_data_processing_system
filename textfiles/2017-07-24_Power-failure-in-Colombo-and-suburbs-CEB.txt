The incidents of power failure reported in Colombo and the suburbs this evening was due to electricity load balancing to demand and not because of a breakdown, Power and Renewable Energy Ministry Director (Development) Sulakshana Jayawardena said.

He said the load balancing (peak demand reserve refers to the use of various techniques by electrical power stations to store excess electrical power during low demand periods for release as demand rises) had to be done to the grid due to the high demand of its use.

“From 6.30 p.m to 10.30 p.m, the system indicates the high demand of electricity usage of 2300 mega watts to 2400 megawatts. Due to the high demand, it had to be pushed up with more electricity to the system. Therefore for several hours some areas experienced an interruption in electricity supply,” Mr. Jayawardena said.

He said Maharagama, Nugegoda, Dehiwala, Rajagiriya, Matara and Kalutara were reported as the affected areas.

During electricity load balancing, one 150 megawatt power phase of the Kerawalapitiya power station and the AES Kelanitissa Power Station which was known as a privately owned facility of 168 MW diesel fuel fired combined cycle power station, had also malfunctioned.

However the workers took measures to restore the power supply in those areas. (Chaturanga Pradeep)
