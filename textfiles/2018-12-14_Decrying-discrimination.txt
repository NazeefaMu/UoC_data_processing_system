Decrying discrimination!


	



 

Arrangements made by the high-ups of a State Institution to provide official transport to the workforce to attend the funeral of the boss’s father from the morning hours had gone awry when the employees collectively objected to it.  

 


The high-ups of the institution had pressed the transport division staffers to provide official transport for the purpose from morning hours to win brownie points from the boss, but the employees had protested in one voice saying:   


“When an employee or a family member of an employee dies, only one vehicle is made available to the mourners in the afternoon to attend the funeral. The same practice should be applied in this instance too without discrimination!”  


Most executives who do not take the trouble to attend the funeral of a family member of an ordinary employee visited, in this instance the funeral parlour several times when the body was lying in state, employees say.
