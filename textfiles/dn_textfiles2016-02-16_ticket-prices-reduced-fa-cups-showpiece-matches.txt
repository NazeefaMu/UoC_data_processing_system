Ticket prices reduced for FA Cup's showpiece matches

 
London, Monday: The English Football Association on Monday responded to the growing controversy over ticket prices by reducing the cost of attending the FA Cup final and semi-finals.
The FA have decided to cut all ticket prices by £5 ($7, 6 euros), meaning the cost of attending the final at Wembley on May 21 will start at £45, excluding concessions, while entry prices for the two semi-finals at Wembley in April will begin at £30. A statement from the FA read: "Following discussions led by chief executive Martin Glenn, The FA today confirms that ticket prices for the 2016 Emirates FA Cup final at Wembley have been reduced by £5 across all price points."In addition, tickets for this year's semi-final matches revert back to 2014 prices.
"So far, this season's competition has seen attendances close to two million and £13m distributed to clubs across the football pyramid. "The FA is in a good financial position and lowering the cost of these showpiece matches is in recognition of the strong, continued commitment from fans supporting the world's original cup competition."
The subject of ticket prices has been much debated in recent weeks after Liverpool fans walked out of their draw with Sunderland earlier this month after 77 minutes, causing the club's owners to change their plans for a £77 match ticket from next season. AFP
