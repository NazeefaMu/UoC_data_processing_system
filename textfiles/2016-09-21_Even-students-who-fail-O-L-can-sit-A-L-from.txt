From 2018 onwards, even students who fail the GCE O/L examination will be given an opportunity to sit the GCE A/L, Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said today.

He told those gathered at a function held at the Education Ministry that students who sit the GCE O/L examination next year will be the first batch of students to benefit from this move.

The minister said the earlier requirement that students should obtain pass marks in Mathematics or obtain pass marks in the minimum number of subjects at the O/L examination would not to be mandatory when it came to sit the GCE A/L examination.

 “This decision will enable students admitted to grade 1 to continue through grade 13 without any hindrence,” he said.
