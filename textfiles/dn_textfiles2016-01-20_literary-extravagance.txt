DSC Prize for South Asian Literature

Address by Guest of honor Prof. Maithree Wickremasinghe for the awarding of the Fairway National Literary Awards:
"From the stylus on an Ola leaf to the pen on a manuscript to the typewriter on paper to the finger on a keyboard, you will agree with me that we live in the most prolific, the most proliferate and prodigal age of writing that the world has ever seen. When I say prolific I mean productive. The Huffington Post records over three million books having been published alone in 2010. When I say proliferate I mean the way in which today's writing multiplies and travels. Understanding of theories and ideas that travel from place to place, time to time and mind to mind but also quite simply in terms of copies and new editions and reproductions that journey mentally. Prodigal when one considers the abundance of overwriting that takes place especially on various social media and other cyber sites. Yet at no point in history has writing and reading been considered more democratic in the popular sense of the word, more representative or more independent or more egalitarian obviously thanks to contemporary technology or advancements and achievements.
Sri Lanka too has increased its hard literary output as any discerning book browser would tell you, especially in terms of self- publishing, translations of Sri Lankan books and children's books. In an age of such literary extravagance where there is no dearth in choice what should the critic look for in literature?
Creative writers, literary critics, fellow readers and friends. It gives me immense pleasure to be here at the inaugural Fairway National Literary Awards presentation for writing in Sinhala, Tamil and English. Fairway's inclusive and far sighted vision and commitment to promote Sri Lankan literature, stimulate an interest in Literature in all three languages needs commendation. It is also refreshing to note the generosity of Fairway which is essentially a commercial organization for their committed to the promotion of literature above corporate responsibility.
A literary award is a symbol of intrinsic quality and of literary standards. It is of Aesthetic value and of political, social, cultural and economic relevance. In today's context, I believe it is increasingly a touchstone in ethics. In other words a literary award is a symbol of excellence.
What should an astute critic look for in today's creative literature? Are there glimpses of originality in a novel? Are there critical insights into particular political, social, personal or ethical issues? Has the novel been adequately researched so it is not mundane or mediocre? Is there a skillful command, range, flow and polish in the language? Is there sheer brilliance in creative style and structure? Is there rich satire and irony?
When all has been read and said we can still go back to the traditional concern - the impact of a work of literature. What we in the discipline call 'effect theory'."
