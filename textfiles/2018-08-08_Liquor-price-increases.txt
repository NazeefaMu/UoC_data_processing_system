According to Inland Revenue Department website, the NBT exemption applicable on sale of liquor by the importer himself, was removed and made liable with effect from April 01, 2018.

Also, the exemption applicable to the imports of liquor and the turnover from the business of manufacture of liquor was removed and made liable to NBT.
