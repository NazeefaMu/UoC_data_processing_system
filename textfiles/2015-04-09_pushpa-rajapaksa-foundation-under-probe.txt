The Colombo Fort Magistrate today ordered the managers of two state banks and a private bank that the bank account details pertaining to the Pushpa Rajapaksa Foundation named after former Minister Basil Rajapaksa’s wife be handed over to the Police Financial Fraud Investigations Unit in connection with a financial fraud investigation.
The Police Financial Fraud Investigations Unit began investigations on the alleged deposit of 150,000 US Dollars in an account of an NGO named Pushpa Rajapaksa Foundation by providing false information. This amount allegedly belongs to the Sri Lanka Ports Authority.
Magistrate Priyantha Liyanage made this order sequent to a police request.  
Police submitted to Court that the Pushpa Rajapaksa Foundation had been registered as an NGO on November, 24 in 2010. This Unit informed the court that investigations were being made into the fraudulent withdrawal of the money from its account maintained in the Peoples Bank Headquarters Branch after crediting the said amount to this account.
 
Further investigations are being carried out to find out how the NGO received the money, how it was used and the activities done by the Organisation. (Lakmal Sooriyagoda)
