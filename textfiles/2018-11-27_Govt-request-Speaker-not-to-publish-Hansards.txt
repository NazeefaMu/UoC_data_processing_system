The government today requested Speaker Karu Jayasuriya not to publish the Hansards for parliament sessions held on November 14,15,16,19,21 and 23 claiming that the sessions were not held according to the Constitution, Standing Orders and Parliamentary tradition.

A letter signed by nine government MPs including Leader of the House Dinesh Gunawardane and Chief Government Whip S.B. Dissanayake has been handed over to the Speaker.

The other signatories were Nimal Siripala De Silva, Vasudeva Nanayakkara, Mahinda Amaraweera, Chamal Rajapaksa, Wimal Weerawansa, Udaya Gammanpila and Douglas Devananda.

They said in the letter that the Hansards for the above days could not be accepted and thus they should not be published. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)
