Election Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya said on Thursday the EC would seek a ruling from the Supreme Court on the measures on the measures to be taken to conduct the provincial council elections in 2020.

He said though political parties were levelling allegations against the EC for the delay in holding PC elections but that they were not responsible for the delay.

“The PC elections can be held after the finalisation of the delimitation process or under the previous electoral system or under the mixed system or under the new system,” the EC Chief said.

He said according to their assessment, the presidential election should be conducted before December 9, 2019.

“We can hold any election within a span of two months. General elections should be held in October, 2020. But, we also have to wait for the verdict of the Supreme Court with regard to the ongoing case,” the EC Chief said and added that all three elections - the presidential election, general elections and provincial council elections should be held in 2020.

He made these remarks to the media after a programme held in the Hambantota District Secretariat to raise awareness among government officers attached to election duties. (Sanath Gamage)
