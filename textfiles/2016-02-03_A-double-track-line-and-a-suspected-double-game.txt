A double track line and a suspected double game


	



 

It has been decided to lay a new double track railway line between two historic towns in Rajarata.

 


A certain yahapalanaya purohita is the livewire behind the project, they say. 


There is already a single track line connecting these two historic towns and the train services on this line are now restricted to only two or three runs up and down for a day. 


Technical experts who had done a feasibility study have reported that the proposed double-track line project would cost several billions of US dollars. Meanwhile, railway trade union leaders are up in arms saying that the proposed new project would push the department already incurring massive losses into worse financial straits. 


However, the politico is dead set on going ahead with the project for gaining political mileage.  And the trade union activists are now getting ready to tell the country what the motive behind the politico’s unusual interest about the double-track railway line project, they say.
