The government will look into the possibility of amending the budget proposal to increase traffic fines following a feedback study, Transport Minister Nimal Siripala De Silva said today.

Speaking during the committee stage debate on the budget, Mr De Silva said the government would monitor the effectiveness of the increased fines, especially to determine whether it will eventually reduce traffic offences and then decide whether to continue with it or not.

“The increase of fines was not aimed at generating funds but with the sole objective of reducing traffic offences which is on the rise,” the Minister said adding that the National Council on Road Safety together with the World Health Organization (WHO) had taken many steps to reduce road accidents.

In addition he said the government is planning to upgrade the public transport sector in the future. “ However one cannot expect to have low transport fares once the public transport system is increased,” he added. (Yohan Perera)
