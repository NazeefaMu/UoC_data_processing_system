Lady using her clout to boost family business


	

A powerful fair one who has become a law unto herself at a vital point connected to the country’s economy has been the topic of much hush-hush talk among the employees high and low at the place for some time. 

 


The lady said to be having the full weight of the political authority behind her, had been giving orders like mad to issue permits and allow concessions here and there and also to grant tax relief here and levy taxes there.  


The white collar high-ups who had been forced to carry out these arbitrary orders had decided that they should hit back by some means. And they provided all the dope on the lady to the Diyawanna member of Panchayudha fame and the latter unfolded the lady’s track record with great relish in the august assembly.  


Meanwhile, some enterprising opposition guys had made inquiries as to why the lady had taken an extraordinary interest in granting tax relief in respect of certain motor vehicle shipments. And they had discovered that importing motor vehicles is her family business. 


Meanwhile, a political wag asked: “After all, would there be a powerful person in a Banana state who would not use his or her political clout to boost the family business?”
