Introduce formula to increase salaries as well: JVP


	

The Government should introduce a formula to increase the salaries of Public and Private Sector employees every two months, in line with the fuel price increase, as people found it difficult to manage their salaries with the escalating Cost of Living, the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) said today.

JVP General Secretary Tilvin Silva told a news conference that the people were unaware of the formula to increase fuel prices and urged the Government to reveal it to the people.

He said the Government should reveal the reason behind the fuel price increase as the fuel prices had neither gone up in the world market nor the Government had introduced a new tax.

“Fuel prices in the world market had not gone up. Fluctuation in the prices by US$ cents cannot be considered a price increase. The Government is trying to justify the burden on people by hiding behind the formula on fuel prices. Fuel prices had gone up due to excessive taxes imposed by the Government,” he said.

He said prices of all commodities may go up again, including bus fares, transport costs, fishery and agricultural produce due to the fuel price increase.

“The Government has no clear economic policy. The country is engulfed in debt-trap again. The Government is selling State property rather than developing industries in the country,” he said.

Mr. Silva said the JVP had organized a protest campaign against the fuel price increase on July 16 and 17 throughout the country. (Ajith Siriwardana)
