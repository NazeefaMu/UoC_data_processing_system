Wijeyadasa doesn’t know what he is talking about: Ravi K


	

Replying to a statement made by the Minister of Justice Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe with regard to the access to temporary resident visas, Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake maintained that Minister Rajapakshe was misinformed and did not know what he was talking about.

Criticizing Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake’s statement that temporary resident visas would be issued to foreigners who invest a minimum of US$300,000, Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe had earlier made a comment that such a move only opens the door for beggars to enter the country.

He also alleged that Finance Minister Karunanayake had no business issuing such a statement without consulting the Cabinet. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
