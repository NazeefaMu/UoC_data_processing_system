Set up separate court to hear cases involving Buddhist Monks: Champika


	

A separate court, in consultation with the Mahanayake Theras of the relevant chapters, should be set up to hear court cases involving Buddhist monks, Jathika Hela Urumaya General Secretary Champika Ranawaka said.

He said this in response to a journalist at a news conference held today.

Mr. Ranawaka said the opinion of the Mahanayaka Theras should be sought with regard to cases involving Bhikkhus and that the Constitution had provisions to establish a separate court and as such it would be best to set up separate courts to hear court cases involving Buddhist monks.

“Buddhist monks have never asked for special privileges because the Buddha himself had said monks are subjected to the State law. However, the other cases too should be accelerated,” he said.

Mr. Ranawaka said the lawsuit on the D.A. Rajapaksa Memorial and Museum was postponed several times and the Avant-Garde case yet to be heard.

He said though the Court had sentenced Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) General Secretary the Ven. Galagodaatte Gnanasara Thera, it had failed to punish the criminals involved in Avant-Garde. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
