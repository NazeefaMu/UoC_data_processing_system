The Auditor General had replied to the Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) reaffirming his previous findings on the Central Bank bond issue, it is learnt.

He submitted a report earlier on the issue highlighting a loss of Rs.1.6 billion in the transaction. However, the report was disputed particularly by the government members. The Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) is conducting its own investigations into the alleged scam and had sought further clarification from the Auditor General in this regard. It is learnt that the Auditor General has sent his reply reconfirming his earlier observations.

In addition to the AG's observations, the individual members of the COPE will also submit their views on the report. (Kelum Bandara and Yohan Perera)
