	Frosts have appeared in several areas in the Nuwara Eliya District following temperature fell to 5.2 degrees Celsius this morning, the Metrology Department said.
	“The ground level temperature in several areas in Nuwara Eliya was down to 0.1 degrees in Celsius. Generally the country is in a lower temperature because the wind blows from North India, where it is cold weather season,” the duty meteorologist said.
	However, the frost might have a negative impact on crops, he said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)
