Assets Case: Court wants medical report on Duminda


	

Colombo Additional Magistrate Aruni Artygalle today directed the prison authorities to submit a medical report on Duminda Silva within two weeks.

He is facing charges of not having declared his assets and liabilities for three years.

The suspect was brought to Court in an ambulance and but not produced before the Magistrate after his counsel told Court that his client was unable leave the ambulance because he was critically ill.

After confirming that the suspect was in the Court premises, the Magistrate put off the three cases filed against him to January 26.

The Bribery Commission filed three separate cases against Mr. Silva under the Assets and Liabilities Act for not having declared his assets in 2010, 2011 and 2013.

The Bribery Commission named Parliament Deputy Secretary General P.M. Neil Parakrama and several others as witnesses. Senior counsel Anuja Premaratne appeared for the defence.

The Colombo High Court had sentenced him to death after being convicted for the murder of Bharatha Lakshman Premachandra. (Shehan Chamika Silva)
