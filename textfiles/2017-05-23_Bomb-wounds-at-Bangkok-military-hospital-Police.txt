BANGKOK AFP May22, 2017 -A small bomb struck a Bangkok military hospital on Monday wounding more than 20 people, police said, three years to the day since the army seized power of the politically unstable kingdom.   


 “From the initial report it was a bomb... there are more than 20 people injured,” Deputy National Police Chief General Srivara Rangsibrahmanakul told reporters.   


 “It was likely to be in a package,” Srivara said, adding that “battery and wires” were found at the scene.   


Local media said the device detonated in the hospital pharmacy, sparking panic and sending smoke into the corridors but caused only minor injuries.   


Police are already hunting suspects behind two other small blasts in recent weeks, but have given conflicting information over the devices and likely suspects.
