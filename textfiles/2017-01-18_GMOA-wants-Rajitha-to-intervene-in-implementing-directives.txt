The Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) today urged Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne to intervene in the implementation of the directives on annual transfers of government doctors.

GMOA Media Spokesman Dr. Samantha Ananda told a news conference that a certain director who had been removed from the transfer board was sabotaging the annual transfers of government doctors.

“The Health Minister had removed this individual from the transfer board some time ago. But as a result of his continuous intervention to this process, all annual transfers have being delayed for a long period of time,” Dr. Ananda said, adding that it was however questionable as to how this individual could act against the recommendations of the Health Minister.

“An inquiry is ongoing regarding this director over several issues. The annual transfers for government doctors have been continually disrupted since 2012 due to an administrative lapse. All government medical officers attached to the Health Ministry are subjected to the transfer system,” he said.

Dr. Ananda added that the GMOA would be forced to resort to trade union action if the authorities failed to resolve these serious concerns. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)
