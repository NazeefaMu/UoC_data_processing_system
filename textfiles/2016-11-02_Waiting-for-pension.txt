Disabled war veterans continued their protest for the third day today outside the Fort Railway Station demanding the government to fulfill its promise of providing their pensions with arrears. The initial protest, held on July 26, was called off following an assurance by Minister Duminda Dissanayake that their issues would be resolved within three months. (Pix by Nisal Baduge)
