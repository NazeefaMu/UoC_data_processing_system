A prominent politico from Wayamba has developed a sudden antipathy towards wildlife rangers, they say.

 


The politico of late is said to be going out of the way to be nasty to the wildlife protectors of all ranks.
He would find some excuse to lash out at the wildlife people at official confabs and other forums these days.


By the way, it has come to light that the wildlife ones had recently caught red-handed a buddy of this politico hunting game protected by law. On being caught, the buddy had mentioned the name of the politico, but the Rangers had ignored the pull and proceeded to prosecute him.


Meanwhile, a group of wildlife workers has decided to boycott in future any official discussion convened or to be attended by this politico, they say.
