	The detection was conducted as part of the Anti-Narcotics Month in existence on the instructions of Excise Commissioner General LKG Gunawardena, Deputy Commissioner Pushpakumara Silva and Assistant Commissioner Nimal Silva.
	The sleuths learnt that the restaurant was previously owned by a senior military personality who was renowned for his involvement in eliminating the LTTE menace in the final battle.
