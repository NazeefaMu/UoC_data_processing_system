An abnormal growth in a woman, weighting some 14-kilogrammes equivalent to the weight of four healthy newborn babies was yesterday removed by Obstetrician and Gynecologist Dr. Jagath Herath at a private hospital in Kalawewa.

The woman aged 35 from Kekirawa had been living for more than six months with the abnormal growth in her ovary, causing it to develop further, Dr. Herath who is attached to the Anuradhapura General Hospital told the Daily Mirror.

The length of the abnormal growth was 35cm and 25cm in width, Dr. Herath said.

The patient is currently receiving further treatment and her condition is said to be stable.

Unless the giant growth in her ovary was removed, such health situations could lead to cancers, the doctor said.

The two-hour surgery was completed with the assistance of an Anesthetist Dr. Kosala Dep, another senior doctor Lanka Chandra of the Anuradhapura General Hospital. ( Piyumi Fonseka and Dayaratna Embogama)
