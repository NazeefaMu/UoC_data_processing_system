Releasing a media statement the Minister said he was disappointed as a member of the SLFA about the incident.


“It is well known that holding a position in a private company while being a public servant is illegal. The elders around him are also to be blamed for this incident. He is someone who has a bright future not only as a public servant but also as a politician,” Dissanayake said.  


It was the responsibility of the police officers to ensure the investigations and court procedures were completed soon, the Minister said.
