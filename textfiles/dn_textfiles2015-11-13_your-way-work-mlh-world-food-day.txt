On your way to work with MLH on World Food Day

In celebration of World Food Day in October, Mount Lavinia Hotel distributed over 500 cups of herbal drink (kola kenda) to train commuters at the Mount Lavinia Railway Station. The delicious and nutritious herbal porridge, prepared under the supervision of MLH's own renown Chef Publis was offered to all those arriving and departing from the Mount Lavinia Railway Station as a breakfast drink to be consumed 'on their way to work'.

"The idea behind the project was to enliven a normal day of an average train commuter by offering this little treat. We realised that it was warmly welcomed by all as we saw the smiles on their faces," MLH Resident Manager Harinda Weerasinghe commented. "Breakfast is the most important meal of the day.

But unfortunately many of us do not make an effort to have a good meal in the morning. In most instances, we completely avoid it due to the rush we are in. Therefore, our cup of kola kenda on World Food Day would have even been the only breakfast to some who had it," he added.

The breakfast drink was distributed amongst a large group of commuters which included school children, public and private sector employees, vendors, parents and few tourists as well. The members of Team MLH were more than pleased to be part of the project which enabled them to give back to the society in a worthy and enjoyable manner.

Nurturing the neighbourhood and the surrounding environment is key do sustainable development for any organisation. As a leading establishment in the tourism and hospitality industry, MLH continues to undertake this responsibility and endeavours to extend the service to society as a whole.
