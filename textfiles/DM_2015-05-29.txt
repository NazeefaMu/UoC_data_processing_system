Dissolve Parliament immediately: UNP to Maithri
	
	The United National Party (UNP) the main constituent of the Yahapalanaya Government today strongly urged President Maithripala Sirisena to dissolve Parliament immediately and go for a general election.
	UNP General Secretary Kabir Hashim told a media briefing that holding a general election is a must in line with the mandate given by the people at the January 8 presidential election.
	We cannot hold office any longer as our time is up, Mr. Hashim said recalling that a mandate was given by the people to the present regime only to rule the country for 100 days. He said the present government had ruled for an extra 50 days despite the people's mandate.
	We strongly urge the president to dissolve Parliament, he said and highlighted the fact that this Parliament does not have a real mandate because it was the parliament of the former president.
	Responding to a question asked by the journalists as to what the UNP intends doing to get the House dissolved, Mr. Hashim said the first step would be to inform the people of the current political situation in the country.
	House Leader Lakshman Kiriella said the 20th Amendment was delaying the dissolution of Parliament said it was impossible to enact this piece of legislation because the parties had failed to reach a consensus.
	UNP too wants a change in the electoral system but it is not possible to implement it now, he said.
	Mr. Kiriella is a member of the cabinet sub committee appointed to work out the electoral reforms. (Yohan Perera)

India slams minister for rejecting fishermens proposal
	
Indian External Affairs Ministry in a statement, had called remarks by Fisheries Minister Mahinda Amaraweera not helpful to the governments efforts at finding a solution to the issue, The Hindu reported.
Minister Amaraweera had told The Hindu, We will not allow Indian fishermen to do fishing even for a single day in our waters.
In response to Indias proposal to allow Indian fishermen to fish for a few days each year, he told an agency, Not 65 days, we will not agree for even 65 hours and made it clear that the Sri Lankan navy would continue to arrest Indian fishermen if they were found in Sri Lankan waters.
The External Affairs Ministry spokesperson had said, We also have concerns about Sri Lankan fishermen fishing in Indian waters. Frequently, Sri Lankan fishermen are apprehended in our waters. However, we recognise that this is a complex livelihood issue, which has a humanitarian dimension.In this context, such remarks are not helpful.
The impasse between the two sides has grown in the past few months when Prime Minister Modi and President Sirisena had met and tasked the local fishermens associations with finding a solution to the decades-old problem of sovereignty in the waters. Sri Lanka contends that Indian fishermen use mechanised bottom trawlers that depletes fish population.
Earlier this month, the Sri Lankan Fishermen Federation took a unanimous position to ask the government to deny access to Indian fishermen, which would have an adverse impact on fishermen in Tamil Nadu who depend on the waters between the two countries for their livelihood.

Harins circular violates ethical guidelines-NFF
	
		 		 
		 
			
National Freedom Front (NFF) Parliamentarian Weerakumara Dissanayake yesterday charged that Uva Chief Minister Harin Fernando has issued a circular violating all administrative regulations, ethical guidelines and norms of good governance to enable his political supporters to engage in sand mining in the Mahiyangana constituency.
A circular issued by him on February 26, under the seal of the Uva Provincial Council instructs various state institutions officials to make arrangements to issue permits for sand mining, only to those recommended by Mahiyangana UNP organiser Upali Senaratne.
He alleged that Resident Project Manager of Mahaweli C Zone, Dehiattakandiya, Director Central Environment Authority, Badulla, Area Excavation Engineer, Geological Survey and Mines Bureau, Badulla, Zonal Manager, Sri Lanka Mahaweli Authority, Girandurukotte, Divisional Secretaries, Mahiyangana and Ridimaliyadda were directed to act against their conscious, ethos and administrative guidelines by the Uva CM.
Addressing a news briefing at the Opposition Leaders office, Mr. Dissanayake said he could not find a better example to explain the so called 'good governance' of the present government.
He said the circular under the title 'allocation of new sand mining spots' was an excellent document for any person in the Mahiyangana constituency to take legal action against Uva Chief Minister Mr. Fernando.( Sandun A. Jayesekera)

Lankan found guilty of stabbing Aussie neighbour
	
A Sri Lankan who fatally stabbed a fellow Lankan refugee in Australia has been found guilty of murder by an Adelaide jury, which earlier heard the crime was committed after the victim called his killer a "lady boy".
According to ABC online, Ketheshwaran Sivaperuman, 35, bled to death at his Elizabeth South home in January last year.
The Supreme Court previously heard he was stabbed with a large kitchen knife with such force the blade damaged his spine and exposed his intestine.
The jury unanimously convicted Mr. Sivaperuman's neighbour Satheeswaran Suppiah, 31, of murder.
Prosecutor Mark Norman said Suppiah hid the knife in his shorts, got into an argument with the victim and stabbed him. "On a hot day, after drinking hot liquor, his hot temper lead him to murder a man," he said.
"He was angry that the deceased had parked his car in the driveway, angry because the deceased had called him a 'lady boy'.
"All the evidence suggests the accused remained at the scene being hostile and aggressive towards the deceased, even after the fatal stabbing."
The court heard both men had previously lived together but the victim moved into a house on the opposite side of Griffiths Street after the pair had a falling out.
Mr. Norman said Suppiah repeatedly tried to blame another man for the death, telling police he only had the knife to cut apples.
Suppiah claimed another man grabbed his hand and forced the knife into the victim's stomach.
But Mr. Norman said all of the evidence suggested the other man was not even there and that Suppiah deliberately took the knife with him.
"The accused's account that he only had it with him for cutting apples or being playful is nonsense," he said.
His lawyer, Greg Mead, had earlier urged the jury not to convict him of murder.
"What sort of murderer is it who deliberately and intentionally inflicts a fatal stab wound and then immediately rings the police and ambulance and asks them to in fact save the victim, then hangs around in his own house across the road from the scene of the crime
Submissions on Suppiah's sentence will be heard in July.

	National Unity Front Leader and Central Provincial Councillor Asath Sally said he was given police security as he constantly criticized the opposition and that his life was in danger. There are several web sites that are against me, he said.
	Mulleriyawa- Kotikawatta Pradeshiya Sabha member Prasanna Solangaarachchis security officer also confirmed that he had been provided with special security.
	ASP Ruwan Gunasekara said police protection provided to a parliamentarian could be provided to a local government politician when requested.

Video: No-faith motion a ruse to block 20A - JHU
	
The Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) said today that the main purpose of attempting to force the dissolution of parliament through a no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, was to disrupt the enactment of the 20th Amendment to the Constitution.
JHU National Organiser Nishantha Sri Warnasinghe said the no-confidence motion must be brought against those who were attempting to block the 20A.
He said what was required today was not to push for the dissolution of parliament but instead to have in place a new electoral system.
Mr. Warnasinghe said the enactment of the 20A was being delayed despite the agreement reached on the changes and added that the reason for minority parties objecting to it should be revealed.
The smaller parties and the parties represent the minority communities agreed on the changes made to the 20A Draft Bill. But we dont know why they are repeatedly objecting to it by breaching the agreements, he said.
Mr. Warnasinghe said only the SLMC was against the 20A while the parties such as the JHU, JVP and TNA had assured their support.
We do not know why the SLMC is against this amendment. If they have any issues with it they should discuss them with the members of the panel which drafted it. It is unfortunate that the SLMC is acting in a despicable manner with regard to the 20A, he said. (Ajith Siriwardana)WATCH

## Title: No Glyphosate containers released as claimed: Ravi

No Glyphosate containers released as claimed: Ravi
	
The Glyphosate controversy has taken another twist with Finance Minister contradicting the statement made by acting Customs Director General R. Semasingha that 15 containers of Glyphosate had been released legally.
The minister said none of the containers had been released nor had it been banned in Sri Lanka but that 40 containers detained by Customs would be destroyed on a presidential decree.
President Maithripala Sirisena had banned the import of the highly harmful agro-chemical Glyphosate after studies had revealed that the use of this chemical had in a large way contributed to the spread of Chronic Kidney Diseases (CKD) in many parts of the country.
Commenting on the circumstances that led to the resignation of former Customs Chief Jagath Wijeweera, the minister said he had done so on his own over a personnel issue. There was no political influence that prompted his resignation as alleged by the opposition.
Responding to a journalist at the news briefing at his office, the minister said Glyphosate had not been banned in Sri Lanka as claimed by former Agricultural Minister Mahinda Yapa Abeywadana but the Customs had been instructed to destroy the 40 containers of Glyphosate on a directive issued by President Maithripala Sirisena.
However, Mr. Abeywardana said Glyphosate was banned in Sri Lanka in February, 2014 in six districts in the North-Central, Uva and Eastern Provinces in a bid to control CKD.
"There was a protest from the tea industry because Glyphosate is used as the main weedicide in tea plantations and the ban was active only in six districts," Mr. Abeywardana said.
Mr. Abeywardana also alleged that former Mr. Wijeweera had resigned because of political pressure to release 15 containers of Glyphosate. However, Mr. Wijeweera is still to deny the allegation if it was wrong. (SAJ)

Police to appael on Kotakethana case
	
In an apparent bid to defuse potential future public unrest, in the wake of Thursday's commotion in Kahawatte following the Colombo High Court verdict on the Kotakethana double murder suspects, police said it would file an appeal in the coming days.
Responding to a series of questions raised by journalists at today news briefing, Police Spokesman Ruwan Gunasekara said the police would discuss with the Attorney General to look at the possibility of making an appeal against the verdict.
The journalists said the polices inability to facilitate the case with sufficient and strong evidence had led to the judiciary to acquit the three suspects and they could not prove their alleged connection to the case beyond reasonable doubt.
They said an entire village was distressed by the series of events that took place earlier and the people continue to live in fear and Thursday's unrest was triggered by this agitation.
They questioned the rationale in using water cannon and riot squads to disperse these people who cried out of genuine fear.
The spokesman responded saying the investigators had done their best to support this case but since the scientific evidence did not tally, the judiciary had to acquit the suspects after a fair trial. (Kurulu Koojana Kariyakarawana and Sanath Desmond)

Political influence blocking corruption: JVP
	
Dont expect any more arrests of those alleged to have committed acts of corruption or any more political reforms from this government, the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) said on Thursday.
JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake who addressed a public seminar in Tangalle said no one else would be arrested because such arrests were being blocked by political interference.
He blamed the present situation on both the United National Party (UNP) and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP).
Mr. Dissanayake said there was political interference by the UNP because the party feels that it would be an advantageous position if the SLFP was be divided over the Rajapaksa clan turning out to be powerful while there is interference by the SLFP because President Maithripala Sirisena was keen not retain the support of his party members.
This is the present situation despite an assurance given to us by President Sirisena that he will not nominate any one facing corruption charges, he said.
Mr. Dissanayake said same thing was happening with regard to the controversial sale of Central Bank bonds which too would be swept under the carpet.
He said the country had come to a standstill with the only solution left was to hold a general election but this too was being delayed by the President for political reasons,. (YP)

Ex-CJ's son slams Namal
	
Shaveen Bandaranayake, son of former Chief Justice Shirani Bandaranayake questioned MP Namal Rajapaksas moral stand, asking Rajapaksa if he understood how he (Shaveen) 'felt when my family was condemn(ed), vilified and harassed during the past two and a half years'.
He said this in a response to a 'status' posted by Namal Rajapaksa on his official Facebook page, in which he pleads for his 'mother and brothers' to be 'left alone.
In a no holds barred response currently going viral, Shaveen asked how he would have felt when his parents were summoned to the Bribery Commission.
The former Chief Justice was impeached by the previous regime under controversial circumstances with what many alleged were trumped up charges brought against her in attempts to oust her.
The impeachment led to severe criticism against the then government both locally and internationally. However, the government maintained that the charges were proved and due process was followed.
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksas wife and Namals mother Shiranthi Rajapaksa had been summoned to the Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID) to record statements over various allegations of fraud and corruption.
In his Facebook post, Namal asked that political vengeance be stopped immediately.
"My Mother just received a notice to appear before the Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID). My Mother has always stayed away from politics. Does she deserve this harassment! Yahapalanaya seems just a facade for this government. Vengeance isn't "good governance." Targeting my Mother proves it. President Rajapaksa and I, as politicians, are always ready to face political vengeance. But I wish they would leave my Mother & brothers alone" Rajapaksa said in his status which was posted on the 26th of May.
Bandaranayake had responded the very next day, commenting right below the above status "Mr. Rajapaksa, you tend to forget those who you've left in your wake. My mother, father, aunt, uncle nor I were politicians. Yet, your government moved swiftly to condemn, vilify and harass us throughout the past 2 1/2 years. How must I have felt when my parents were called before the Bribery Commission How must I have felt seeing them being carted day after day to courts How must I have felt seeing them being defamed by the government media that you so eloquently manipulated during your rule Before you seek sympathy or support, 'audi alteram partem'. Youre an attorney, look that up" (Hafeel Farisz)

## Title: Bayliss can take England back to the top: Mahela

Bayliss can take England back to the top: Mahela
	
	Trevor Bayliss has been backed to help England return to the top of world cricket by one of the greatest players he has worked with.
	Mahela Jayawardene, the Sri Lankan batsman, captained his country for a spell during Baylisss four years as coach of Sri Lanka  and believes he has the qualities to revive England in all forms of the game.
	Bayliss, 52, is poised to become Englands first Australian coach with the Ashes just six weeks away. The last series between England and Australia ended in a 5-0 whitewash for the Aussies in 2013-14, but Jaywardene is confident Bayliss can rise to the challenge.
	He told Standard Sport: I am sure he knows what needs to be done and that he will give it a good try. It is a great time for him to take the job, because this is a young England side with a lot of talented players.
	Trevor is a good old-fashioned coach who likes to work behind the scenes. He doesnt like the limelight very much and just lets the players get on with it most of the time.
	I dont think it is a problem that he never had international playing experience. A lot of good coaches around the world are in the same position and you just need to look at Trevors record. He has been very consistent in all forms of the game.
	From what Jayawardene and others say, Bayliss will be Englands invisible man. Rarely will he be seen during matches, preferring to do his work on practice days and in the dressing room.
	Yet his unassuming demeanour masks a steely personality. Bayliss will not tolerate those who do not reach the standards of behaviour he sets, either on or off the field.
	If he sees something wrong he is very strict about it and will keep a firm line around the team, putting his foot down to make sure certain things do not happen, said Jayawardene, who is playing Twenty20 cricket for Sussex this summer after retiring from the international game earlier this year.
	He will give the team a clear game plan but then he will let them play. He will try to help the captain in his decision-making and is very sharp on tactics, although he is not a huge guy for the statistics.
	Baylisss approach to coaching is not, however, shaped simply by his cricketing experiences. In 2009 he was on the Sri Lanka team bus that was attacked by terrorists in Lahore, Pakistan. Paul Farbrace, Englands current coach who should become his No2 again, was also on the bus along with Jayawardene and the rest of the Sri Lankan players and staff. Six policemen and two civilians were killed in the attack, while Jayawardene was one of six players to suffer injuries.
	Jayawardene said: We all reflected on how lucky we were with the people we are close to, and Trevor is a good family man. Those values are important to him. That was a time when we all had to get together and get through it. Things go wrong in life and you need a coach who understands about players families and their lives outside cricket. You need to have a sense of perspective on those things.
	Like Jayawardene, Farbrace believes Bayliss dislikes attention. He said: He is not someone you will see a great deal. Its not all about him. He will not be sat out front. He works with players then encourages them to go out and play. Trevor is very knowledgeable with good experience and is also very calm. He doesnt say a great deal but when he does, people listen.
