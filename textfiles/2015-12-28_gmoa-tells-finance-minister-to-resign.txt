GMOA tells Finance Minister to resign


	

Government doctors today called for the resignation of Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayaka in the wake of even President Maithripala Sirisena reportedly saying that the budget proposals had placed the government in a difficult position.
Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) Dr. Naveen De Soyza told the media that when they met President Sirisena he had said the 2016 Budget had created unnecessary problems for the government.
“Citing one instance of arbitrary budget decisions by Mr. Karunanayaka, the President said he was not consulted when the emission test fee for motor vehicles was increased to Rs.5,000 or tax on electric cars being increased to Rs. 25,000 despite being the Environment Minister,” he said.
He hit out saying that Minister Karunanayaka must tender his resignation immediately as he was not fit to hold that portfolio after committing all these blunders and added that the changes and amendments made to the budget too numerous to count.
“If the GMOA was compelled to resort to trade union action by ignoring our demands, it will be decisive and indefinite. We will not step back as long as the government refuses to meet all our demands,” Dr. De Soyza said.
He said it appeared that the entire budget had been prepared only by Minister Karunanayaka and had not consulted even Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and that was why the President and Prime Minister had to intervene to change a majority of the proposals to minimize the damage and the public anger.
He said the GMOA smelt something fishy in the whole affair and it could be termed as an attempt to topple the government and alleged that if there was a conspiracy against the government, Finance Minister Karunanayaka must be the flag bearer. (Sandun A Jayasekera)
