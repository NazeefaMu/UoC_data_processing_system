President Maithripala Sirisena said yesterday the dreams to topple the government would remain as mere dreams, and that there would be no room to change the present administration.

“Someone is trying to topple the government. We will not let anyone change the government illegally or by violating the Constitution. A government change is only possible with the people’s majority in 2020,” the President said.

He said regardless of the political party elected, it was the responsibility of everyone who loved the country to allow the government perform its duties in a peaceful manner.

“There will be no room to work for power, greed and political benefits again,” the President further stressed.
