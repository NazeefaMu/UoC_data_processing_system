A Blue senior shares his wisdom with two younger ones
	
A yahapalanaya purohita from the Betel leaf party was having his lunch when two young deputies approached his table.
The young duo sat down and the senior purohita thought of putting a feeler to them. Addressing them, he said: Our party has come to this impasse because of the mistakes done by our former boss. Dont you think so, Malli He paused for a reply and added: He didnt take the trouble to correct those mistakes either 
Then one of the two young deputies opened up: What the former boss had said and done is no longer important, Sir. He is gone for one year now. Are things better off for us now Thats the question that should matter to us!
The next comment by the senior purohita indicated that his thoughts too were running on the same frequency.
He said: There wont be a comeback for us for a long time. I am not going to contest again Lost my seat twice. I may not get enough manape next time. But Malli, theres a future for you. He paused for effect and added: Get set from now itselfWe are going to have our own government in another  years!

He attended annual Pinkama, but not as chief patron
	
The former strongman had been conducting a year-end Pirith Pinkama in Kataragama for years in a row. However, when he recently contacted the relevant authorities in Kataragama in this regard, they had informed him that there was no possibility for him to conduct this event on December 31 night as usual.
When he received this unexpected message from the Kataragama authorities, the former boss had asked the messenger: Have they imposed a ban on my Pinkamas as well Or has the order come from some commission
The former boss later received the answer to his question from the official in charge of the responsibility of making arrangements for Pinkamas in Kataragama. I have got instructions to allow the former madam to conduct the Pirith Pinkama this time round, was his answer.
Nevertheless, the former strongman had attended the December 31 Pirith Pinkama in Kataragama saying that after all it was a Pinkama no matter under whose patronage it was to be conducted.
However, the former madam who was the chief patron of the event had not turned up for the event. The only VIPs present were three yahapalanaya purohitas, they say.

The former strongman the other day called a certain yahapalanaya purohita who is said to be playing the mediator role to bring about reconciliation between the present and the past heads of the Blue party.
When the purohita came on the line, the former strongman came to the subject straightway. You are talking about party unity, but you are berating us in the same breath. What are you really up to
The purohita, who was taken aback by the former strongmans rapid fire query, immediately protested his innocence. I never criticized you, Sir. On the contrary, I always asserted that 90 per cent of genuine Blues in this country are behind you
Do you mean that your present leader doesnt have a following the former strongman shot back.
He does have a following, replied the purohita. They make up about only percent. Most of them are minorities. In your case, Sir, you command the support of 90 per cent of the Blues. Our victory at the polls is a cinch when our present leaders votes are added to your support-base.
The former Boss greeted this reply with derisive laughter.
Why are you laughing, Sir the purohita protested. I told you the truth.
If that is the truth, go and tell your leaders who command hardly any support from the party membership to throw in their lot with me who has the solid support of 90 per cent of the Blues behind me. Do you want me to kowtow to your leaders despite my being a leader with a 90 per cent voter-base the former strongman asked. He rang off when he found no reply to his question was forthcoming from the other end.

	Live Events Ltd which organised the controversial Enrique Iglesias concert, and is facing an allegation of non-payment of entertainment taxes and are yet to produce the documents pertaining to the printing and sales of the tickets, had assured to provide all details to the Colombo Municipal Council within four days, sources close to Colombo Mayor A. J. M. Muzammil said yesterday.
	They said the company officials had given this assurance to the Mayor when they met him for a discussion last morning.
	According to them the Mayor had asked for all details pertaining to the number of tickets it had printed for the show and the number of tickets sold. The Mayor had actually told the company that negotiations had to be fair and that the company would have to make the outstanding payment without delay. Accordingly he had told the company officials to produce all details so that there wont be any room for default.
	It was reported that the Mayor had also told the company officials to hand over the details to Municipal Commissioner and the Treasurer.
	Sources said three directors of the company and a lawyer represented yesterdays discussions. (Yohan Perera)

Meddlesome fair member cost him his Ministry
	
The controversy over the defeating of the health ministry vote of the Western council continues to reverberate through political circles.
Even those in the highest echelons commanding the power to resolve it have reportedly washed their hands off saying: We did not bring pressure to bear on anyone even on the question of getting the annual Budget passed. So why should we intervene in a matter relating to the annual budget of a provincial council
By the way, a group of ruling party council members had been discussing the issue at an undisclosed venue the other day. During this discourse, practically everyone had blamed a fair member from the conch shell party for being responsible for the fiasco. One of the senior members in the group had said: 
Whenever we raised a question with that one regarding some matter were concerned about, this lady from the same party barged in and started shouting at us. How could we vote for that Ministry vote after getting that shabby treatment What happened was something they asked for
All others nodded their agreement.
This issue will remain unresolved as long as that interfering one is there waiting to get under our skin another member remarked.
There was general agreement to that suggestion too. The Chief Purohita taking over the Health Ministry is now part of history.

The chairman replied: The employee you are referring to is not qualified enough to be promoted to the high office you suggest.
The purohita was not prepared to take no as an answer to his request. However, the chairman quietly explained to the purohita that a government political authority had made the same request to his predecessor, but he did not comply because the employee concerned was not qualified for the post.
Your predecessor had to go home, because he didnt do what we wanted him to. You had better remember that the purohita angrily retorted.
The chairman who kept his cool replied: Honorable Minister, why dont you send me home the way my predecessor was sent I receive no emoluments for doing this job. I am rather tired too There are certain rules and regulations and procedures we have to observe. I am not prepared to violate them under any circumstances
The purohita angrily barked before hanging up: How can we build our party when people like you are there 
The purohitas spat with the corporation chairman has now become the topic of an animated discussion among the state sector trade union activists, they say.

Pakistan hopes for joint investment company
	
	Pakistan was investigating the possibility of setting up a joint investment company and a currency swap agreement with Sri Lanka, said visiting Pakistan Premier Nawaz Sharif yesterday.
	Speaking on Pakistan-Sri Lanka Relations, at an event organised by the Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute in Colombo, Sharif invited Sri Lankan investors and businessmen to invest in Pakistan and promised that Pakistans commercial and economic entities would carve out a smooth path for them.
	The Pakistan Trade Development Authority has organised a single country exhibition in Sri Lanka from January 15 to 17. I invite the Sri Lanka Export Development Board to organise a similar exhibition in Karachi -- or any other Pakistani city they like, he said.
	Earlier yesterday, the two governments signed a memorandum of understanding to include services and investment chapters in the FTA.
	Sri Lanka was in the exceptional position of having entered into a Free Trade Agreement with Pakistan, said Mr. Sharif.
	This would enable companies to form joint ventures for export to third countries. Given the strategic location of our countries, the service centres hold a lot of potential which needs to be exploited, he said.
	The present volume of trade between the two countries had not reached its full potential, he said, adding that President Sirisena during his visit to Pakistan had set a target of US$ one billion.
	Both countries have to work with the greatest resolve and commitment to realise this, he said.
	Speaking of Pakistans development since he was elected, he said exceptional economic policies had pushed the growth of the country.
	The development of the region depended heavily on cooperation between countries, and Sri Lanka held a key position in the Indian Ocean and had much to offer in maritime cooperation and the maintenance of peace and security in the ocean, he said.
	Pakistan desires enhanced cooperation in the maritime sector and increased security cooperation between the two armed forces, he said.
	He said Pakistan would continue to offer training to the Sri Lankan armed forces, the police and other institutions.
	Commenting on the wellbeing and the improvement of the South Asian region, he said countries in the region needed to engage in serious dialogue to stabilise themselves and to prosper.
	South Asian countries need to engage in dialogue to fill the gaps between them and to minimise divergence. My vision is a dispute-free region which has zero fighting, disease, malnourishment and poverty. We can overcome these issues with the creativity and the talent of our people. We also need to strengthen the trust between each other, he said.
	Mr. Sharif will visit Kandy today. (Nabeela Hussain and Lahiru Pothmulla)

Parking wardens for Colombo
	
Parking wardens have been deployed to 1,600 parking units in Colombo City for the next six months until parking meters are fixed in the city, the Colombo Municipality yesterday said.
Colombo Mayor A.J.M. Muzammil said wardens of a private company had been deployed at the slots along the Duplication Road and Galle Road.
Rs.10 will be charged from motorbikes per an hour, Rs. 20 from three-wheelers, Rs. 30 from vans and Rs. 50 will be charged from buses and lorries, the mayor said.
He said the wardens had been deployed only on a temporary basis until parking metres were established. The parking meters would be fixed within six months, he said.
Earlier the CMC said that parking meters would be fixed along the Duplication and Galle Roads and all by-roads connecting the two main roads to minimize traffic congestion and to put an end to errant parking.
Tender for the pilot project had been awarded to a private company, which would conduct the project for the first time in Sri Lanka.
Director (Traffics) Nihal Wickremaratne said the project, which was to install 125 parking meters along both roads was scheduled to begin in January.
It will take about six months for the project to be completed. Funds would be collected manually for several months before we rely completely on the meters, he said.
The new system would have facilities for motorists to pay by cash, card or other payment systems.
Forty percent of the income would be given to the Municipality, while the company would take the balance 60 percent, he said. (Darshana Sanjeewa)

Politico who wanted a postponement gets an earful
	
As the D-Day for the gentlemens game drew closer, the contenders from both sides were found engaged in a verbal duel each claiming victory as a certainty. The fact that there were powerful political figures backing both sides contributed in no small measure towards intensifying the heat of the battle.
Meanwhile, on the eve of the election, a certain politico had called on the new Big Boss and requested him to postpone the event.
The manner in which they are carrying out the battle is unjust - quite contrary to the spirit of the game. Therefore, Sir, please use your good offices to postpone the election and re-appoint an interim committee, he had implored.
However, the new Big Boss had angrily reacted to this request, because this politico was among those who were up in arms against the interim committee at that time and pressing for an election without further delay.
So an irate Big Boss had given the politico a tongue-lashing for about 10 minutes.
The new Big Boss had said: It was you and your friends who pressed for an early election. Now that we have taken action to hold the election, you come and tell me to postpone it. If you are sure of winning, why are you afraid of the ballot
After castigating the politico, the new Big Boss had told the purohita presiding over the game not to postpone the event for any reason.
The politico had beaten a hasty retreat with a long face

Postpone signing of agreement: GMOA
	
	The Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA), today, requested President Maithripala Sirisena to postpone the signing of the Indo-Sri Lanka Trade Agreement until a national policy on trade agreements was worked out.
	In a letter to him, the GMOA said that trade agreements should be drafted while maintaining the countrys identity and security, and that they should benefit the country and its citizens.
	GMOA general secretary Dr. Nalinda Herath said the shortcomings in an agreement had to be resolved through international arbitration, and these procedures were technically and legally very complex and difficult for a country like Sri Lanka to deal with.
	Resolving the shortcomings of an agreement will consume a massive amount of money. This was evident during the arbitration regarding the hedging agreement. The massive loss caused by the hedging agreement will have to be borne by generations to come, he said at a media briefing yesterday.
	He said that, therefore, they proposed that there should be a national policy on the formulation of trade agreements and that the Indo-Sri Lanka Trade Agreement should not be signed until a such a policy was formulated.
	Dr. Herath said the proposed agreement would cause more harm to Sri Lanka than the existing Free Trade Agreement (FTA) between the two countries.
	The existing Indo-Sri Lanka FTA has not benefited Sri Lanka. Those who drafted this agreement have failed to pay attention to the needs and responsibilities of Sri Lanka and the burden is now upon its citizens, he said.
	He said they were not convinced of the supposed advantages of the proposed agreement and that there was no transparency in the drafting of the agreement.
	However, he thanked Minister Malik Samarawickrama for providing them with information regarding the proposed agreement. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

	The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) said yesterday a draft constitution prepared by the Constitutional Assembly should be first placed before the people so that they could comment on the proposals before proceeding with a referendum.
	JVP Propaganda Secretary and MP Vijitha Herath told a media briefing held at party headquarters in Battaramulla that requesting people to submit their own proposals for the new Constitution would be futile.
	He said if the government took action to place a copy of the draft constitution before the people they would have an opportunity to study the proposals, criticize them or suggest alternatiives.
	However, Mr. Herath urged the government not to try to cover up the burning problems faced by the people through the new constitution adding that the main reason for the problems that have cropped up in the country was not the constitution.
	Referring to the statement made by Mahajana Eksath Peramuna (MEP) MP Dinesh Gunawardane that Articles of the 1978 Constitution, including those on upholding the Unitary State of the country and giving foremost place to Buddhism appears to have been omitted from the new Constitution, he said Mr. Gunawardane was trying to create unnecessary problems which did not exist.
	The draft constitution has not yet been issued. MP Gunawardane is talking about the document given to the MPs and it is not finalized. He is aware of this and I think he is just trying to rouse up unnecessary turmoil, he said.
	Mr. Herath also slammed the government for attempting to create another jumbo cabinet exceeding the promised number of 30 ministers.
	He said nepotism was continuing in the foreign missions to which a number of United National Party (UNP) Central Committee members had been appointed. (Piyumi Fonseka)

Ready to consider SL as the most favoured nation for trade: Sharif
	
Visiting Pakistan Prime Minister Nawasz Sharif today said Pakistan was ready to give Sri Lanka the most favoured nation (MFN) status in trade.
He expressed these views after signing eight memorandum of understanding (MoUs) with Sri Lanka in several fields, including nuclear, trade, defence, security and anti-terrorism.
The MOUs will help promote cooperation between Pakistan and Sri Lanka in several fields, including trade promotions, culture, healthcare, money laundering and combating terror financing, Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said while addressing a ceremony in Colombo, the Express Tribune reported.
There are vast opportunities for bilateral trade between Pakistan and Sri Lanka and the quantum of trade will be taken to $1 billion annually, he said.
Speaking about the constant efforts of the two countries to improve bilateral relations, PM Nawaz said, I reiterated Pakistans offer to set up cement and sugar plants in Sri Lanka on mutually agreed terms for the long-term benefit of the Sri Lankan economy.
Further, the premier also expressed the need for frequent port calls, participation in military exercises, defence seminars and training of military personnel between the two countries.
The two countries have not only agreed to work together in the field of gems and jewelry, but also fields like education, defence, science and technology and health care, he added.
We now look forward to welcoming President Maithripala Sirisena to Pakistan at an early date so that relations of mutual trust and confidence can be further enhanced, PM Nawaz said as he invited Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena to Pakistan.
Appreciating PM Nawazs efforts in improving relations with Sri Lanka and other countries, President Sirisena said Political instability in Pakistan will end under the leadership of PM Nawaz.

	Sri Lanka hopes to sign a Free Trade Agreement with the US in the future, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said today.
	He said this after launching the Pakistan Single Country" trade Exhibition together with his Pakistani counterpart Nawaz Sharif at Temple Trees.
	Mr. Wickremesinghe said Sri Lanka could be a gateway to countries such as Pakistan in its endeavour to enter the US market using this FTA.
	Sri Lanka hopes to sign Free Trade Agreements with Singapore, China and also enter into trade agreement with the US which would either be in the form of a FTA or a Comprehensive Preferential Trade Agreement (CPTA) so that Sri Lanka enter the markets around the Bay of Bengal," he said.
	Mr. Wickremesinghe said trade with Pakistan would help Sri Lanka step into Central Asia and set up extended trade ties with the countries in the Middle East and the Gulf.
	Remember that if you enter the Pakistan market you will be able to make your way towards Central Asia and extend your presence towards Middle East and the Gulf, he told the local members of the corporate sector who were present.
	The private sector should take an initiative and invest by taking risks. You cannot engage in trade without taking risks, Mr. Wickremesinghe said and added that Pakistan and Sri Lanka had agreed to appoint working committees comprising ministers to develop the existing FTAs.
	Prime Minister Sharif in his address stressed the need for developing and strengthening the FTA between the two countries. He invited the Export Development Board (EDB) to organize a Sri Lankan trade fair in Karachi. Mr. Sharif invited the Sri Lankan corporate sector to invest in Pakistan stating that his country would turn the tide this year.

Although the CCTV footage showed a vehicle in the vicinity of rugby player Wasim Thajudeen's killing, its license number could not be matched with the licence No: WP KU6543 supplied by the CID, the Colombo University's School Of Computing (UCSC) said today.
It informed Colombo Additional Magistrate Nishantha Peiris that the poor quality of the video footage and the UCSC's limited technical facilities were the reasons for being unable to do so and recommended that the video footage be examined at a well equipped forensic laboratory abroad such as the FBI, MPS or the new Scotland Yard.
The UCSC said the CID had forwarded four DVDs and a CD of the CCTV footage recorded in Narahenpita and Kirulapana.
It said the footage had been recorded during night and as such the strong lights from oncoming vehicles have distorted the image.
The UCSC also informed the Magistrate that it was unable to identify any human figures inside the vehicle.
Earlier, the Colombo Additional Magistrate Nishantha Peiris directed the USCS to examine the CCTV footage, relating to the killing of Mr.Thajudeen, and submit a report within 14 days.
The case will be taken up for inquiry on Thursday. (Shehan Chamika Silva)

According to a little bird tweeting from the palace, the purohita now in charge of money supply is to take over the subject of water supply. The Green economist from Kegalle is tipped to step into the vacant money supply portfolio while the Tree party chief is to take over a lion share of the state enterprises portfolio. Meanwhile, there is talk that state banking and insurance are also to be assigned to the Green economist.
There is also a proposal to separate Buddha Sasana from Justice in which event, the incumbent might continue in the portfolio sans Justice and a new face will take over the latter subject.

World's largest blue sapphire found in Sri Lanka
	
The largest blue star sapphire yet has been discovered in a mine at Ratnapura, the BBC reported today.
The gemology institute has certified that the gem weighs 1404.49 carats and that it had not certified anything larger.
The gem is worth at least $100m and the current owner estimates that it could sell for up to $175m at auction.
Sri Lanka's gem industry, for which sapphire is the main export, is worth at least 70m ($103m) annually. Blue star sapphires are so named because of the distinctive mark found at their centre.
"The moment I saw it, I decided to buy," the current owner, who wishes to remain anonymous, told the BBC World Service's Newsday programme.
"When the stone was brought to me I suspected that it might be the world's largest blue star sapphire. So I took a risk and bought it." The owner said it was "absolutely confidential" how much he paid for it. The previous record holder weighed 1,395 carats.
The new gem was mined in the city of Ratnapura, in southern Sri Lanka, which is known as the City of Gems. It has been named the The Star of Adam by its current owner, after a Muslim belief that Adam arrived in Sri Lanka after being sent away from the Garden of Eden. It is claimed he then lived on the slopes of a mountain now known as Adam's Peak.
The owner of the Star of Adam said he bought it thinking "this was not a piece of jewellery but an exhibition piece".
Speaking to the BBC, Armil Samoon, a leading gem and jewellery dealer in Sri Lanka, confirmed this was the largest blue star sapphire in the world. A 17kg (18 stone six pounds) rock containing sapphires was revealed in 2013, but the final weight of the gems inside is not yet known.
Sri Lanka's Gem and Jewellery Association said in 2011 that the engagement ring for Catherine Middleton, the Duchess of Cambridge, included a sapphire mined in the country in the 1970s. It was previously owned by Diana, Princess of Wales.
