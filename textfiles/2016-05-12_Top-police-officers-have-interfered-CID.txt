CID investigations have revealed that high ranking police officers had interfered into the preliminary investigations relating to the death of former ruggerite Waseem Thajudeen, Senior State Counsel Dilan Ratnayaka told Magistrate Nishantha Pieris today.

He also said that the CID had recorded statements from 20 Police officers and their statements to the police seemed to be contradictory.

Counsel Chatura Galhena representing the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) during the magisterial inquiry said that the SLMC had appointed a disciplinary committee to inquire on the panel of JMOs headed by former Chief JMO Ananda Samarasekera who conducted the first autopsy on Thajudeen’s body and the JMOs had been summoned to appear before the Committee in June.

Counsel Ratnayaka further said the behaviour of the former Narahenpitia Crimes OIC during the recovery of Thajudeen's wallet at Kirulapone was questionable. He requested the Magistrate to further remand the OIC.

He also moved court to order the Mobitel mobile phone Company to provide details of mobile phone conversation of the deceased and the suspects to the CID.

The Counsel further asserted that the CID was examining CCTV footage on the incident with the assistance of experts in Canada and England.

The Magistrate while ordering Mobitel Company to provide details of the phone conversations to the CID ordered the SLMC to submit a report on their investigations to court.

The former Narahenpita Crimes OIC was further remanded till May 26. (T. Farook Thajudeen)
