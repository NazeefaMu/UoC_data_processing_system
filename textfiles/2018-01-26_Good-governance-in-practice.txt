‘Good governance’ in practice


	



 

Seven important posts in a key ministry had fallen vacant and in keeping with the recruitment procedure the vacancies were duly advertised. 

 


Later 69 applicants with the requisite qualifications were interviewed and the most qualified seven were selected for appointment. 


Meanwhile, the purohita in charge of the Ministry sent for his secretary and gave him a list of seven names. “These seven chaps are from my electorate. Appoint them to the seven vacant posts in the Ministry. Issue the appointment letters after the upcoming polls!” the purohita told him.  


The secretary nonplussed by this unexpected order said: “But, Sir, this is quite irregular. These people didn’t even come for the interview!”


“I say, you shut your gab, do what I say!” was the purohita’s curt rejoinder.
