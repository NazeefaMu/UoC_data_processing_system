Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa’s security officers today apprehended a middle-aged man who was acting in a suspicious manner at Mr. Rajapaksa’s recently opened political office at Nelum Mawatha, Jayanthipura, Battaramulla.

A meeting with the Former President Rajapaksa and Opposition Parliamentarians was taking place at the time the suspicious man had tried to enter the political office.

Mr. Rajapaksa’s security team handed over the man, a resident of Athurugiriya, to the Thalangama Police, Spokesman ASP Ruwan Gunasekara said.

However, the Thalangama Police said the man was apprehended as he did not have his national identity card.

Former Western Province Provincial Council Member and in-charge of Mr. Rajapaksa’s political office in Battaramulla Renuka Perera, speaking to the Daily Mirror said the man had tried to enter the political office citing he was asked to come and meet Mr. Renuka Perera.

However, when Mr. Perera had come out to check on the situation and it was found that the person had tried to fool the security officers as such a meeting has not been fixed by Mr. Perera with that particular person.

“We were observing three persons who were noticed for roaming around the office for several days before. Finally, our security officers had identified that the man who was apprehended was one of those suspicious persons,” he said.

He also said due to his suspicious behaviour, it was later found out his statements were contradictory and unclear.

Meanwhile, he said that different people often come to the office citing various reasons.

He suspected that they could be from the Intelligence Service with the purpose of getting information relating to the political activities of the former president.

Thalangama Police OIC Nishantha Herath said the suspect would be further interrogated and would be produced in Court tomorrow. (Piyumi Fonseka)
