The Magistrate has also ordered the motorcycle, valued more than Rs. 1 million, to be confiscated.

The Police arrested the 23-year old man, a resident of Gurugoda in Horana for riding the high capacity motorcycle with a fake number plate.

The Police filed 12 charges against him, including illegally importing the vehicle, using a fake number plate, driving without registering and reckless riding.
