The Ceylon Chamber of Commerce (CCC) is inviting corporate firms to be a part of its annual Business Events Calendar of the year 2017/2018, which plans to hold a series of key business events, forums, seminars and discussions throughout the year.
The chamber’s Business Events Calendar, every year, executes a multiple of events covering topics such as the economy, trade, investment, taxation, budget, policy, IT and innovation and also other timely topics.
During the ongoing calendar year, the CCC will hold over 15 business seminars and forums of great value to the business community. The planned events will focus on a multiple of topics and will attract a large and a diverse audience. The usefulness and interest of these seminars could be measured through the participation at each of these seminars, which runs up to a maximum of 250 and a minimum of 40 persons representing a large number of organisations. The corporate firms, which become annual partners, will receive wide-scale benefits in return for their commitment for the chamber’s Business Events Calendar.
