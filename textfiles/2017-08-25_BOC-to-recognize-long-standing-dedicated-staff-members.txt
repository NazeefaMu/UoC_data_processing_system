Bank of Ceylon will recognize its long standing staff members who have enriched the legacy of the bank through their sweat and tears. 


The event will take place at the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall (BMICH) on Saturday 26 August 2017 with the patronage of the bank’s Chairman, President’s Counsel Ronald C. Perera and the General Manager. D.M. Gunasekera. The members of the corporate and executive management and other bank officials will also participate in this event. 


Two hundred and thirty four staff members including a few members of the corporate and executive management who will be recognized on this day have contributed over 25 years of their life to uplift the nation’s banker - Bank of Ceylon - for it to continue as the number-one bank in the country. These employees have served the bank uninterrupted for over 25 years and have adhered to the regulations, maintaining the highest level of integrity and trust throughout their service. The bank will appreciate their noble service with a gold coin and a certificate of recognition. It is important to note that family members of these employees too have been invited to take part in this event. The bank has recognized employees who have had long service record in previous years too.


Currently Bank of Ceylon has over 8000 employees altogether serving in the local branch network, head office, in the bank’s foreign branches and in the banking subsidiary in London. The bank’s Human Resource Development division spearheaded this programme. “Believing employee recognition is the best motivation an employer can provide, the Bank of Ceylon’s Human Resource Development division gives special attention to every detail possible to make this event a success. Apart from employee recognizing events such as these, we ensure that we build the staff member’s professional and personal life through proper Human Resource Development mechanisms,” stated Human Resources Deputy General Manager K.E.D. Sumanasiri. “The bank has achieved a highly esteemed status in the Sri Lankan banking industry, and I’m thankful to the staff who provided a committed and dedicated service” he further added.
