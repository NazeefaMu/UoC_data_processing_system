The SLFP MPs who left the government warned that they would boycott the May Day Rally organised by the party unless the party replaced several office bearers holding key positions.

They said they would organise a separate May Day Rally if these changes do not take place. They said they would meet the President and hold discussions about this today (23).

The former ministers emphasized the fact that there was no future for the party if it retains certain individuals as office bearers.(Sujith Hewajulige)
