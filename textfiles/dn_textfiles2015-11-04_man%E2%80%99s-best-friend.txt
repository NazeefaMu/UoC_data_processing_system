A PERFORMANCE TO CELEBRATE
Man’s BEST FRIEND

November 5 will be an evening of music and entertainment to celebrate the life of Man's Best Friend, at the Dutch Burgher Union Hall from 7.30 pm onwards, featuring several artists including the De Lanerolle Brothers, Ryan Henderling, Vithma Kumarage, Darren Stork and Dinukshi Hettige, Roshanara & Roshana Tissaaratchy and Melanie Bibile.
The concert was organised by the Animal Protection Trust and focuses on the eradication of Rabies that has been a plight throughout Sri Lanka. The Animal Protection Trust is a non-profit organisation that endeavours to foster the humane treatment of all animals in Sri Lanka and actively lobbies to have the Animal Welfare Bill passed in Parliament. The Trust has also taken legal action to bring in new laws against prevention of cruelty to animals and bring in regulations for pet shops and breeders.
