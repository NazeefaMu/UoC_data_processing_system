Parliamentarians Vasudeva Nanayakkara and Wimal Weerawansa today submitted a complain to the Bribery Commission regarding a probe into a Ports Authority land that was provided to a private company on which the Supreme Court had earlier asked that action be taken against ex-President Chandrika Kumaratunga.
The former ministers charged that the Bribery Commission, the Criminal Investigation Division and the Attorney General had been directed by the Supreme Court to look into the matter but no action had been taken for the past seven years.  
“The 10-acre land that belonged to the Ports Authority was used for bunkering. During Chandrika Kumaratunga’s regime it was handed over to a private company,” Nanayakkara said.  
The parliamentarian had then filed a petition in the Supreme Court which had directed the authorities to re-acquire the land and compensate the ports authority workers who were unemployed due to the move.  
 “No action has been taken for the past seven years and therefore we decided to complain the Bribery Commission of the Supreme Court order and inquire into the action that have been taken over the matter,” the former National Languages and Social Integration Minister of said. (Sanath Desmond)
