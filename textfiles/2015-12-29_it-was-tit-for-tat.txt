It was tit for tat!


	

The news that a sporty off spring of a former VVIP was admitted to a private nursing home after being beaten, made a sensation even in political circles last week.
Subsequent reports said that the attack was believed to be an act of revenge for a thrashing given to a certain rival team of players during a tournament conducted in a hill country playground. 
The sporty one who once brooked no resistance while on his grand march to his goals was quite used to  bulldozing his way through. At that time he was accompanied by a regiment of security guards.  However, he had no security when he came under attack last week.
