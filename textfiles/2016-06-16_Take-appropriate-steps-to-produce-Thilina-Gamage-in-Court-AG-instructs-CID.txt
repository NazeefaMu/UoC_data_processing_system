‘Take appropriate steps to produce Thilina Gamage in Court' - AG instructs CID


	

The Additional Solicitor General had instructed the Criminal Investigation Department today to take appropriate steps to produce former Magistrate Thilina Gamage in the Gangodawila Magistrate's Court over the inquiry, in which he was an accused of keeping an elephant in contravention to the Public Property and Fauna and Flora Act, sources said.

The Attorney General's Department sent the instructions in writing to the CID along with the suspension order, which was given on June 13 by the Colombo High Court against the Gangodawila Magistrate Kanishka Wijeratne's order of releasing Thilina Gamage on bail on June 2.

He was earlier released on bail by the Gangodawila Magistrate over the inquiry. (Shehan Chamika)
