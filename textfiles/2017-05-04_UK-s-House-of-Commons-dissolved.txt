The British Parliament’s House of Commons was officially dissolved on Wednesday with all business coming to an end ahead of the June 8 snap general election announced by Prime Minister Theresa May.

Ms May met with Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace and marked the dissolution of the 650-member House of Commons or the lower house. Her meeting with the 91-year-old monarch marked the formal start of campaigning for the election even though all political parties have already begun canvassing.

“The dissolution of Parliament took place on Wednesday 3 May 2017. All business in the House of Commons has come to an end and there are no MPs. Every seat in the Commons is vacant until after the general election on 8 June 2017,” the British Parliament said in a statement. (Deccan Chronicle)
