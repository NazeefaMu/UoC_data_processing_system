Deputy Minister Palitha Thewarapperuma had injured his leg after falling into a hole while chasing after cattle-rustlers. The Deputy Minister was alerted about a vehicle transporting cattle for slaughter and gave chase. The minister, with the help of several supporters, caught up to the vehicle and intercepted it.

The two occupants of the van containing the cattle, that had been trussed up and tied in an inhuman manner, were apprehended by the deputy minister while another managed to escape their clutches and attempted to flee. The deputy minister however did not give up and gave chase. However as a consequence he had fallen into a hole in the road and injured his leg. The lorry and the suspects were handed over to the Beruwala police.

The suspects are believed to be residents of Munhena in Matugama.(S. Madawala)
