A raffle that baffles everyone!


	



 

A certain chief purohita has launched a lottery purportedly to raise funds for a good cause beneficial to the entire province. School teachers, children and employees in government offices in the province are asked to buy the tickets of this lottery, they say.

 


Meanwhile, there is a growing suspicion among the people that the monies raised from lottery ticket sales are being channeled to an election fund and a media group looking into the whys and wherefores of this lottery project has drawn angry threats from the provincial authority, 
they say.


By the way, some teachers and school children who have been asked to sell the lottery tickets are planning to make representations to the Number One in yahapalanaya about the unpleasant job foisted on them. And they also say that responsible authorities functioning in a city hallowed by the presence of sacred Sri Dalada should think twice before launching dubious projects like this lottery.
