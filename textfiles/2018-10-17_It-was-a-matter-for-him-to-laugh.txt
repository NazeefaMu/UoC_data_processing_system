It was a matter for him to laugh!


	



 

The news that the former strongman and Number One in Yahapalanaya had held a one-on-one powwow created a big stir in political circles recently.

 


This news had ruffled a senior Green purohita, who decided that the party chief- who was abroad at that time- should be posted on this unexpected development.


However, instead of contacting the Green Chief directly, he phoned up a senior colleague, who was in the team that accompanied the chief.


After apprising his colleague of all about this disturbing development, he had warned that they had to make an effective counter-move before the worst possible could come to pass.


However, the response he got from his colleague at the other end of the line was something quite unexpected.


The colleague was laughing uncontrollably!


Ha! Ha! Ha! coming over the phone infuriated the Senior Purohita.


“I say, is what I told you a joke for you to laugh? Can’t you understand that this is a serious matter?”


The colleague laughed again. After controlling his mirth, he had told him: 


“My dear friend, don’t take this matter seriously!  Our people usually say something in the morning and an entirely different thing in the afternoon! Consider this meeting as something as unimportant as say, a fart!  This is not something to worry out but, something to laugh about!”
