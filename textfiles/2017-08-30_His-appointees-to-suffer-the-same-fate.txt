His appointees to suffer the same fate


	



 

Lotteries had been tagged onto foreign affairs in a bizarre arrangement some time ago. 

 


However, the purohita who took over foreign affairs recently did not want to sell lotteries as part of his new job. So it went back to the finance ministry where it really belonged. 


Meanwhile, the white collar bigwigs of the lotteries boards appointed by the previous purohita were handed the walking papers, but they all stayed-put refusing to budge. 


When the question of sacking them arose, some people said: “Why should the man now down and out be further hurt? Let the chaps he appointed carry on!”


So the innocent one immediately went sentimental and got second thoughts about sacking his predecessor’s appointees. 


However, an order has come from above to replace the old appointees with new ones, they say.
