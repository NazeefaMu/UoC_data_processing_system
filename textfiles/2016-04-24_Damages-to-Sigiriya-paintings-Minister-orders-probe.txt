Minister of Education Akila Viraj Kariyawasam has on Saturday (23) ordered the Central Cultural Fund and the Department of Archaeology to investigate the incident of damage caused to the Sigiriya paintings when cello tape pasted on the plaster for some rehabilitation activity was being removed.


When the journalists visited the site on Sunday to observe about the incident they had not been allowed to enter the relevant cave and to take photos. However, an official of the Central Cultural Fund had told them that damage to the plaster had been reported and an internal investigation had begun.


Meanwhile, a dispute between the Cultural Fund and the Archaeological Department has also been reported. (Kanchana Kumar Ariyadasa)
