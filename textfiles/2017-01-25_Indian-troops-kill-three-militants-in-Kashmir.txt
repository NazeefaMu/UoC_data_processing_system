SRINAGAR AFP/ Jan24, 2017-
Police and troops killed three militants in two separate gunbattles in Indian-administered Kashmir on Tuesday, one of them near the de facto border with Pakistan, officers said.  


Soldiers and members of the police’s special operations group surrounded Hadoora, some 25 kilometres (15 miles) north of the main city of Srinagar, after a tip-off about suspected rebels inside a house in the village.  


 “In the ensuing gunfight two militants were killed. Both are foreigners” (a standard reference to rebels from Pakistan-administered Kashmir), police Superintendent Imtiyaz Ismael told AFP.  


In a separate incident a group of militants attempted to cross the Line of Control (LoC) that divides Kashmir between India and Pakistan in the Sundabani sector, but were intercepted by Indian soldiers.  
 “One terrorist was eliminated in the operation while the balance group fled towards Pakistan Occupied Kashmir,” said an army statement.
