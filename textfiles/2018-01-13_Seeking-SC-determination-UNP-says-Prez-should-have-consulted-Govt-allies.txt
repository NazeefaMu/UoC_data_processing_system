Seeking SC determination; UNP says Prez should have consulted Govt. allies


	

The United National Party (UNP) said yesterday it would have been much better for President Maithripala Sirisena to have consulted the government allies before seeking a determination from the Supreme Court on the expiry of his term of office.

In an interview with Daily Mirror, Minister and House Leader Lakshman Kiriella said this had caused some uneasiness among the government allies.

He said even if the Court ruled it to be at the end of six years, the President had the option of calling for an early presidential election at the end of five years.

The Supreme Court is expected to convey its determination to the President on Sunday.

With Parliament approving the 19th Amendment to the Constitution the President's term of office was reduced from the previous six years to five creating an ambiguity. (Kelum Bandara)
