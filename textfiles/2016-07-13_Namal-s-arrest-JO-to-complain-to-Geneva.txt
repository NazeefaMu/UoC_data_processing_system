Namal’s arrest: JO to complain to Geneva


	

The Joint Opposition said yesterday that it would complain to the General Secretary of the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) in Geneva, Switzerland over the arrest of its MP Namal Rajapaksa.

Joint Opposition stalwart UPFA MP Bandula Gunawardena who once went to Geneva and complained to the IPU General Secretary against the government, said they were forced to make another complain to the IPU.

Commenting on the recent arrest of MP Rajapaksa, he said it was a political witch hunt by the government and therefore, they have to seek the assistance of the IPU.

“He was arrested not based on a complaint by any party directly involved in the alleged case. He was arrested based on a complaint by the Anti-Corruption Front Convener Wasantha Samarasinghe who is a member of the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP). Minister Mahinda Amaraweera once complained to the Bribery Commission against Central Bank’s ex- governor Arjuna Mahendran. No action was taken so far. These are the results of deal politics,” he said.

He charged the democratic values were shattered in the country today based on the lack of management by the government and its poor decisions taken.

MP Gunawardena accompanied by MPs Dullas Alahapperuma and Udaya Gammanpila, who was also arrested recently, went to Geneva and complained about the Financial Crime Investigation Division (FCID) among other allegations of injustice caused towards them by the Government in late March.

When MP Gammanpila was arrested last month on charges of allegedly using a fraudulent Power of Attorney to sell shares of an Australian company, MP Gunawardena said they would go to Geneva again to complain over the arrest. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
