We have exciting plans ahead, which I am confident will not disappoint our clients. With the best rewards program currently in the market – the 360<U+25E6> degrees rewards program, coupled with the Visa Infinite card and its unique global benefits and eligibility for Hilton Honours Gold status, and the Harrods Black Card, our teams of experienced Relationship Managers and Service Support are poised to actualise and address our clients’ banking requirements.”
