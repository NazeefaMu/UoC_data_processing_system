Competitive exam not competitive for the favoUred
	

A competitive exam had been held recently to select 100 candidates for recruitment as security assistants of a leading state-owned corporation. And a report says that the question paper set for the exam had been leaked out in advance to the candidates from a Southern district which a certain powerful purohita represents in the council. By the way, the state-owned corporation in question comes under the purview of his Ministry.

A fair Deputy hailing from another district in the South has kicked up a row over this question paper leak saying that the candidates from her district suffered an injustice as a result.
Now the fair one is engaged in a battle to have the results of the exam declared null and void to make way for holding a fresh exam, they say.

Feeding fasting protesters to spite political foe

This member holding a high post in the august assembly has been supplying food for the fasting employees from a restaurant he owns, they say.
Three people well-known for three different kinds of activities are directly involved in this catering service on the sly.
The Diyawanna member, daggers drawn with a purohita has found that a congenial way of hitting at the latter is to back the fasting employees, they say.

Addressing a media briefing, MP Weerawansa said the party would be guided by Mr. Mahinda Rajapaksa and all others including former minister Basil Rajapaksa, would be of equal standing.If a new party is formed under the leadership of Mr. Mahinda Rajapaksa, we will be a part of it, he added.

He said NFF have warned the people even before this of such moves by the government and their predictions had become reality. He also said it was their responsibility to inform the public of the dangers posed by such moves.

Gammanpila using politics to cover up his crime: JHU
	
The Jathika Hela Urumaya said today that close associates of UPFA MP Udaya Gammanpila were attempting to spread rumours that his arrest was a result of his criticism of the Yahapalana Governement, and that they are trying to dress him up in different political clothes to cover up his crimes.
JHU National Organiser Nishantha Sri Warnasinghe said people were trying to pretend that Gammanpila was arrested because he was a patriot, for being a Sinhala Buddhist leader, for talking against federalism and for being against this government.
To create that image, he had even used monks to issue character certificates for him, he said this while addressing a press conference at JHU head office in Battaramulla.MP Udaya Gammanpila was arrested by the Police Special Investigation Unit over a charge where he had allegedly used his power of attorney to sell shares of an Australian company, he said.
We should clearly say that Gammanpila is trying to use patriotism and Buddhism as a shield to try to protect himself from the law and mislead the country, Warnasinghe said.Everyone is trying to point the finger at JHU General Secretary MP Champika Ranawaka saying that he is influencing the judiciary and the police with regards to the arrest of Gammanpila, the JHU National Organiser claimed.
They are saying that if people remain loyal to the government they will not face charges by any law enforcement authority, Warnasinghe said.The focus of this investigation should be on a fraudulent act that took place 19 years ago and nothing else," he said.
Australian Businessman Bryan Shadik, MP Udaya Gammanpila, the complainant Lasith Perera and Sydney Jayasinghe (who was remanded along with Mr. Gammanpila in connection with this case) are the people who will know the truth behind the fraud, he said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

Govt. must claim damages from Mahendrans son-in-law: JVP
	
The Government not only needs to remove the Central Bank Governor Arujuna Mahendran from his post but also should claim damages from him and the company owned by his son-in-law, the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) said today.
JVP Leader and Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake told a media briefing that the government should recover the extra funds earned by Mr. Mahendran's son-in-law from the fraudulent purchase of bonds.
Mr Dissanayake said the interest rate of the final phase of the March 2015 bond issue jumped to 14.6 percent whereas the interest rate of the initial phase was 12 per cent.
In his address to the nation on August 2016, President Maithirpala said he had told Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe that Mr. Mahendran should be asked to resign as otherwise it will tarnish the PM's image. This clearly shows that the President is fully aware that something fishy had taken place, he said.
Mr. Dissanayake said the government could not pass the buck on the parliamentary Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) as it had been appointed to carry out the specific task of monitoring public institutions and not to penalize anyone.
It is the President and the Prime Minister who should act now, he said. (Yohan Perera)

Govt. to expedite signing of ETCA
	
The Government has decided to expedite the signing of the proposed Economic and Technology Cooperation Agreement (ECTA) with India in the wake of the decision by Britain to exit the European Union (EU), sources from the premier's office said yesterday.
They said this decision was taken after Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe met leading business magnates soon after he returned from Galle last evening.
Sources said the business magnates had suggested that the signing of ECTA with India would be advantageous because Sri Lankas exports to Britain amounting to some 40 per cent of countrys total exports to Europe was uncertain given the new situation in Europe.
According to reports, Sri Lankan officials including the prime ministerial adviser R. Paskaralingam will visit India to join External Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrama, who is already in Delhi so as to negotiate with India and fast track the signing of the agreement.
Sources said Sri Lanka would also explore the possibility of signing trade agreements with countries such as Bangladesh and Myanmar. (Yohan Perera)

Govt. using Brexit as excuse to sign ECTA: GL
	
The Government is attempting to expedite the signing of the Economic and Technology Cooperation Agreement (ECTA) with India in the wake of Britain leaving the European Union, would amount to a jump from the frying pan into the fire, the joint opposition charged today.
Former UPFA MP G.L. Peiris told a news conference that any quantum leap to open the service sector to another country should be taken after an in-depth consideration of the foreign trade agreements.
He said Sri Lanka should first rectify the shortcomings of the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) signed with India before expanding trade between the two countries.
The government is using Brexit as an excuse to expedite ETCA which has been rejected by professionals and intellectuals in Sri Lanka. ETCA is a promise given by the Government to India for helping it to come to power. If the government signs the agreement without rectifying the FTA, it will be similar to the idiomatic jump from the frying pan into the fire, he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Nine Lankans held for bid to go to Australia
	
Nine Sri Lankans were arrested at Tiruchendur, Tuticorin in Tamil Nadu today for allegedly planning to travel to Australia in a clandestine manner, police said.
"The Sri Lankans who arrived in Tamil Nadu on tourist visas were tricked into believing that they could go to Australia," a top district police official told PTI.
He said they were picked up from a lodging house in the temple town of Tiruchendur by officials of "Q branch" police.
A senior Q Branch police official in Chennai confirmed the arrests. He, however, declined to disclose further information, including the foreign nationals' proposed mode of travel to Australia, stating probe was underway.
The arrest comes against the backdrop of risky boat rides in the past by Sri Lankan Tamils to reach Australia and seek asylum there.
They had tried to reach Australia from different origin points in Sri Lanka and also in India and a section of them succeeded only to be turned away by Australia for seeking asylum illegally.
Several Sri Lankan refugees living in camps in the state had been duped by unscrupulous agents into believing that a journey to Australia, in a boat, was possible.
Refugees were lured by the fake promise that asylum could be sought in Australia, where living conditions were better than India.
Australia has been warning against such ventures, saying it would not allow people taking illegal route to enter the country. (Business Standard)

SL ranked No.50 in Human Capital Index
	
Sri Lanka is at No.50 in the worldwide Human Capital Index (HCI), which was launched today by the World Economic Forum (WEF).
Finland topped the index which measures a countrys ability to nurture, develop and deploy talent for economic growth.

The Index covers six countries in the South Asian region including Sri Lanka (50), Bhutan (91), Bangladesh (104), India (105), Nepal (108) and Pakistan (118). The overall average score for the region is 59.92, the WEF stated.
The WEF stated that Sri Lanka was a bright spot for the region which benefited from strong educational enrolment and basic education completion rates as well as positive perceptions of the quality of its primary schools and education system overall (23rd on both).
However, it underperforms when it comes to translating the potential of its young population to the workforce, with one in four young people not active in employment, education or training.
The regions most populous countries -- Bangladesh, India and Pakistan are held back by insufficient educational enrolment rates and poor quality primary schools. The youth literacy rate in the three countries stands at 83%, 89% and 75% respectively, far behind other emerging markets as well as.
Meanwhile, Norway, Switzerland, Canada and Japan were ranked 2 to 5 respectively while Mauritania ranked last in the list.

Snobbish lady snubbed
	

Members, purohitas and the white-collar bigwigs of the Diyawanna council normally walk into the premises carrying their personal effects like bags and umbrellas. However, a lady recently appointed as the secretary of an office in the Diyawanna complex had ordered the council employees to carry her laptop bag to her office on her arrival to the council.

Irked by the ladys order considered unreasonable given that even the much more important persons than her do not find it infra-dig to carry their personal effects, the council staff had complained about it to a high authority in the council administration.
In a prompt response to this complaint by the staff, the council authority had put its foot down saying: Dont carry her bags. You are not here to do the porters job.
Now the lady attends work carrying her laptop bag and the very sight of a council staffer would bring a scowl to her face, they say.

Defence Secretary Karunasena Hettiarachchi said the decision taken by the Government, to replace the military security provided to former defence secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa with the Police and the STF, would not be changed under any circumstance.
On an earlier occasion, he had said that military personnel deployed for the security of former president Mahinda Rajapaksa and former defence secretary would be gradually removed and replaced with Police and STF personnel, because deploying military personnel for VIP security was illegal.
However, Gotabaya Rajapaksa said yesterday that he had requested Mr. Hettiarachchi not to remove the military security provided to him because there were still threats to his life.
He said that he had not been officially informed so far about his military security being replaced with police personnel.
Commenting on former defence secretary Rajapaksas security, Mr. Hettiarachchi said there would be no change of plans to remove the military security provided to VIPs and replace it with police personnel.(Darshana Sanjeewa)
