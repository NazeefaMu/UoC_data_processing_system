While stating that the Janabalaya Kolambata was the most successful protest campaign ever in the political history of Sri Lanka, the Joint Opposition challenged the Government to go for a General Election if they claimed that the protest was unsuccessful.

Addressing a news briefing, JO member Namal Rajapaksa said they were able to accomplish the task more than they intended amidst Government’s moves to sabotage the protest and prevent it from taking place.

“The Government still says that the protest was a failure. We can’t fathom as to why they say so after having witnessed the mounting displeasure from thousands of people gathered in the protest,” Namal said.     

“We challenge the ruling parties to go for an election so that they can see what would be their destiny,” he added. (Sheain Fernandopulle)
