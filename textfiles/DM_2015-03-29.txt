Aussies dismisses Kiwis for 183
	
Australia has powered into Cricket World Cup final favouritism after dismissing New Zealand for 183 at the MCG.
James Faulkner (3 for 36) and Mitchell Johnson (3 for 30) led the way with able support from Mitchell Starc (2 for 20) to dismantle the Black Caps in Melbourne on Sunday.
Grant Elliott looked to repeat his semi-final heroics with a rapid 83, but the damage had already been done when Starc struck early to dismiss fiery opener Brendon McCullum for a duck.
Wickets fell quickly as Martin Guptill (15) and Kane Williamson (12) were dismissed cheaply, before Elliott and Ross Taylor (40) paired together for a 111-run partnership.
But Taylor fell to a wide, slower Faulkner delivery which found the top-edge through to the gloves of the diving, out-stretched Brad Haddin.
That wicket triggered a major collapse as Faulkner bowled the pinch hitter for a duck, before former Australian Luke Ronchi fell for zero with an edge to Michael Clarke in the slips off Starc's bowling.
Johnson farewlled departing Black Caps veteran Daniel Vettori, who could only inside-edge the left armer's yorker onto his leg stump.
Elliott fell to another caught-behind off Faulkner, before Matt Henry became the fourth duck of the innings, spearing the ball straight to Starc at point off Johnson's bowling.
The last wicket fell in ignominous fashion as Glenn Maxwell ran out Tim Southee (11) at the non-striker's end, with the batsman failing to get his bat back in time after being sent back.
Australia is aiming to win its fifth World Cup title, while New Zealand is looking to secure its first-ever world championship.

Govt. trying to evacuate SL maids in Yemen
	
Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Ajith P. Perera said today the ministry was taking every possible move to bring back Sri Lankans stranded in Yemen as Saudi-led airstrikes had been increased on Houthi rebels who had begun advancing on the capital Sanaa.
According to the Deputy Minister, the government could contact United Nations and some other humanitarian organisations requesting their assistance to evacuate 120 Sri Lankans who had been stranded in Sanaa.
We are waiting for a response from the UN now. We came to know that Indian government has sent ships to Yemen to bring their nationals back. We have contacted Indian High Commission in Yemen too since we have no representatives in Yemen, he said.
Mr. Perera said that at the moment, all the 120 Sri Lankans are staying in Sanna and needed precautions would be taken to save the Sri Lankans by bringing them safely to the motherland.
Houthi rebels are seeking to overthrow Yemeni President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi while advancing to capital Sanna.
Meanwhile, in a BBC report, Saudi Arabia had said military intervention in Yemen would continue until the country is "stable and safe".
However, continuous airstrikes has hit cities across Yemen while a considerable number of civilians have also been killed. (Piyumi Fonseka)
