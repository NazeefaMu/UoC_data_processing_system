Some 300 disabled police and Special Task Force (STF) personnel launched a fast at the Pensions Department office complex in Colombo today.

They came to the Department office in Maradana earlier today to discuss the issues related to their pension anomalies.

The protesters said they would not leave the premises until their demands were granted. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)
