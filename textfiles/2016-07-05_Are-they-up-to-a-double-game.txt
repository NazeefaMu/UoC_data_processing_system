Are they up to a double game?


	



 

Two senior purohitas of late have begun giving lessons on ‘How to run a government’ both in public and in private and several members in yahapalanaya have complained to the two leaders at the top about the peculiar conduct of the two purohitas, they say. 

 


These two senior purohitas hail from the same district and one of them is well known as a ladies’ man.  Both of them held high office in the previous administration too and were then staunch loyalists of the former strongman.


It is no secret that the two purohitas later switched their allegiance to the Compassionate One in anticipation of places in the top team in yahapalanaya as well.


Some sections in the Betel leaf party suspect that the twosome are up to some double game.
