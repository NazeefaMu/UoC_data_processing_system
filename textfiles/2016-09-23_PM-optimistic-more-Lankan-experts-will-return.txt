PM optimistic more Lankan experts will return


	

A number of Sri Lankan experts, including academics and professionals, who left the country had returned recently and more experts would hopefully follow them in the near future, said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday.

Addressing a ceremony held to launch the construction of the Techno City at Mahahena in Homagama, the Premier said he had invited Sri Lankan experts to return, not alone, but with their colleagues.

“We should utilise human resources to the utmost. Today, the US knows that China has the biggest GDP for a country. That is why the US is recruiting people with expertise to face this growing threat. We, too, should fortify ourselves with knowledge by retaining local experts in the country,” he said.

He went on to note that the pace of development of a country depends on its development in the field of science and technology -- and that ‘Techno City’ would become a centre in the endeavour to strengthen Sri Lanka's citizens with knowledge.

“This move, without a doubt, will become one of the milestones in the political and economic history of Sri Lanka. Science and technology should not be limited to one stream of subjects, all should acquire a knowledge of science,” he said.

Techno City was launched under the first phase of the Megapolis Development Plan by the Megapolis and Western Development Ministry.

The Prime Minister launched the project on the invitation of Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka and in the presence of Science, Technology and Research Minister Susil Premajayantha.

At the launch, the premier declared open SLINTEC, the Technology Incubation Centre. Foundation stones were laid to construct a National Science Centre and a Satellite Centre in the city. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
