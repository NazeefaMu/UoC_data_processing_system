Ochini and Nirmala clinch CP Table Tennis titles

Fourteen year old Ochini Dissanaike of Mahamaya Girls College came up with a stunning performance to win the Ladies Open Event while the same event for Men was grabbed by former National champion Nirmala Jayasinghe of MAS Holdings at the 4th Sakura Holdings Challenge Shield Central Province Table Tennis Championship organised by the Kandy District Table Tennis Association and sponsored by Sakura Holdings (Pvt) Limited and worked off at the Jagath Rajapakse International Table Tennis Stadium, in Ganegoda off Peradeniya.
Over 400 paddlers ranging from the age of 8 to working class participated in this major event which saw many upsets including that of reigning Junior and Senior National champion Udaya Ranasinghe of Vidyartha College who could not win a single event. This was one championship he went winless since he started playing about eight years rose up to become the youngest National champion and the same year in 2014 he won the Junior National Title as well at the age of 15.
Ochini Dissanaike who won the Ladies Singles has a national ranking of 20 and has been striving hard often coming up with good performances at Junior Level but she at her age group level had high level performers like Samadhi Hettiarachchi, Thanushi Rodrigo, Sandamini Kularatne, and Janani Pushpakumara to contend with and often it is one of the those paddlers who grabbed the honours.
In the Ladies Open finals she beat the highly talented Samadhi Hettiarachchi of Mahamaya Girls College 3/2 after a gruelling battle a match which could have gone either way and the spectators were at the edge of their seats till Ochini Dissanaike finished off the raging battle with a 11/6 win after being led ½ at the end of the third set.
The battle started off with Ochini Dissanaike winning the first set 11/7 but Samadhi Hettiarachchi fought back in the second set to win 11/4 to level the match. The third set saw Samadhi Hettiarachchi forge ahead with a 11/6 win in the third set to lead 2/1. Came the crucial fourth set and a win by Samadhi could finish off the battle but if Ochini wins the match will go into the fifth set. Ochini won the fourth set 11/6 and the scores were level at 2 all. The decisive fifth set saw Ochini Dissanaike putting up a fine display while Samadhi Hettiarachci played some what a relaxed game and paid the penalty for it losing 6/11. In the semi finals the Central Province open event champion Kanchana Wedagedera of Sri Lanka Army and Sandamini Kularatne of Mahamaya Girls College fell off.
The Open Men’s singles went to former national champion and Sri Lanka’s captain to the Asian Championship in China. Having a national ranking of number two Nirmala Jayasinghe scored a facile 3/0 win over Chathura Gunasekera of Sussex College with the loser unable to meet the drops and smashed by the winner. But Chathura Gunasekera had the distinction of beating the national champion Udaya Ranasinghe in the semi finals.
The Girls under 15 event saw Tharushi Rodrigo of Mahamaya College defeat her schoolmate Sandamini Kularatne 3/1. The loser put up a good fight but could not polish off the sets with a win. But she did show good progress. The under 15 event for boys was won by the up and coming Chathura Gunasekera of Sussex College who won 3/1 against Disanka Tennakoon of Dharmaraja College.
The under 18 girls singles event saw the reversal of fortunes with Sandamini Kularatne of Mahamaya College scoring a shock 3/2 win over her earlier vanquisher Thanushi Rodrigo. This was a match which saw alternating winning trend. Sandamini lost the first set 10/12 and won the second set 11/8. Thanushi won the third set 11/7 only to concede the fourth set 8/11. Sandamini exerting more power and placement of shots won the crucial fifth set 11/5 to wrap up the proceedings.
Krishan Wickremaratne was another Vidyarthian to prove his mettle when he won the boys under 18 title by toppling none other than the reigning national champion Udaya Ranasinghe 3/1 in the finals. Udaya Ranasinghe who appeared to be short of practice put up an unimpressive display winning only the second set 11/6 but the rest was won by Krishan in style and the match did not even go into the fifth set. The losers in the semi finals were Chathura Gunasekera and Tilina Wijesiri both good performers.
Tharani Galagoda of Hillwood College is turning out to be a bright prospect as she once again won the girls under 12 title by defeating Hasini Ikiriwatte of Hillwood College 3/1, Tharani Galagoda scored comprehensive wins in the first sets including a rare win in the first set but lost closely in the third set losing 1012.
