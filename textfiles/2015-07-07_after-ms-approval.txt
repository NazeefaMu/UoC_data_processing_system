The United People’s Freedom Alliance (UPFA) said it would finalize its nomination lists tomorrow after it is approved by President Maitripala Sirisena, party officials said.
The UPFA factions, loyal to President Sirisena and former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, had lengthy discussions yesterday to iron out differences on the candidates to be fielded.
UPFA stalwart Dalles Alahapperuma told journalists that there was agreement by both sides not to give nomination to certain members this time.
The UPFA seniors were to have a meeting with the President last evening to sort out the final sticking points.(Kelum Bandara)
