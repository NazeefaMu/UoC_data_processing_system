President Maithripala Sirisena, who today inspected the Muthurajawela sanctuary, ordered the restriction of all kinds of activities including any construction and land fillings, which could result in the environment surrounding the sanctuary being destroyed, the President’s Media Unit said.

It said the President had also instructed that the permission granted by any state institution to carry out land fillings be rescinded and disciplinary action be taken against the state officials known to be aiding in actions which would result in the sanctuary being destroyed.

Recently there were several media reports on acts of environmental pollution occurring near Muthurajawala Sancturay which is a very important wetland in Sri Lanka. In view of these reports, the President undertook an observation visit to the sanctuary.

After the visit, the President held a special meeting with ministers, government officers, and security forces chiefs before issuing those instructions.

He also directed the officials to obtain legal advice to gazette these lands as wild life and environmental conservation regions and said even for a land with ownership deeds, permission should not be granted for construction or land filling, if there is an adverse effect on the environment.

The President instructed the IGP to provide special security through Special Task Force and erect barriers on the roads that lead to the wetlands and prevent acts of environmental pollution taking place near the sanctuary.
