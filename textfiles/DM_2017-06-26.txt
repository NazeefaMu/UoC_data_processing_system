Thousands of fighters to respond if Israel attacks: Hezbollah
	
BEIRUT AFP June23, 2017 
The head of Lebanese movement Hezbollah on Friday warned Israel against attacking Lebanon or Syria, saying hundreds of thousands of Arab and Muslim fighters would be ready to strike back. 
The Israeli enemy should know that if it launches an attack on Syria or Lebanon, its unknown whether the fighting will stay just between Lebanon and Israel, or Syria and Israel, Hassan Nasrallah said. 
Im not saying countries would intervene directly -- but it would open the door for hundreds of thousands of fighters from all around the Arab and Islamic world to participate in this fight -- from Iraq, Yemen, Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, he said.

Trump blames Obama over latest report on Russian election meddling
	

By Avi Selk, Amy B Wang  
c) 2017, The Washington Post June 25, 2017 - President Donald Trump on Saturday called out Obama administration officials for not taking stronger actions against Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election, contradicting his past statements and suggesting without proof that they were trying to help Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. His tweets came after The Post revealed Friday that the Obama White House had received reports as early as August 2016 regarding Russian President Vladimir Putins direct involvement in the cyber campaign with instructions to defeat or damage Clinton and help to elect Trump, according to sourcing deep inside the Russian government. 
Trump has long disputed that the Russians interfered with the election, calling it all a big Dem HOAX just this week.

A note to  my father,  Eric Cooray
	
Certain things are immeasurable and beyond definition. Love, for instance. Such things are however often recognisable, either in the joy or sorrow they create. 
And yet, there are instances when we dont see it at all or if we do, we call it something else. Theres love whose dimensions we dont fathom or even cannot fathom. The love of a father is something like that. 
Of course there are demonstrative fathers who shower their children with love; but even in such cases it is not easy to understand what exactly a father feels, what goes on in his mind, the quiet pleasures he experiences when his children do well and the great anxieties that torment him all the time. 
My father, who will complete yet another year of his exemplary life on earth on the 26th of June, was never demonstrative. 
In fact he was and still is loathe to express emotion. He never said much and even now appears to have a steady rein on his feelings. 


And yet, as the years passed, I have come to realise that he tirelessly strived in his own way to take care of his family and to make sure that his sons grew into strong men and responsible citizens. 
Today I know for certain that every word he spoke and everything he did were inspired by a vast ocean of love that he concealed from everyone. Indeed today I understand that even his silences and his restraint at times were inspired by love, caring and utmost generosity, all of which can only come from great wisdom about the world and about human beings. 
Although I had to wait until I became a father to understand what a fathers love truly is, it is not that I did not notice or appreciate his affections. I know this is also true of my brothers. Weve always had the greatest respect for our father. He is a simple, hard working man who is totally devoted to his family. He was born in Payagala, Kalutara - a township that has seen a lot of change in recent times, but still boasts of beautiful landscape. 


He attended Holy Cross College, Kalutara, an institution established in the late nineteenth century and is today one of the best schools in the district. He had shown much promise as a student but the early death of his father forced him to forego all options of higher education in order to take care of his family and ensure that his siblings could aspire to a better future. If he were to look back he would have no regrets; they all did well in the careers of their choice. 
Perhaps that early training in nurturing was what made him the exceptional parent he is. He is a man of few words and as many of us know a quiet parent can be quite intimidating. There were countless moments when his sons gave him ample reason to mete out harsh punishment, but that never happened. He would instead express displeasure with a keen, unwavering gaze which at times was more admonishment than a stinging slap. I recall that he showed an inexplicable fear of the sea and the railway track. I often told myself that it was unwarranted and silly of him, but now I realise with more than a tinge of shame that it was all about unfathomable love for his children.  He loved us all. He had no favourites. I still remember his response when the late Lalith Athulathmudali suggested that I be sent abroad for my studies. He said that he couldnt afford it and that it was wrong to privilege me over his other two sons. 


"This, then, is a poor tribute. My father, however, is wise and knows much. He will understand"

His life was his family. Everything he did and said revolved around creating a comfortable home and educating his children and seeing them do well. I have never heard him raise his voice to our mother. I have never seen him intoxicated. He educated us, as much as through the choices he made and the money he expended as by example. More by example, in fact. 
He taught us much but not in the manner of a teacher. He was kind and in his kindness taught us the virtues of empathy, generosity and responsibility. He was silent and in his silence he taught us the virtues of patience, restraint and also something of natural justice. 
He was loyal and thats how he taught us the virtues of loyalty. He had principles. He had strict principles and he believed that it is important for one to abide by these. He was never shaken by insults or by the wrongs done to him. He was, as I said, extremely patient. 
He never overreacted. He was a firm believer in natural justice. He never held grudges, he just couldnt be bothered. He never bad-mouthed anyone. He let things go and went on with his life. Thats how he taught us that it was not prudent to be angry, especially in the case of those who do not deserve our time and energy. We werent always good students but thats not his fault. He did his best. 


Everything he has said and done, as well as all the things he did not say and did not do, came to me in that moment. I recognised my father. I recognised how much he had given us, how much and how he had taught us, and most of all, that I will never be able to show him how grateful I am. He didnt say much and is still quite a silent man. I say so much and yet I feel he has been far more expressive and eloquent than I have been or can ever be. 
This, then, is a poor tribute. My father, however, is wise and knows much. He will understand.

British widow in SL seeks help to return home
	
A British woman has been left stranded in Sri Lanka after selling her home and marrying a Sri Lankan man who was shot dead, Daily Mail reported today.
The 59-year-old Diane De Zoysa says she gave 100,000 to 26-year-old husband Priyanjana when she moved to live with him in Ahungalla last year.
She had met the hotel worker when she was on holiday in the country six years ago, before returning seven months later to marry him.
However, her husband was tragically killed last month after being shot three times at a friend's house.
Mrs. De Zoysa says her husband was killed by men trying to blackmail him for money.
She has told the Daily Record that the killers thought he was a rich man as he had a nice house, a minibus and a tuk-tuk. He paid them but they wanted more she said.
'My husband and his family are very poor, so I have helped them. I gave up everything to join my husband here, she said.
She says she is now desperate to return to Scotland, but is unable to do so due to her financial situation.

Expanding beyond hotels, Vista Rooms partners with over 50 villa and apartment owners to deliver an
	
Vista Rooms, South Asias largest chain of affordable stays, is expanding operations to include apartments and villas in their portfolio of properties. Following a wave of success with standardizing and branding budget hotels across the island, Vista Rooms is now set to be a complete turnkey solutions provider for the private stays segment. They offer end to end support to villa and apartment owners  right from tech, to sales, to regulatory and operational support. This expansion into the informal tourism sector comes as the sector is experiencing a surge in popularity in recent years.
We are seeing a greater desire from tourists for more authentic stays. Travellers are seeking localized, personal experiences and apartments and villas are great alternatives to hotels that can help meet this need. Hence we are excited to move into this segment where we see a lot of potential for growth. We believe the key to unlocking this potential is in building trust with the customer by providing them with a quality stay. This is where our turnkey solutions will help hosts navigate the usual pitfalls of the hospitality industry, said Ankita Sheth, Vista Rooms Co-Founder.
Vista Rooms has already tied up with over 50 apartments and villas across the island and has begun providing an off the beaten path experience to tourists. This burgeoning segment is only set to grow further with the increase in global awareness of Sri Lanka as an excellent holiday destination thanks to a concerted push from the tourism board. Locals, too, find it easy to book a quick weekend getaway with Vista Rooms.
We work on a franchise or a complete turnkey model with property owners where we offer our brand, technology and sales network in serving global travellers. Our property owners have on average seen their occupancy increase by 15-20% in the first 3 months of operations by accessing our global distribution network of over 100 online and offline travel agents, corporates and repeat customers said Vista Rooms Co-Founder, Amit Damani
Vista Rooms follows an asset and people-light model. Having opened operations in Sri Lanka in March 2016, Vista Rooms has already built the largest network of branded stays in the country with over 300 properties across 25 cities. The same swift growth can be expected from the brand going forward, as they begin catering to a large, untapped demand segment. The online startup believes that their technological prowess, the ability to offer good quality, standardized experiences and stellar customer service will uplift the segment and create greater demand.

Gammanpila refutes spy charges
	
Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) General Secretary Udaya Gammanpila today rejected allegations made by Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) that he acted as a spy for ex-president Mahinda Rajapaksa when he was a member of the JHU.
However, he said there was another member of the JHU who turned out to be a spy.
An Intelligence Officer who joined the anti-terrorism movement in 1998 grew close to JHU Secretary Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka. This person joined the JHU Central Committee and was appointed to a higher rank by the minister. The minister couldnt figure out this Intelligence Officer till 2015. When there was an official spy moving very close to the minister, whats the need for me to be a spy, MP Gammanpila told a news conference.
He said Pivithuru Hetak Udesa Jathika Sabawa Chairperson Ven. Athuraliye Rathana Thera visited him on November 12, 2014 and revealed that minister Maithripala Sirisena at that time had agreed to run for Presidency.
This was ten days before Mr. Sirisena announced that he would contest for presidential election on November 22. I promised Ven. Rathana Thera to keep the information he revealed to me as a secret. Had I been a spy for Rajapaksa, this would have been my golden ticket to success, he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) rejected the President Maithripala's statement on SAITM and vowed to continue its struggle.
After talking to GMOA representatives, the president's office said in a statement that SAITM was instructed to stop enrolling new students until the government issued the gazette notice stipulating the standards to be adopted for private medical education.
GMOA's newly-appointed Secretary Haritha Aluthge told a news conference that they were in no way agreeable to legalizing SAITM in any form. He said the only option was to nationalise it.
He said they believed that Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne had intervened alter the agreement reached at the meeting with the President.
Instead of abolishing SAITM, the statement paves the way to legalise it, Dr. Aluthge said.
He said the GMOA and the students union demanded that SAITM be abolished or nationalised.
The President told us to believe his word and call off the strike. We respected his word and had hoped he will mete out justice. We are looking forward to his explanation. He should correct the contradictions if we are to stop any further action, Dr. Aluthge said.
Meanwhile, he warned that the next couple of hours would be crucial and the GMOA will continue its strike and under no circumstances would they stop their trade union action until the government ends the SAITM issue and safeguards the patients' right to live and the future of the medical sector.

Govt. to shut diplomatic missions
	
Several Sri Lankan Missions abroad including some of those in Europe would be closed down soon, Minister of Foreign Affairs Ravi Karunanayake said yesterday.
He was explaining the Government's plans to make changes in its diplomatic mechanism.
He said it would be done after assessing the performance and looking at the rationale behind keeping these missions.
Minister Karunanayake, who came up with this information at a media briefing yesterday morning said some Sri Lankan diplomatic missions in Europe would have to be closed down in the future.
We will have to close down some missions as those have found to be of no use lately," the Minister said
He said performance of all diplomatic mission heads would be assessed before making a final decision.
The Government has decided to go for commercial based diplomacy and link to the world through establishing commercial based diplomatic ties with various countries across the globe," he added
Further the minister said
Heads of all Sri Lankan diplomatic missions have been called for a meeting with the President and the Prime Minister on September 4 to brief them about the new policy, he said.
He said three diplomatic heads had been already recalled.
However, the Minister refrained from divulging as who these mission heads were.
We are not in a position to reveal the names of these diplomatic heads yet, he added.
Meanwhile, Mr. Karunanayake said only one person with vested interests was shouting against the Governments move to put the National Lotteries Board under his purview.
They may be shouting as I managed to turn the National Lotteries Board into a profit making venture, which was hit by financial losses, he said.
There have been instances where the Mahapola was under the Ministry of National Security during the time of late Lalith Athulathmudali and the National Lotteries Board was under the purview of Ministry of Science and Technology in the past.
However a great din is made when the National Lotteries Board was placed under the purview of my Ministry, he added. (Yohan Perera)

Group of Sri Lankan boatpeople sent home
	
A plane chartered by the Australian Department of Immigration and Border Protection has left the Australian territory early yesterday with about 20 people  some of them guards and interpreters  onboard, The Australian reported..
The Sri Lankan nationals were led up the steps of the plane with a guard on each side.
The return of Sri Lankans from Christmas Island to Colombo overnight on a government charter jet has fuelled speculation that Australian Border Force has intercepted a suspected asylum vessel in the past week.
Christmas Island residents yesterday linked the deportations to an unusual spectacle last Thursday when two of the navys rigid inflatable vessels were seen towing a small boat close to the horizon.
The last known intercept of an asylum vessel on its way to Australia was in March.
The March monthly update on the departments website stated: During this period, Australian authorities worked with the government of Sri Lanka to return 25 people who were detected and intercepted attempting to reach Australia illegally by boat, in accordance with Australias protection obligations.
A spokesman for Immigration Minister Peter Dutton yesterday declined to confirm any new intercept.
The Sri Lankan government has been willing for some years to swiftly take back failed asylum-seekers stopped en route to Australia.
During the sustained wave of boats between 2008 and 2013, Christmas Island sometimes held more than 6000 immigration detainees.
It now operates one detention centre with fewer than 1000 men, but many of them are not asylum-seekers. Instead, the centre has become a place to hold mostly men who are citizens of other countries and have committed crimes while living in Australia. Once their jail term ends, they are transferred to immigration detention to await deportation.

## Title: Holy month of Ramadhan, when gates of heaven are open

Holy month of Ramadhan, when gates of heaven are open
	
On the last day of Shabaan (ie. the eighth month of the Islamic calendar) Muslims the world over go on looking at the moon in the sky to ascertain the Maghrib time, when they should start a month-long fast from dawn till dusk abstaining from several things including food and drink. 
Origin of Ramadhan 
Ramadhan is the name of the ninth month in the Islamic calendar. In Arabic Ramadhan means intense heat, scorched ground and food scarcity. It is considered the most venerated and blessed month in the Islamic year. Prayers, sawm (fasting), charity and self accountability are prevalent during this month. 
Rulings regarding fasting

It is obligatory for the fasting person to confirm his or her intention before the appearance of Fajr. The intention should come from the bottom of the heart. One should make his or her heart intention before going to sleep and should get up early with that intention and start fasting at the dawn of the day. 

Time for breaking fast 
The time for breakfast is Maghrib or the time of sun set. When one hears the call for Maghrib Prayer or the fourth prayer of the day it is the time to breakfast. The Prophet used to break fast with fresh dates before praying. If fresh dates were not available he would eat some dried dates and if even dried dates were not available he would have a few sips of water. 
Feeding the poor 
According to Islam, combining fasting with feeding the poor is one of the means of reaching paradise. It is said that there are transparent rooms in Paradise. Allah has prepared them for those who feed the poor, who are gentle in speech, who fast regularly and who pray at night while the other people are asleep. 
The Prophet said Anyone who gives food to a fasting person to break his fast will have a reward equal to his. As narrated by al Bukhaari 6: Muslim 2308 The messenger of Allah was the most generous during Ramadhan when Angel Jibreel met him. He met him each night and revised the Quran with him. The messenger of Allah was more generous than the blowing of the wind. 
Zakaat 
Zakaat is what is left after meeting ones necessities from the earnings of the Islamic calendar year. Those who can afford pay year to year basis and can be paid at any time of the year but during the month of Ramadhan. 
Ramadan is a period when Muslims slow down from worldly affairs and focus on self reformation, spiritual cleansing and Enlightenment, establishing a link between Almighty God and themselves by prayer, supplication, charity, good deeds, kindness and helping others. 
Since Ramadhan is a special month, Muslims in many parts of the world consume favourite foods during this month. Since Ramadhan emphasizes communality aspects of family members, relatives, friends and well wishers etc. to take dinner together. Some Muslims invite one another to share the evening meal after breakfast. However, some Muslims eat less even during the night, during the Ramadan period due to stomach contraction. Even if they eat less for dinner they experience less fatigue during the day when they engage in fast as they become used to the altered routine soon, before the end of the first week of fasting. 
Events of Ramadhan 
Two days in the month of Ramadhan are of special significance. One of them is the day on which the Qurans first verse was revealed at mid night. This night called Laylat-al-Qudr is known only to God and Muhammad. Indication has been made by Muhammad that it is one of the last ten odd nights of the month of Ramadhan. The other occasion for celebration is the ending of the fasting period. Ramadhan fasting period ends on the last day of the month of Ramadhan with the sight of another new moon.
Virtues of fasting 
Fasting makes the soul shine. It invigorates and enlivens it from its lethargic state. Excessive eating makes one blind and dark just as excessive water destroys crops. Excessive eating makes a man dull and deprives him of the power of thinking. A hungry belly is, however, a fountain of wisdom. This has been the experience of many pious divines. The practice of fasting creates the taste of prayer. A dull belly can never taste the sweetness of prayer and invocations. 
Rewards for fasting 
Every action of the son of Adam is rewarded in many ways, each good deed receiving ten times its like up to seven hundred times. 
There is a gate of Paradise called ar-Rayyann. On the day of drinks and closed after the last of them enters it and whoever drinks will never become thirsty (Ibn Khusai mahSaheeh)

Id-ul-Fitr, festival of charity
	
Islam, as a religion, caters to everything good in society. It not only directs man on how to worship his creator and sustainer and obey him but also changes his behaviour and attitudes as regards his celebrations. 
Before the advent of Islam, Arabs used to celebrate certain days and occasions in an uncivilised way, indulging in drinking, gambling and adultery. But after Prophet Muhammad, Islam changed that barbaric society and introduced a civilised, refined and cultured way of celebrating. 
The aim of Id-ul-Fitr is to introduce a cultured form of celebration that offers the following benefits to mankind. 
Id-ut-Fitr gives the true picture of social equality, when all the Muslims irrespective of caste, creed and colour, wealth and position gather together and bow down before Allah the Almighty. The only greatness in their mind is the greatness of Allah, which they utter with their tongues. 
Allah is the Most Great, Allah is the Most Great. None is worthy to be worshipped besides Allah. And (I again declare) Allah is the Most Great. Allah is the Most Great. 
On this happy occasion a Muslim does not forget the poor, charity which is the form of Sadakathul Fitr (Commonly known as Fitra) is compulsory for all Muslims, who have an adequate amount of wealth as described in Islamic Law. 


"On this happy occasion a Muslim does not forget the poor, charity which is the form of Sadakathul Fitr (Commonly known as Fitra) is compulsory for all Muslims, who have an adequate amount of wealth as described in Islamic Law"

Id-ul-Fitr is the occasion to demonstrate self-discipline and moral consciousness earned through the devotional exercises of fasting during the Holy Month of Ramadhan. 
To achieve real success in all circumstances in life a disciplined moral-self is indispensable. The day of Id is the starting point of that disciplined life which was fashioned as a result of the rigid sustained devotion in the form of fasting. 
At this point we must comprehend that social and spiritual bliss cannot be achieved without a strong inner conviction. Honesty cannot be advocated for others if we cannot practice it ourselves. 
Love and affection cannot be strengthened if we ourselves cannot practice it. The Muslims are those who believe in the commands of Allah and do service to others. 
The fasting teaches us to solve our daily problems and to learn to adjust our system to reduce hunger, poverty, and discomfort so prevalent in our community. 
Let us therefore, on this important and significant occasion return to this natural and purified state in which God created us. 
Let us from this day, maintain this state free from sins, so that we can truly withstand evil and destructive temptations that are ruining mankind. 
Thus, Id-ul-Fitr conveys the message of social equality, charity to the poor and self-discipline to all mankind irrespective of their social status and ethnic origins. At this juncture it is our profound duty as true Muslims to transmit these values to other nations. 
May Allah guide us to achieve these noble aims and grant us the good of this world and the good in the hereafter.

Mahela denies speculation on Indian coach
	
Former Sri Lankan captain Mahela Jayawardane has denied speculation that he is looking for the role of head coach of the Indian team.
Mahela said in a twitter message that he was not looking at full-time positions right now.
Flattered by speculation linking me to India coaching job but I am not looking at full-time positions right now. I am completely focused on current commitments with Mumbai Indians and Khulna, he tweeted.
Jayawardene has worked as a batting consultant of the England team before he took Mumbai Indians to Indian Premier League (IPL) 10 title glory earlier this year.
This was his first season as a coach of the IPL franchise.

Flattered by speculation linking me to India coaching job but I am not looking at full-time positions right now.

Mahela 'still short of experience' to coach SL: Sumathipala
	
Mahela Jayawardene is still short of experience to take over as head coach of Sri Lanka national team after the exit of Graham Ford, Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) President Thilanga Sumathipala said.
"Mahela is still short of experience as a senior coach, he may be good as a T20 batting or a fielding coach," Sumathipala told the local radio station.
He said the Mumbai Indians' coach and former Sri Lankan captain has also some of his playing day contemporaries in the current national side.
Jayewardene, who retired in 2014 after a glittering international career, is regarded as one of the best cricketing brains.
His and his close mate Kumar Sangakkara's retirements at the same time hurt Sri Lanka badly. The Lankan side have lost consistently since the two seniors retired. The team has plummeted in all ICC rankings since then.
Graham Ford, who was the coach only for one year, decided to quit this week reportedly due to differences of opinion with Sumathipala's management.
Sri Lanka has had some nine interim and permanent coaches since 2011.
SLC sources said they were mulling approaching Chandika Hathurusinghe, the current Bangladeshi coach to take over. But his contract with the Bangladeshis will only end in 2019.
The former New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming, his team mate Scott Styris and Tom Moody, who was previously the head coach, are the names being floated around as likely successor to Ford. (island-cricket)

Mosul celebrates first Eid without Islamic State in years
	

REUTERS, 25th JUNE, 2017
People in the Iraqi city of Mosul celebrated their first Muslim Eid holiday without Islamic State in years on Sunday after the militants were ejected from much of the city, and hoped the battle to recapture the remaining area would soon be over. Children gathered in squares on the eastern side of the city. Some played on old swings and others with toy guns and rifles, which were among the toys allowed by Islamic State militants after they took over the city in June 2014.
The militants implemented an extreme version of Islam which associated toys with a face, like dolls, with idolatry. They encouraged youngsters to train on weapons and changed text books to reflect their military ideology. Children were asked to add up bombs or bullets in math exercises. Eid prayers were allowed under Islamic State but festivities were not.
But for many, Sundays Eid celebrations were overshadowed by the destruction of their historic leaning minaret, blown up by the militants on Wednesday, and fears for thousands of civilians trapped in the Old City in western Mosul still under Islamic State control.
It wont be real Eid before we return home, said a man in his sixties, displaced from the western side of the city, across the Tigris river, where fighting continues.

MR given protocol assistance against circular
	
In contravention of the circulars pertaining to the politicians visiting foreign countries, the Foreign Ministry had given instruction to the Sri Lankan Embassy in Japan to accord protocol assistance and courtesies to former President Mahinda Rajapaksa during his recent private visit to Japan, it is learnt.
Sri Lanka Ambassador in Japan Dhammika Ganganath Dissanayake in a reply to a query by President Maithripala Sirisena had stated that he had to follow the instructions of the Foreign Ministry in this regard.
Explaining the circumstances that led to the according of protocol assistance and courtesies to the former President and his entourage during a private visit by them, the ambassador said that he received a fax message from the Foreign Ministry on May 29 informing him to accord protocol assistance and other courtesies to former President and his 12 member delegation on their arrival, stay and departure, citing two circulars.
However, as the only circular that dealt with the private visits by politicians had said that the protocol assistance and other courtesies could be accorded only to the President, Prime Minister, Speaker of the Parliament, Chief Justice, Cabinet Ministers, Opposition Leader and the State Ministers, the ambassador said he sought further clarification and instructions from the foreign ministry.
He had also cited to the Ministry the fact that the instructions given by the Ministry during a visit to Japan by Mr. Rajapaksa in 2016 had differed from the latest instructions.
Mr. Dissanayake had informed the President that since he had not received any more instructions embassy provided protocol assistance to the former President and his entourage only at the arrival, departure and with Japanese customs.(Dayaseeli Liyanage)

SLC in talks with three coaches
	
Within hours after the official announcement of Graham Fords resignation, Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) is talking with three different coaches to finalise any one of them to be the Head Coach.
This was revealed by the President of SLC Thilanga Sumathipala yesterday.
The post is now vacant following Graham Ford stepping down 15 months working with the team, though his contract was till the 2019 World Cup.
We are talking to three others, Sumathipala, said speaking over telephone.
For obvious reasons, he did not name them, but admitted, Chandika Hathurusinghe is not available. Gurusinha wants Hathuru but he is not available.
Sumathipala also made it clear that the captain or any senior members of the team will have no say in the selection of the coach. They will not be consulted.
Apparently, no direct approach to Hathuru, who is attached with the Bangladesh side is made yet.
umathipala also defended the decision to bring Asanka Gurusinha from Australia. Ford is believed to have had expressed his displeasure over Asankas involvement with the team.
However, Sumathipala said, Asanka Gurusinha is not a coach. He is in charge of the team, coordinating with the support staff, selectors, players, High Performance and SLC Board. He was brought in (from Australia) because we want a winning team, he further added.
So, If everything goes according to the new plan, both teams-Sri Lanka and India- may have a new coach for the home series commencing in Sri Lanka next month.(Bipin Dani)

Solution to solid waste disposal through Korean Technology
	
The Megapolis and the Western Development Ministry is to introduce a Metro Colombo Solid Waste Management Project (MCSWMP) through which it intends to carry out Sanitary Land Fills with Korean technology as a safe and sustainable solution to the solid waste disposal to the entire country.
Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka told the media today that Cabinet approval had been granted to the US$.125 million (Rs.19 billion) project of which solid waste, treated and compressed into blocks at a plant in Kelaniya will be transported by train to Aruwakkalu in Puttalam to fill huge abandoned pits of limestones which had been used for decades to excavate lime for the Puttalam Cement Factory.
We will provide a long term sustainable solid waste management system that is socially acceptable, environmentally friendly and economically feasible, Minister Ranawaka stressed.
The project would envisage to develop the worked-out limestone quarries in Aruwakkalu, Puttalam into a Sanitary Landfill for disposal of solid waste generated in Colombo with waste transfer, using rail transportation from Colombo to the proposed Sanitary Landfill.
Solid waste collected from Colombo Metropolitan area, Dehiwala  Mt- Lavinia MC, Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte MC and Kolonnawa UC area will be used for disposal at the initial stage of the project and will be expanded to cover other municipalities and cities.
The extent of Sanitary Land Fill site at Aruwakkalu was 45 acres and the transfer station at Kelaniya was about 8.4 acres. The Aruwakkalu site could be expandable further if need arose since no families or houses were located near the site.
Two trains daily from Kelaniya to Aruwakkalu would transport 1,200 metric tons of compressed blocks of solid waste in 13 rail wagons and 26 containers of 20 foot in each train
Minister Ranawaka said the Project had been approved by the Cabinet. Feasibility study and conceptual design had been successfully completed. Bidding documents or Request for proposal had been prepared based on 'Design and Build Contract'.
I expect the support and cooperation of the public, all political parties and officials for the success of this project as solid waster disposal has become a national issue today. The political forces have aggravated the problem as politicians of all political parties have used this problem for their political agenda. If you produce solid waste you have no right to oppose the manner in which a Local Government body disposes the garbage, Minister Ranawaka said.
He added that if there were protests to that project his ministry would give up the project and as a result the country and the people would suffer for ever. (Sandun A Jayasekera)
