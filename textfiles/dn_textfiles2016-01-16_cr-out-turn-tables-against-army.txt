CR out to turn tables against Army

Unpredictable CR and FC will battle it out with the favourites Army in their inter club 'A' division Dialog rugby league tournament second round match at the Army grounds in Diyagama at 4 pm today.
CR and FC is completely struck by injuries for some of their important players such as ex Trinity Lion and National under19 captain and fly half Tharinda Ratwatte (due to illness), national under 19 player Supun Warnakulasuriya (knee injury), winger Anuradha Herath (shoulder injury) and hooker Malith Hettiarachchi (finger injury) will not play in today's game.
The injured will be replaced by fly half Ashan de Costa, prop Nipuna Devinda, forward Kokila Hiran, winger Sashan Mohamad and hooker Lahiru Pavithra.
Also ex Dharmaraja College skipper cum full back Rochana Hettiarachchi is down with a knee injury and will be replaced by Prince Chamara who will play in his pet position as full back.
Going by the team cards Army is having a huge advantage over the inexperienced young CR and FC side, but they are going in to this game as the underdogs, hence on their day CR can taste victory by toppling any side.
CR and FC (Probable XV) Shane Sambandapperuma, Lahiru Pavithra, Nipuna Devinda, Ishan Noor (captain), Dilanka Perera, Sasanka Ariyaratna, Kokila Hiran, Arun Kumar, Kavindu de Costa and Ashan de Costa, Sashan Mohamad, Kanchana Ramanayaka, Amila Bandara, Kavindu Perera, Prince Chamara
