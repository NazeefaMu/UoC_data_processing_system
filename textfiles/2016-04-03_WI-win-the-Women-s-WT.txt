West Indies women created history in the 2016 World T20 as they defeated Australia by eight wickets to register their maiden title and deny Australia the chance to win their fourth consecutive title.

Australia women won the toss and chose to bat at the Eden Gardens and led by fifties from skipper Meg Lanning (52) and Elyse Vilani (52), they notched up 148/5 in 20 overs.

Chasing a tricky 149, Hayley Matthews and Stafanie Taylor started off aggressively as they took the attack to the Australian bowlers. Matthews notched up an aggressive fifty off 34 balls as the opening partnership put West Indies on course.

The 120-run stand was broken when Matthews was caught by Alex Blackwell off Kristen Beams for 66. With 14 needed off the last two overs, DeandraDottin slammed two boundaries off Rene Farrell. With five runs needed, Taylor cut Farrell straight to point to depart for 59. With three runs needed off the last over, Britney Cooper got West Indies over the line thanks to an overthrow to set off celebrations in the West Indies camp.

This win continues a golden 2016 for West Indies. Earlier in the year, the U-19 team won the World Cup by defeating India in Dhaka.
