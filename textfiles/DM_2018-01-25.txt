A lot of people in Colombo are sensible :Pradip Jayewardene Sri Lanka Freedom Party
	
The upcoming Local Government Elections will see new faces entering the political scene. Representing the J. R Jayewardene clan from the Cinnamon Gardens Ward for the Colombo Municipal Council is his grandson Pradip Jayewardene. Although J.RJ was known to be a strongman of the Green Party, Pradip will be contesting under the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) ticket. 
In a candid interview with the Daily Mirror, Jayewardene shared his thoughts as to why he is contesting from the Blue Party and his plans for Colombo. 
Following are excerpts of the interview done with Jayewardene. 
The reason not to contest from the UNP is because I didnt have an opportunity since the passing away of Gamini Dissanayake. I worked closely with Gamini Dissanayake during his election campaign
	The Parliamentary system should be developed under a monarchy. Therefore the system cannot be directly applied to the rest of the world although we have done that
	I have already helped a large waste-to-energy project with all the approvals which will take 700 metric tonnes of waste in Colombo to be converted to energy
Q The name J.R Jayewardene and the UNP are interconnected. By contesting from the SLFP arent you betraying your grandfather
I think J.R Jayewardene is now beyond UNP. In fact when he came to power and when he became President he made several statements saying that he will look at the country above party and politics. Of course he had to work for the party, but he made a clear distinction between the work of the party and the work of the President. His greatest work was achieved as President. The reason not to contest from the UNP is because I didnt have an opportunity since the passing away of Gamini Dissanayake. I worked very closely with Gamini Dissanayake during his election campaign. Unfortunately he was killed. After that I realized that the UNP no longer had correct leadership. I watched what was happening with the UNP and realized that they are not heading in the correct direction. They were no longer subscribing to the mission and views of my grandfather. My grandfather had a very clear understanding of the nation, what our sovereignty is and what our country is. He had clear views on the open economy, but he also knew that we need to preserve our sovereignty and independence and give not only our political independence, but economic independence as well. He had a very strong socialist side to him. He was the head of the Democratic Socialist republic of Sri Lanka. For foreigners, democracy and socialism are two different things because people are polarized, but he saw the blend of democracy and socialism. But the current UNP is not that at all. 
Q You pledged to defeat the proposed new constitution. Is it because it almost contradicts 1977 Constitution by JRJ
No, it has nothing to do with the JRJ Constitution. I believe that its the only Constitution that has worked in the post-Independence history. It has proven itself over 40 years. There has been continuous growth except for one year when there was a power crisis due to the mismanagement of the situation. Other than that year we have had continuous growth and stability and we have been able to defeat one of the worlds most ruthless terrorist organisations. I believe that a lot of it had to do with the Presidential system. I saw how my grandfather spoke to the CNN when President Premadasa was assassinated. He said he was very sad about the death, but he also said that the country will survive because the Constitution allows the Prime Minister to take the seat of the President which is a full presidency with full powers. 
Q The Executive Presidential system has created doubts in most politicians. Recently the President too consulted the Supreme Court regarding his term of office. Is it a necessary requirement for a country like Sri Lanka
I think its absolutely necessary because the Parliamentary system of governance is not our system of rule. It was something developed in England under a monarchy which was then trans-located to Sri Lanka. The Parliamentary system should be developed under a monarchy. Therefore the system cannot be directly applied to the rest of the world although we have done that. I believe that the Presidential system is a mustand if we dont have such a system we will have enormous instability. 
Q What are the major issues you have identified in Colombo and what are your solutions
Traffic is a major concern that we have to deal with. There are many initiatives been taken, but what we are implementing are engineers solutions to this problem. A wider road or a flyover is only a temporary solution. The more you expand the road it is highly likely that that stretch of the road would be used more. Therefore more vehicles will travel. We therefore need to have transit systems and reduce incentives for people entering Colombo. Another important aspect to consider is the parking facility. I have heard of parking metres along the Kollupitiya side, but I have never seen them and they charge you on an hourly basis which I believe is a good move. We are looking at some areas which could be used for dual purposes. 
Walking areas are another one of my concerns. People seem to be using them a lot and it would reduce the cost of parking as well. If there is an opportunity for one person to go on his morning walk, do some shopping and walk back home it would be less time consuming than having to be stuck in traffic. We are looking at ways to link Independence Square, Nelum Pokuna, Viharamahadevi Park, Beira Lake, Galle Face and Fort. 
Another aspect is the zoning of Colombo. A new way of looking at zoning in a community is that you must have residences, businesses, shops and recreation areas integrated. In Colombo people are breaking zoning rules and trying new ways to get businesses into residential areas. Theres a huge issues with commercial ventures popping up in residential areas which cause huge problems to residents. This has to be resolved using new ways of zoning. 
I have already helped a large waste-to-energy project with all the approvals which will take 700 metric tonnes of waste in Colombo to be converted to energy. I did this during the past three years even before I entered active politics. It will significantly reduce the garbage problem in the city because almost 50% of the waste will go into this project and the second and the third phase will also follow the same model. 
Q Has the new electoral system become a challenge and a barrier for a newcomer like you
I think its good for us because we are canvassing in a Ward and its a manageable size. You can meet a lot of residents and you can understand issues that they face. It is a more hands-on approach. We also dont need to spend a lot on massive media campaigns. It has also increased the number of representatives. 
Q People dont have much hopes on politicians today. Where did the political system go wrong
People do have an idea that politics is bad and that theres a lot of corruption. There has been a lot of media exposure on corruption and abuse of power. Its not the Proportional Representation (PR) system that was wrong. It was the distortion of the PR system. Although the PR system worked on a district each MP had an electorate assigned and he was supposed to work there and win his electorate. The party made a list of candidates and gave priority to it. Therefore some people will relax while others will work hard.Then somebody came up with a very simple solution to allow everybody to run for the entire district and whoever gets elected could come on top. Therefore each candidate now had a challenge to campaign an entire electorate and get more exposure. For this they needed money and they got money from whoever who gave them. So those in the illegal alcohol trade, the drug trade and other illegal businesses gave them money. In the second round, these people who gave money to the politicians thought why they should be paying and going after them. In turn they started contesting, spending their own money on themselves. This also brought in the actors, TV stars because they already had a profile on TV. 
Q Colombo is UNPs stronghold and even your grandfather entered politics from Colombo. Dont you think it is a disadvantage for you to contest from the SLFP
Yes. Thats why I have taken up the challenge. But a lot of people in Colombo are also sensible and I expect them to think outside of party politics and vote for someone who would actually do something for the country and also represent them.

Dubai seeks extradition of two Lankans for roommate's murder
	
The Dubai public prosecution is taking necessary legal action to seek extradition of two Sri Lankans, who killed their counterpart after they were apparently duped by him and fled the country.
Recently, the operations room of the Dubai Police received a call informing them about foul smell emanating from a room in a villa in Al Badda area. The police officials swung into action and immediately rushed to the site. They met the caller, N.A, who stays in a room of the same villa, which is shared by a number of tenants.
The man said that he left for his job at 6am and on his return around 7.30pm, he felt the foul smell. The police found the door of the room locked. When it was opened, they found a decomposed body of a man - in his fifties - and bloodstains that had dried up. The man had been stabbed in his chest and stomach. The police also found a blood-stained knife in the kitchen.
The primary probe of forensic experts showed that the victim was killed a few days before his body was discovered.
An extensive investigation was launched. It was found that nine days before the incident, a Sri Lankan, identified as S. Sh, had rented the accommodation to two persons - J.O and S.F- after he was approached by a woman - B.M. The victim shared the room with the duo.
The police identified the first 1suspect J.O and S.F as his accomplice. The woman - B.M - told the police that J.O was her friend as he had offered her work in a cleaning company. She said J.O and S.F had taken the room on rent and were living there with the victim.
She explained that there was a dispute between the two suspects, who came on a visit visa, with the victim. The duo gave Dh 6,000 each to the deceased to get them residence visas. However, the victim did not do so, despite repeated pursuance. He also did not return them the money.
The woman told the cops that when the visit visa of the two suspects was about to expire, they might have had an argument, which led to the murder.
The suspects escaped after stealing the victim's belongings - including gold jewellery. They fled the country a few hours after committing the crime. (Khaleej Times)

Gazette allowing unlimited foreign loans detrimental to SL: Bandula
	
The government was getting ready to issue a Gazette titled Active Liability Management Gazette which would grant the finance minister the power to raise unlimited foreign loans exceeding even the borrowings mentioned in the 2018 budget, MP Bandula Gunawardane said yesterday.
Addressing a media briefing, he said if the proposed gazette was issued it would be detrimental to the country, adding that it had not been approved by parliament.
The incumbent government has obtained approximately Rs.3 trillion as foreign loans since 2105 to date. During the tenure of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, foreign loans worth Rs.7 trillion were obtained. It seems that the current government is stagnating and has been unable to repay its loans. Therefore the country would have to face a huge debt burden if this gazette is issued and more loans are received, he warned.
He said they were willing to even go to the Supreme Court in order to seek its interpretation with regard to the gazette notification. (Sheain Fernandopulle)

The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) today warned it would resort to a countrywide work stoppage on Tuesday (30) if the government fails to provide a reasonable solution to their issues in the coming days.
GMOA Assistant Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge told a news conference that they had reached to this decision following the unanimous approval of its Executive Committee.
He also said they would launch the work stoppage starting from 8 am on Tuesday, protesting over several issues affecting the medical professionals as well as the country including the SAITM issue and curtailment of medical officers allowances.
We have informed the Health Ministry Secretary about these issues and no positive response have been made with this regard. Accordingly, the work stoppage will be mandatory if these authorities fail to announce their decision before Tuesday, he added.
While condemning the assault on GMOA executive member outside the polling centre of the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) on Wednesday, Dr. Aluthge said they would take maximum legal measures with this regard.

Indiscipline  in Sri Lanka deflates cyclist Chens ambition
	
Cyclist Chen Ming Hsien (Albert Chen) of Taiwan, who has a mission to ride across the world is in Sri Lanka! Chens intention is to enter his name in the Guinness Book of World Records. He also intends to popularize environmental and cultural protection whilst promoting peace among people. Up to now he has cycled in 23 countries. Professionally he is hotelier and a director of a school. Chen who is 67-years-oldwas presented with the award for the Best Teacher in1995 in Taiwan. He has cycled six timesaround Taiwan between2008  2011. Following are excerpts of aninterview the Daily Mirror did with Chen.
Q What made you to accept a challenge of cycling around the world with the intention of entering your name in the Guinness Book of World Records
I was hospitalized for a serious operation in 2007. Whilst lying in the hospital bed, without much hopes to live, I prayed to God for my recovery. I made a promise that I would cycle round Taiwan once I am discharged from the hospital. My prayers were answered and in 2008 I fulfilled my promise to God. 
Q How many countries has your cycling taken you to What are the other countries you intend to visit after Sri Lanka.
I started cycling around the world in 2012 and cycled in China, Israel, Vatican, Italy, France, England, Holland, Belgium, and Germany. In 2013 I was in Brussels and Korea, in 2014 in Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, and Philippine, in 2015 Africa and Switzerland, and in 2016 I once again cycled around China. In 2017 I was in Cambodia, Thailand, Myanmar, India and Sri Lanka. In 2018 I intend cycling in Nigeria and Australia and also intend in coming back to Sri Lanka. In 2019 my plans are to ride in America, Texas, Canada, Japan and to enter China. 
Q At your age, it is not an easy task to cycle the entire world. How long have you been cycling now
Though I am 67 I am young at heart. I believe in myself and my successes give me immense satisfaction. With a positive mindset nothing is impossible. This is the background to my cycling around the world which began in 2012. 
I was hospitalized for a serious operation in 2007. Whilst lying in the hospital bed, without much hopes to live, I prayed to God for my recovery. I made a promise that I would cycle round Taiwan once I am discharged from the hospital.
Q Can you recall some memorable incidents that took place in other countries
I met with an accident for the first time in Israel. It was so serious and everybody thought I would have died on the spot. There was Gods hand during this incident and I was miraculously rescued sans a scratch on my body. Holland is the best country I have visited so far. They are very systematic and the place is very safe. The people are friendly and helpful. Life is very easy and people in this country are free of stress.
 
Q What are the responses you have got in this endeavour
I receive a lot of response and I am surprised to note how people identify me. They encourage me and are becoming very friendly. I have pleasant memories in many of these countries. I receive generous sponsorship. The Catholic Association of Taiwan is an extra special sponsor of mine. 
Q Once this challenge is completed, what will be your future aspirations
My next mission is to form a youth circle that would love the environment and the globe. As of now, unprecedented pollution is taking place in every form in the globe. We also live in a risky world. I will get humans, specially the young blood, to think far and to implement the go greener concept. 
Q Where did you ride in Sri Lanka
Traffic congestion coupled with not complying with traffic rules has stopped me from cycling in Sri Lanka. I was not able to set my mind for the purpose. I had plans to ride to Galle and Kandy, but it may be during my next visit to Sri Lanka. If I had a companion to cycle with it would have been different. 
Q What are the memories you would carry back from Sri Lanka
Friendship and beautiful memories of kind hospitality. I appreciate Mrs Sunethra Nugawela, Executive Director Academy for Administrative Professionals, and her family for the lovely gestures and making my short stay pleasant. I would also like to thank Captain Lee of Evergreen for sponsoring my accommodation. These wonderful people have given me hopes of visiting Sri Lanka again.

## Title: Interim order for Gota extended till Feb. 15

Interim order for Gota extended till Feb. 15
	
The Court of Appeal today further extended the Interim Order till February 15, preventing the FCID from acting on Certificate (B Report) under the offences against the Public Property Act in the Magistrates Court against former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa.
The Bench comprising Justices P.Padman Surasena (President/CA) and Shiran Gooneratne fixed submissions to be resumed on February 14 on the question of extension of the Interim Order.
When the matter was taken up yesterday, Romesh de Silva PC submitted that it is a question whether to extend the Interim Order and he maintained that the Interim Order granted was a comprehensive one.
He submitted that the case of the petitioner is prima facie and the Court had issued notices and granted Interim Order.
He pointed out now the court has to consider balance of Convenience (the question is to balance the relief given to the party against the injury that will be done to it in light of the harm it would do to him/her) whether to extend the Interim Order given.
He said there was a purpose of mala fide (in bad faith; with intent to deceive) intention to arrest or remand the petition and that granting Interim Order mandatory and is the inherent power of the Court.
He said there was no application to stay the proceedings in the Magistrates Court and there was mala fide intention to arrest him and his liberty was at stake.
He asked court not to arrest him or remand him but did not ask not to indict if the Attorney General thinks there were grounds.
He contended the construction of the D.A. Rajapakse memorial and museum was a civil matter and there was no criminal breach of trust and the petitioner had no misappropriated money but they want to remand him on misappropriation.
He added there was no request made to stop the investigation or indictment and that the petitioner had instructed the Sri Lanka Land Reclamation Corporation to undertake construction from outside on contract.
When the matter came up on December 15 last year Senior Deputy Solicitor General brought to the cognizance of the Court that at the time the matter was taken up for Interim Order, the Respondent Attorney General was not heard and the ex parte Interim Order was issued.
Romesh de Silva had submitted petitioner who is the Secretary to Defence and Urban Development Authority had directed the Board of Sri Lanka Land Reclamation Corporation after having sought the approval of the Board to pay and Rs 10 million was paid to commence the work for the construction of the Late D.A. Rajapakse foundation where all the expenses would be reimbursed by various sources and he alleged this fact is suppressed.
Senior Deputy Solicitor General Viraj Dayaratne had maintained the Interim Order was obtained ex parte.
He said the petitioner in his petition did not ask the Court to prevent him from being arrested and remanded but quash the ASPs certificate submitted to the Magistrate preventing the FCID from acting on it under the Public Property Act. So it is not the issue of fundamental Rights violation and if so it should be referred to the Supreme Court.
He had also said the police recorded the first information on complaint and submitted the report to the competent court, the Magistrate as well as the Attorney General for instruction so Attorney General has not violated any law and there is no suppression of facts. There is no violation of law, he said.
He had said there is not only the Petitioner but six others are also there. He argued the Court of Appeal has no jurisdiction to hear
The Court on November 29 last year, initially issued the Interim Order till December 6 observing that that it was a commercial transaction and there was no element of the offence of dishonesty under Penal Code and that the said B Report is ex facie (evidently,.on the face of it) wrong.
The petitioner stated that the D.A.Rajapaksa Foundation, a statutory body, entered into a contract with the Sri Lanka Land Reclamation Board for the construction of a monument at Madamulana Weeraketiya. He also has stated that there was no written contract.
Petitioner Gotabaya Rajapaksha in his application cited IGP Pujith Jayasundara, CID Director Shani Abeysekera, Financial Crimes Investigation Division DIG Ravi Waidyalankara, ASP Kamal Paliskara and the Attorney General as Respondents.
Romesh de Silva PC with Ali Sabri PC and Sugath Caldera and Ruwantha Cooray instructed by Sanath Wijewardane appeared for the Petitioner. Senior Deputy Solicitor General Viraj Dayaratne with Deputy Solicitors General Thisith Mudalige and Dilan Ratnayake and Senior State Counsel Nirmalan Wigneswaran appeared for the Respondents and the Attorney General.

Duminda Attygalle, a proud old boy and former rugby captain of Royal College Colombo, is another candidate contesting for the Colombo Municipal Council from the Cinnamon Gardens Ward under the UNP ticket. Currently pursuing his Masters in Business Administration at the British School of Commerce in Colombo affiliated to Anglia Ruskins University, England, Attygalle believes that young and educated candidates should take to politics. In a candid interview with the Daily Mirror, Attygalle shared his plans for Colombo. 
Following are excerpts of the interview Attygalle did with the Daily Mirror.
I think the cream of politicians are in the UNP; people whom you can work with for the future. It has the most knowledgeable and intelligent people. The majority always tries to do something good
	From my small days I have been interested in how development is done. But I have heard that things arent done properly and politicians blame each other. So I wanted to be a part of this situation
	Im working with Rosy Senanayake who has plans to digitize the whole system and make Colombo a smart city. That is a good process to reduce corruption and make things more transparent
Q How do you feel about contesting in an election for the first time
Its very exciting and I learn new things everyday. 
Q Why did you want to enter politics
From my small days I have been interested in how development is done. But I have heard that things arent done properly and politicians blame each other. So I wanted to be a part of this situation and see what actually happens. 
Q Any particular reason as to why you want to contest from the UNP ticket
I think the cream of politicians are in the UNP; people whom you can work with for the future. It has the most knowledgeable and intelligent people. The majority always tries to do something good. Therefore it is a good place to work from. 
Q What are the main issues you have identified in Colombo
When I did my door-to-door campaigns we were doing a survey where we got all the people involved. From that survey we found out that garbage collection should receive topmost priority. The biggest problem they face is that garbage was supposed to be collected in three streams. So if waste food is to be collected on Friday the CMC people come for that on Monday. This becomes a huge issue to the entire neighbourhood when food rots and develops a stench. Therefore this process has to be monitored and they should actually collect it on the correct day. Some residents were saying that they collect in three streams, but when they come they ask to put everything together. There has to be proper supervisors to make sure its done methodically. On the other hand the garbage in small lanes never gets collected. So we need to put in a little bit of effort to put things right. There is also a problem with dengue. So we need to ensure that fumigation is done and all mosquito breeding sites destroyed. 
Q One issue about Colombo today is the slums, commonly known as wathu. During the city beautification projects they will be excavated and the residents will be relocated elsewhere. How do you see this problem, considering the fact that they are an essential component in a city landscape
They should be a part of the city, but I hope they are compensated in the event that they are moved out to a better location. I have been going to Tharawatta and those people are happy to leave provided they are given what they deserve. I believe that when they are relocated it should be done in such a way that they dont have a need to return to their old place. If they do it properly there wont be a problem. When I went to these places sanitation, infrastructure and other services needed more attention. Its not fair and safe for people to live like that. They should be given better standards to live. 
Q How challenging is the new electoral system
The electoral system is good because there was no representation for places like Cinnamon Gardens during the preferential vote system. So the people and residents were neglected. But this system will ensure that there is someone responsible to see that these things are provided. If there was a person responsible to look after people in these wathu for example, they wouldnt be facing so many challenges like what they are going through today. People dont have to waste so much money in running around an entire district as well. I think it will promote less corruption. 
Q As a young candidate, what plans do you have for the youth in the city
Im working with Rosy Senanayake who has plans to digitize the whole system and make Colombo a smart city. That is a good process to reduce corruption and make things more transparent. So I want the youth to be involved in politics. Educated youth should be involved in politics to ensure that policies are accurately implemented. My plan is to gather youth to be a part of this process, so that they could be encouraged to be involved in active politics, in order to make a change. People think that politicians are rogues and I want to change that mindset. Therefore without criticizing politicians, more educated people should be involved in the political system. 
Q How confident are you that you will win
Cinnamon Gardens has anyway been a UNP Ward from the beginning. Im happy to be in this ward. Im pretty confident that I will be elected because people want young and educated people to take the lead.

On Tintin and the intricacies of translation
	
Id like to get back to Tuesdays article, and to what that former Rector of S. Thomas College, at an official function, said: That the death of the Sinhala language can be traced to the difference in quality between the television serials our children watched and what they watch today. He was thinking of foreign dubbed series, since he referred to Pissu Poosa and Dosthara Honda Hitha. Aptly put, since translations tend to open you up to creative ways of conveying foreign experiences to local audiences, and if those creative ways are exhausted, if our knowledge of our maw basa sizzles, there can be no hope for the mother tongue. An anecdote will probably help here.
Ask any ordinary teenager from my generation as to what dubbed series they watched and in five or six cases out of 10 they will say, Pissu Poosa! Part of the reason for this is that Pissu Poosa is still being telecast on local television (Rupavahini), just like that other lovable series which my generation grew through, Dosthara Hondahitha. Closer to our time, I think well probably also quote Koombichchi (who can forget the title song, set to the tune of Clarence Wijewardenas Kurulu Gamey), Naana Katha Malliya (Ang Pang Man in South Korea), and for good measure, Inguru Pan Malliya. All of them, incidentally, were relatively low cost, lacking proper copyrights, if they had copyrights in the first place, and targeted a generation which preferred stories about inanimate and unfeeling objects and creatures that were brought to life by our actors. But then there were other series, other titles, and other names.
Two years ago on Facebook, I came across a poll that ranked the best dubbed cartoon series from the last 20 years, in the form of a video. There were the usual suspects, many of them overseen by Titus Thotawatte (like Ha Ha Hari Hawa and Walas Mama, the latter of which was created by the same person who gave us Woody Woodpecker, Walter Lantz). One title was missing, though, which I waited impatiently for given that it had, more than the other series, taught me the value of emotional authenticity when it came to dubbing a foreign television series. Well, TV Show Number Two, Dosthara Honda Hitha, came and went. I waited for TV Show Number One.
I sighed. With relief. It was as I had expected. Tintin. Yes, Tintin.
Long before I took to Enid Blyton and Richmal Crompton and long, long before I caught up with Harry Potter and Hogwarts and Voldemort, I started reading Herge and Tintin. This was, I feel, a direct consequence of reading our history as comics and newspaper columns, particularly in the Funday Times, which continues its series on our kings and queens and people to date. I grew to love these comics because they had speech bubbles which conveyed what the characters were thinking even if the other characters didnt hear them. But long before I even read Tintin, I watched him.
A challenge
The Adventures of Tintin, made in the early 1990s, was a co-production between France and Canada and was telecast on HBO. It was a moderate success, but it caught on with audiences in Asia, so with time it was gradually dubbed into other languages: Persian, Japanese, Hindi, even Vietnamese. Sri Lanka had a sizeable audience that had grown up on the character. It made sense, as it still does, to bring him here. When he did come here, the Rupavahini dubbing unit was no longer flanked by Thotawatte. It was being handed over to another, as formidable person: Athula Ransirilal, who would later give us Koombichchi. But there was a problem, one which those who had overseen Dosthara Honda Hitha and Pissu Poosa hadnt really encountered. The Adventures of Tintin was technically superior to anything we had dubbed in the eighties. For it to be popular, two things had to be perfect: the cast and the dubbing.
Id like to think that Rupavahini tackled both these issues well because to this day, and I am speaking frankly here, I can remember the dubbed Tintin more than the original Tintin. But then, my memories of Herge were in the first place predicated on this series. Not the books. At one level that can be quite blasphemous (after all Herge had passed away by the time of the HBO series, and his most memorable character was supposed to linger with us through his books), but at another it isnt, since this meant that those in charge of dubbing at Rupavahini had succeeded in disseminating his lovable protagonist, the most loved fictional journalist to be ever conceived, among local audiences. Not surprisingly, then, the show won with both cast and translation.
First, the cast. By default, Tintin needed to be voiced by an actor who could convey youth and courage, and Sangeeth Kalubowila, who has since conceived a career of his own as an announcer and a journalist, met this requirement by his ability to articulate both navet and resolve. As much as Kalubowila helped, however, the show would have been nothing were it not for the supporting voice players. Who can look at Captain Haddock, for instance, and not think of Parakrama Perera Who can look at Bianca Castafiore, particularly in my favourite Tintin adventure, The Castafiore Emerald (which never goes beyond Marlinspike Hall), and not think of the late Mercy Edirisinghe What of the Thom(p)son twins and Gemunu Wijesuriya, and what of half a dozen supporting characters and Wijeratne Warakagoda (whose name, perhaps because of seniority, was always at the top of the opening credits)
Unforgettable villains
It wasnt merely the cast, though. It was also the language, to be specific the translation. This was important, particularly for me, because Tintins world operated on unforgettable villains who needed catchy phrases which could help me remember them even though I wasnt watching the series. Haddocks two memorable oaths (being Tintin-philes, you ought to know what they are) had been dubbed excellently in my mother tongue, but more than them, it was the conversations and dialogues which kept up my interest. To a considerable extent, that helped make the Rupavahini version superior to the English original: by spicing up those conversations.
There are so many examples I can quote here. For the time being, Ill pick on two.
The first. Flight 714. The scene Rastapopulous, the villain, leaves Tintin and his friends inside a volcano (after inadvertently activating it with a detonator). Tintin escapes with the rest, but in an unlikely way: a UFO (the story was written at a time when the West was haunted by the counterculture and the American fascination with aliens had spilt over to Europe). The UFO comes across Rastapopulous and his troupe, on a small boat aimlessly wandering along the sea, and awakens them. Rastopopulous looks up, asks the others as to what it is, and gets a reply from Alan.
UFos
The HBO version has Alan say, Looks like a UFO. To which Rastapopulous replies, I dont care what it is, shoot it! Or something like that, I cant really remember. The Rupavahini version, on the other hand, has Alan say, <U+0DB6><U+0DDC><U+0DC3><U+0DCA> <U+0D92><U+0D9A> <U+0DB4><U+0DD2><U+0DBA><U+0DCF><U+0DB6><U+0DD2><U+0DB1> <U+0DB4><U+0DD3><U+0DBB><U+0DD2><U+0DC3><U+0DBA><U+0D9A><U+0DCA> <U+0DC0><U+0D9C><U+0DDA>. Rastapopulouss reply <U+0DB8><U+0DA7> <U+0DB4><U+0DD2><U+0DBA><U+0DCF><U+0DB6><U+0DD2><U+0DB1> <U+0D9A><U+0DDD><U+0DB4><U+0DCA><U+0DB4><U+0DBA><U+0DAD><U+0DCA> <U+0D91><U+0D9A><U+0DBA><U+0DD2> <U+0DB8><U+0DD2><U+0DB1><U+0DD2><U+0DC4><U+0DDD>, <U+0DC0><U+0DD9><U+0DA9><U+0DD2> <U+0DAD><U+0DD2><U+0DBA><U+0DB4><U+0DBD><U+0DCA><U+0DBD><U+0DCF>! Neater, because of the wordplay involved (theres no real word for UFO, only the literal translation of flying saucer) which the original in English couldnt make use of. Yes, this had to be the most memorable dialogue in the story.
The second. The Calculus Affair. The scene Tintin and Haddock are on their way to the train station to meet Professor Calculus, whom theyve just missed at his hotel by minutes. Two Bordurian agents, hell bent on killing our heroes and kidnapping the Professor, delay them by tripping the Captain (by the entrance to the hotel), who seethes when one of the two remarks that he is as blind as a wombat. The argument is terse, but nothing stands out. Until you get to the dubbed version: <U+0D87><U+0DC3><U+0DCA> <U+0DB1><U+0DDC><U+0DB4><U+0DD9><U+0DB1><U+0DD9><U+0DB1> <U+0DBB><U+0DD0><U+0DC0><U+0DD4><U+0DBD><U+0DCF>! the agent snaps at him, to which we get the reply, <U+0D8B><U+0DB9> <U+0DBB><U+0DD1><U+0DA7><U+0DAD><U+0DCA> <U+0D87><U+0DC3><U+0DCA> <U+0DB4><U+0DDA><U+0DB1><U+0DCA><U+0DB1><U+0DD9> <U+0DB1><U+0DD0><U+0DAD><U+0DD2> <U+0DC0><U+0DC0><U+0DD4><U+0DBD><U+0DCF>! Again you sense the superiority of the dubbing: the wordplay between ravula and wawula, which in English doesnt have the same sting, the same power.
Its no surprise, to me at least, that after more than 10 years I remember they dubbed more than the English version and this despite the fact that I still watch the latter on and off. And Im not the only one; ask anyone who was fortunate enough to watch Rupavahini back then and Im sure youll come across others who say they prefer that to the original. I could write more on this, but words are not enough.
Tintin was frequently telecast by Rupavahini. Sadly, however, not for the last 10 or 15 years. For reasons of copyright, I suppose (both Dosthara Honda Hitha and Pissu Poosa, while popular here, were relatively nondescript in their countries), although thats not a good enough excuse. Yes, audiences are different now, but children (thankfully) are still alert to nuance and subtlety. I am sure theyd still love it.
I watched Tintin before I read him. I watched him as he fought Rastapopulous, Mller, and Msstler with his friends. I caught on what they did. In the end (I like to believe) they shaped me, as they shaped every other kid. Rupavahini helped, of this Im certain. And one of these days, Id like to watch him again. In Sinhala.

President cant punish rouges due to affiliation with UNP- JO
	
President Maithripala Sirisena will not be able to punish culprits of the bond scam and other alleged individuals as far as he is affiliated with the United National Party (UNP), MP Piyal Nishantha said today.
Addressing a news briefing, he said President Sirisena had been unable to take some serious actions against the culprits of the bond scam because of the pressure from UNP members.
Although he flattered that he would take stern action against the convicts of bond scam and other alleged individuals, he has not been able to put his words into action. He should have the guts to take action independently. However, President Sirisena still has the time to leave the UNP and take independent steps, MP Nishantha said.
Meanwhile, MP Gamini Lokuge said that the government was making use of the bond issue to cover up other burning issues like fertilizer issue, SAITM issue, railway divers strike, and issues in the Electricity Board etc.
The bond scam is not the only issue that needs to be addressed. As I said, there are more important issues that require pertinent solutions. Thus, we insist the government to look into those matters also with immediate effect, MP Lokuge said. (Sheain Fernandopulle)

Rajiv Gandhi assassination: CBI says "no help from Sri Lanka"
	
A convict who has spent 26 years in jail for the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi has requested the Supreme Court to reopen the case and cancel his conviction.
This, after the CBI said in court today that it got "no help from Sri Lanka" in investigating the origin of the bomb plan.
AG Perarivalan was convicted of supplying two nine-volt batteries for the belt-bomb that killed the former prime minister in 1991, and sentenced to life in jail. Last year, he had asked for pardon, saying that the CBI dropped the part in his confession where he had said he had "absolutely no idea" what the batteries were for.
The CBI told the court that the conspiracy behind the bomb that killed Rajiv Gandhi could not be investigated as the "Sri Lankan authorities were not cooperating".
Perarivalan's appeal for a court review of his sentence quotes V Thiagarajan - a senior CBI officer at the time - who had said that he hadn't questioned him properly. The former officer had reportedly also said Perarivalan didn't know the purpose of the batteries he bought.
Perarivalan had also told the Supreme Court that the person who made the bomb is in Sri Lanka and hadn't been questioned yet by investigators.
Perarivalan was 19 when he was arrested weeks after the assassination. He spent 14 years in solitary confinement after being sentenced to hang. His death sentence was changed to life term by the Supreme Court in 2014.
A multi-agency probe was set up in 1998 on the recommendation of the Jain Commission which investigated the Rajiv Gandhi assassination conspiracy.
Rajiv Gandhi was killed by a woman operative of the separatist Lankan Tamil outfit LTTE, who greeted him at a rally in Sriperumbudur town with a bomb strapped to her chest. (NDTV)

Self-taught Ayurveda doctor serves in silence
	
Ayurvedic physician Chitra Wickramarachchi says that untreated phlegm can develop to a cancer
Hailing from the Nawagamu Weda generation, ayurvedic doctor Chitra Wickramarachchi cures complicated diseases. She started memorizing the ancient medicinal inscriptions given to her by her grandmother every morning when she was 7 years old. She successfully completed her studies and was employed before getting married. Soon after her marriage, her husband encouraged her to continue with the Wedakama (Treating of patients) which is known as Ayurveda (alternative medicine). 
Dr. Wickramarachchi had treated patients without possessing a certificate from the Ayurvedic Council for 15 years. However she finally received her certificate to officially practice Ayurveda from the Navinna Ayurveda Council. She had cured more than 40,000 patients even before she received her Ayurvedic certificate. 
She is the mother of three daughters. One of them Piyumi Wickramarachchi has already started her studies in Ayurvedic medicine and helps her mother when the latter treats patients. 
(More information about this method of alternative medicine can be obtained by visiting Ayurvedic Dr. Chitra Chandani Wickramarachchi at 345, Siddhadi Weda Medura, Nagara Seema Mawatha, Athurugiriya Road, Homagama or by calling 0713464276 0759061771. She can be reached via electronic mail on siddhadiwedamedura@gmail.com)
Dr. Wickramarachchi has a trained staff engaged in preparing medications; including dry balls, concoctions, medicinal oils and all types of medicine thats prescribed for patients. She has a vast supply of raw herbs that are stored in large barrels for future use. Even if many Ayurvedic and traditional indigenous doctors view the process of finding herbs and medicines arduous, she affirms that it easy to collect genuine medicine through familiar suppliers. 
Produces her own oils and powders 
Medicine making, packaging and storing takes place from morning till night under the strict supervision of Dr. Wickramarachchi, at her residence. They have user-friendly concoctions that are already made and stored in glass bottles which are later refrigerated. Dr. Wickramarachchi has her own oil productions and powders that are used to treat arthritis, cholesterol, lack of hair growth and numerous other ailments and for general well-being. 
Diabetes and bypass patients can be treated within six months, but arthritis is one of most difficult to cure diseases with Rheumatoid Arthritis being the hardest to treat. Cancer is also curable. Fatty liver is cured within a month, she said.
According to her, gastritis has become the most common disease. Most of her patients suffer from this ailment. 
Dr. Wickramarachchi takes the full use of western medicinal practices such as blood tests, scans, and other numerous tests. The doctor states that she does this for the benefit of patients because it helps her to recognize and analyze diseases before starting treatment. She said that she uses such practices to make Ayurvedic treatment more efficient. 
Emphasizing on the importance of the timely treatment of phlegm, Dr. Wickramarachchi said that phlegm is the leading cause that invites a number of diseases to the body.  Untreated phlegm accumulates in the human body and grows to be a giant calcified component which eventually develops cancer. Therefore, cancer patients should never have leafy greens like Kathuru murunga and Wel penela which are high in calcium, she noted. 
She treats patients between 9. 00 am and 6.00 pm, except on Fridays and full moon poya days. 

Dr. Wickramarachchi strictly advised Arthritic patients to consume only warm water when washing themselves or taking a shower. She also advised these patients to avoid food that is considered to arouse Waatha in the body. She also instructed cancer patients to avoid oils and using coconut milk in their cooking. Gastritis patients are advised to keep their tummy fires under control and warned to avoid highly acidic food. 
Dr. Wickramarachchi is skilled in Rasa Wedakama, a system of treatment which incorporates mixing ashes of gold, silver, and mercury. She treats patients between 9. 00 am and 6.00 pm, except on Fridays and full moon poya days.

Speaker not informed of unity govt. extension
	
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said yesterday he had not received a letter extending the agreement of the national government.
The Speaker said this when JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake asked him whether the agreement to form the national government has been renewed and if so whether he received the renewal agreement.
JO MP Dinesh Gunawardane said the government had violated the Constitution by appointing a Cabinet, State and deputy ministers exceeding the amount stipulated in the Constitution as the period of the national government had expired.
"The agreement of the national government between the UNP and the SLFP expired on December 31. Accordingly, Cabinet ministers should be limited to 30," he said.
He asked the Prime Minister if he admitted to the fact that the government had violated the Constitution by appointing Cabinet, State and Deputy ministers exceeding the amount stipulated in the constitution and the fact that agreement of the national government had expired.
MP Gunawardane also asked whether the appointment of Sriyani Wijewickrama and Piyasena Gamage as State ministers had been approved by the President and the Prime Minister as required by the Constitution. He said appointment of ministers should be approved by the President and the Prime Minister according to the Constitution. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)

VIP robbers delayed Parliament debate: President
	
While claiming that a coalition of VIP 'robbers' both in the government and the opposition had managed to delay the debate on the bond commission report and the PRECIFAC report, President Maithripala Sirisena today challenged them to hold the debate on the bond commission and PRECIFAC report before February 10, prior to the Local Government elections.
Addressing an election propaganda rally in Panadura, President Sirisena said a coalition of VIP 'robbers' involved in the bond scam attached to the government and the opposition had gathered at a house in Borella and decided to delay the debate on both reports.
President Sirisena said they had met the day before when Parliament decided to hold the debate after the election.
President Sirisena said after receiving the bond commission report by him, the opposition had continuously urged to hold a debate on it and to make it a public document immediately.
By then I had not read the full report. Within three days time, I went through it and made a statement with regard to it. Then, the bond commission and PRECIFAC reports were presented in Parliament,
He said however, surprisingly these parties were silent after presenting these two reports to the Parliament and they had decided to hold the debate after the Local Government election.
Both these parties have decided to hold the debate on both reports after the election since it would expose the nakedness of both these parties. Therefore I challenge all these heroes to hold this debate at least for one day before February 10, he said. (Muditha Dayananda)
