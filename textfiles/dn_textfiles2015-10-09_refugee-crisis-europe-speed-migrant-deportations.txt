Refugee crisis: Europe to speed up migrant deportations

Luxembourg: The union discussed creating a border force among measures to cope with hundreds of thousands of refugees from Syria's civil war. Nearly 600,000 people have flooded into Europe this year.
The policy document approved in Luxembourg called on states to ensure more of those ordered to leave actually went. Some 470,000 expulsion orders were made last year but fewer than 40 per cent of them were enforced.
Ministers declined to put figures on future deportations.
"Increased return rates should act as a deterrent to irregular migration," read the conclusions, which also included approval of detention for those who may abscond before expulsion and called for more "leverage" to be exercised on African and other poor states, including via aid budgets, to make them accept the return of citizens refused entry to Europe.
"Returns are always tough," German Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere said.
"But ... we can only offer space and support to refugees in need of protection if those who don't need protection don't come or are quickly returned." Sydney Morning Herald
