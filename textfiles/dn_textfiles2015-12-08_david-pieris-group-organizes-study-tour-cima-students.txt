David Pieris Group organizes study tour for CIMA students

CIMA Sri Lanka and David Pieris Group hosted a group of 24 CIMA students from Jaffna on a three-day extensive study tour.
The participants were given in-depth exposure to the corporate sector and practical application of their learning. This study tour aimed to assist them in realizing and planning for their future career goals. For many of the youth, it was their first exposure to a large-scale corporation.
Participants attended an introductory session focusing on the different aspects of employability and employer expectations, facilitated by Harshana Dassanayake - Director and corporate trainer at DAASH Consultants and Third Wave International Pvt Ltd. Senior management also shared their personal experience and expectations from those hoping to enter the corporate sector.
The practical aspect of the tour saw the students visiting the company's two-wheeler and three-wheeler assembly plants. Business models and operations were explained to the participants, in addition to giving them a first-hand view of the technology in these facilities. As one participant aptly stated, "I have learned a lot and it has changed my attitude towards the future." Speaking regarding this initiative, Radley Stephen (Country Head Sri Lanka, CIMA) elaborated, "We are pleased to know that David Pieris Motor Company Limited has understood the long-term sustainable needs of the country and are delighted with their initiative to support students, especially those from the North, by providing them with the much needed corporate exposure."
