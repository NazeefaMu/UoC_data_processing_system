President Maithripala Sirisena has said he did not wish to use the Presidential super luxury abode built by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa in Kankesanthurai (KKS) at a cost of Rs. 3.5 billion and as such it could be used by Ministers, public officials and tourists at a cost, a Spokesman of the Presidential Secretariat said.

The spokesman said the super luxury Presidential Palace built by the Sri Lanka Army in 2012 with five-star accommodation and facilities on a 100-acre land could be used as a high-end tourist attraction as Jaffna did not have a five-star hotel right now.

“Arrangements will be made shortly for the reservation at the facility through the Presidential Secretariat and any individual or a group is free to do so when it is opened for reservations.” He added.

Meanwhile, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said he had instructed Ministry officials not to go ahead with the proposed construction of a Circuit Bungalow near the Pesalai Jetty for the use of visiting Ministers and officials after President Sirisena decided to open the KKS Presidential Palace for the public.

“I believe President Sirisena has given an opportunity to the public, tourists and public officials to use a super luxury facility for an affordable price as I think this will not be as costly as a five-star hotel facility in Colombo,” Minister Amaraweera said. (Sandun A Jayasekera)
