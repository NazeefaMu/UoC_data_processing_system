Police Spokesman SSP Priyantha Jayakody said seven suspects including four civilians and three police officers attached to the said DIG’s office have already been arrested following investigations and added the DIG was transferred to the Eastern Province in order to maintain the credibility of investigations.
He said the Special Investigation Unit (SIU) had sought assistance of the Attorney General in this regard and the AG had instructed the police yesterday, to arrest the DIG in question.
“We have launched a probe to arrest the DIG who has absconded,” the SSP said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
