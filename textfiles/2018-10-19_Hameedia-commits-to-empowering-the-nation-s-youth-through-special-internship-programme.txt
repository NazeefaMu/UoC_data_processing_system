This program is especially designed for students, school-leavers and undergraduates aged between 18 and 23 years, the six-month internship programme will initially enroll 25 interns, who will receive valuable experience and exposure in the field of Marketing, Sales and Retail. Selling is vital for any profession, so by enrolling to this internship program you will be able to get the exposure and experience to sell. This program will continue throughout the year and providing opportunity for all the youths across the country. 

While the core focus of the internship programme will be on Sales and Retail, interns will also be exposed to interesting new skills and concepts such as designing shirts, eating healthy and engaging in community initiatives. In addition to the rare opportunity to experience Hameedia’s dynamic working environment, the exclusive programme will also give interns the chance to custom-design a shirt and present it as a gift during the Christmas season. During the training period, interns will learn to embrace a more holistic approach to dressing and living well, and will be trained on how to prepare an array of wholesome and healthy meals, which they can recreate at home for their families. The participants would be able to engage in Outward bound training so that the participants will be physically fit as well.
