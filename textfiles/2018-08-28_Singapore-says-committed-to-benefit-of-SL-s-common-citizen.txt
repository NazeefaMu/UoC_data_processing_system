Singapore was committed to the benefit of the common citizen though some forces make misleading statements, Singaporean Foreign Affairs Minister Vivian Balakrishnan had informed Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, sources close to Prime Minister told journalists on Monday.

The Singaporean Minister has expressed this sentiment during the one-to-one meeting he held with Sri Lankan Prime Minister on the sidelines of ongoing third edition of Indian Ocean Conference in Hanoi.

Mr.Wickremesinghe had told the Singaporean Minister that the objective of the Yahapalana Government is to turn the country around from the political and economic set back it had suffered as a result of petty politics by some and their personal agendas.

Both leaders have focused on geopolitics during the discussion. (Yohan Perera in Vietnam)
