Reconciliation, to a larger extent should be a national task – German FM

Reconciliation, to a larger extent should be a national task. There will have to be international assistance, but to what extent, remains to be seen during deliberation at the United Nations Human Rights Council, visiting German Federal Foreign Affairs Minister Dr Frank-Walter Steinmeier yesterday said, responding to a question posed by a journalist with regard to Germany’s position on the actions to be taken by the government of Sri Lanka in view of the UNHRC report on alleged war crimes in Sri Lanka.
He said, Germany has a chair at the UN Human Rights Council right now and that is why they exchanged its views about it with Sri Lanka at the present meetings. “We understand that this is a very sensitive issue,” he said and added, “ Germany will provide its assistance to Sri Lanka.” .
German Federal Foreign Affairs Minister Dr Steinmeier was addressing a joint press briefing with Foreign Affairs Minister Mangala Samaraweera at the Foreign Affairs Ministry in Colombo.
Samaraweera said on being asked the question, we have already given our ideas on how this problem of accountability and justice would be resolved in the country. “The government of President Maithripala Sirisena came to power in January with a mandate given to him by the people, which included the setting up of a domestic credible mechanism with international technical assistance,” he pointed out.
“Based on that mandate, the Sri Lankan government started working out the contours of of such a mechanism in the past few months, and we did come up with a non paper on how this mechanism should operate, which I briefly outlined when I made my remarks in Geneva on Monday,” he said.
“Of course, the UN Human Rights High Commissioner too set out their ideas. We feel that there are are no major differences except one or two areas where we have to find the point of convergence in the type of judicial mechanism we envisaged,” he stated.
“We discussed with the ministers about our stand. We have told the UN and other international partners that we always welcome international assistance. The form and shape of such assistance is what needs to be finalized and this should be done after consultations which we hope to commence in mid October,” the minister said.
