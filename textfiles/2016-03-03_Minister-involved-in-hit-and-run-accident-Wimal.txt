Opposition MP Wimal Weerawansa yesterday criticised the Government for not taking any action against a Minister, who was involved in a road accident, where two youths had been injured at Rajagiriya last Monday.

He questioned as to why the Government was not taking action, when the CCTV footages, had clearly showed the way the accident happened and the Minister had driven, his vehicle without any security officer.

He claimed that one of the two injured youths was in critical condition.

“All the family members of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and his acquaintances are being arrested over various reasons and some of the charges and laws have never been heard of,” he said.

“The Independent Police Commission seems to be non-functioning for the cases where Ministers of the current Government are involved in,” he said.

He said that double standards of law were being implemented for those who were in the Government and the Joint Opposition.

Speaking on the investigations into the murder of former Havelock's Sports Club Captain Wasim Thajudeen, MP Weerawansa alleged that the Government was changing its narrative on the Rugby player’s death.

He said that the Government first claimed Yoshitha Rajapaksa was involved due to a dispute over Yoshitha’s alleged girlfriend, appeared to be failed, after it was found that Yoshitha Rajapaksa was abroad at that time.

Mr. Weerawansa said that the Government was now going after MP Namal Rajapaksa.

“Now, the Government is claiming that Namal Rajapaksa committed this crime to take over a Sport Club,” he said. (Piyumi Fonseka)
