The National Lotteries Board and the Development Lotteries Board decided yesterday to suspend their agreements with the agents who were involved in a protest.

“According to the agreement, we have the power to suspend the people who protested if they do not sell lottery tickets for a period of one month. We have identified the people who were behind the protest, and we will take legal action against the ones who damaged the property of the DLB,” said DLB chairman/CEO Mr. Romesh Jayawardhana.

The chairpersons of the two lotteries boards said they had appointed some new agents and would appoint some more within this month.

Expressing her views, Ms. Shyamila Perera, chairperson of NLB said that lottery prices would remain unchanged and they would not bow down to the agents’ unreasonable demands. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
