Saint Paul’s Church in Kandy stood the changing times for one hundred and seventy-five years, dedicated to Saint Paul, who was born as Saul.


Paul the Apostle, commonly known as Saint Paul and also known by his Jewish name Saul of Tarsus, was an apostle who taught the gospel of the Christ to the first century world. He was born to Jewish parents in a tribe living in the town of Tarsus. 


Later Saint Paul was arrested by Nero, the ruler of Rome. Paul was executed as a lesson to the people, who resisted Roman Empire.


The Church in Kandy was named after St. Paul, the Apostle.


After the British annexed the Kandyan Kingdom, the historic Audience Hall was used for Sunday Service.

 


But, the Church continued to serve its parishioners and lived in the midst of a religious atmosphere. It still continues its Sunday Services and other ceremonies


 


Bishop- the second Lord Bishop of Calcutta whose diocese extended to Ceylon. On August 15, 1825, he visited Sri Lanka via the port of Galle.


With Governor Edward Barnes, Bishop Herber visited Kandy on September 14, 1825 - ten years after the British conquered the country.


On September 18, 1825, he held a Confirmation Service at the 
Audience Hall.


Bishop Reginald Heber was not satisfied with the use of the Audience Hall as a Church and he informed the Governor that this was out of taste. On the other hand, the Buddhist clergy and the Trustees of the Devales also did not agree with this arrangement.


Taking this opportunity the Legislative Council brought out “The Church Ordinance” and allowed one thousand five hundred Sterling Pounds for the building of a Church in Kandy. This is the beginning of the St. Paul’s Church Kandy. The Church stands in the form of a cross inside of which has no pillars. It is built on Herring Bone architecture with all Satinwood.


The land according to the former Diyawadana Nilame, Neranjan Wijeyaratne, was once a part of the Wel Bodhiya, which is currently the property of Asgiri Mahanayake.




This land was acquired by the Government and it issued a public notice of any objections. The objections were to be personally brought before the Government Agent. No Buddhist monks would make his way at that time and since the time had lapsed, the land was handed over to St. Paul’s Church. Under a Sacred Area concept St. Paul’s school was removed and twenty acres of land was allocated to the Trustees of St. Paul’s Church to re-build a Church at Tennakumbura.


But, over the years it did not materialise. Instead, a Vocational Training Institute was established. The Government of the day did not pursue it further and there stands St. Paul’s Church.


“The St.Paul’s College was demolished and in its place Sumangala College was established with all the students from St. Paul’s College taken into the new school,” the former Diyawadana Nilame said.
But, the Church continued to serve its parishioners and lived in the midst of a religious atmosphere. It still continues its Sunday Services and other ceremonies.


The exact date of Church building is obscure. The consecration of the present Church building was by Bishop of Colombo Rev. James Chapman on January 25, 1853.

 



 


In a note, he says that the Church is 120 feet long and 80 feet wide.


The original building would have been constructed on the lines of English Churches.


Some records indicate the date thirty years before. There are no proper records, except the visit of the Bishop of Calcutta in 1825, Rev. Reginald Heber and his arrival in Kandy with Governor Barnes.


The main Church building, however, had been altered in 1878, 1928 and 1953. It has stood the test of time and also moved with the changing times.


But what the Church lost was the original stained Glass window installed by the widow of a coffee planter Laurence St. George Carey of De Vallon Estate, Pussellawa in 1874.


Sadly the stained glass window was shattered in the 1998 LTTE bomb attack on the Sri Dalada Maligawa.


Yet, it was left to a Buddhist Technician, Ajith Gunasekera to put it back, piece by piece, and restore it.


Today it stands with a few pieces missing with all its glory.


St. Paul’s Church is a landmark in the historic town and blends with the heritage aspect giving any visitor the magnanimity of Buddhist principles and the teachings of Buddha.
