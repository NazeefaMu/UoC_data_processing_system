Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara yesterday asked journalists not to treat seriously the remarks made by Tourism Promotion and Christian Religeous Affairs Minister John Amaratunga.

Journalists questioned the rationale of threatening remarks allegedly made by Minister Amaratunga targeting political opponents of the UNP saying that ‘the government is ours and the police therefore also ours’.

Minister Jayasekara: Don’t take much notice of these remarks. This is not the policy of the Yahapalana government. We are committed to uphold the concept of good governance, free and fair elections and the rule of law.

Journalist: But these remarks are an indication of what political opponents of the UNP could expect during this election time.

Minister Jayasekara. No no, please don’t make judgements on these flimsy utterances. Besides, Minister Amaratunga is a person with a big frame. He may have said those things without much thinking of the repercussions.

Journalist: A number of DIGs have complained to the Police Commission against the IGP. What is going on in the Police Department.

Minister Jayasekara: I am not aware. However, if such complaints have been made, the Police Commission will investigate it for sure.

Minister Rajitha Senaratne: Anyway, it is true that if you have the power, you have the Police force under you also.

Journalist: Do you think it is proper for Minister Amaratunga to say this?.

Minister Senaratne: We don’t do all what we say all the time.

Journalist: The US government has accepted Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and the US embassy will be moved to Jerusalem from Tel-Aviv accordingly.

Minister Senaratne: No. Sri Lanka will not accept it and Sri Lanka’s embassy in Israel will not be moved to Jerusalem.

Journalist: Do Sri Lanka accept Jerusalem as the capital of Israel?

Minister Senaratne: Not at all. The entire Muslim world, EU, Russia, China and many other countries have already condemned this decision by the US. The Palestine Solidarity Movement of Sri Lanka has organized a rally in support of the Palestine on next Friday in Colombo. (Sandun A Jayasekera)
