The right quality of rice

The price of rice is escalating daily making the consumers pay more for their staple diet. Meanwhile, the authorities have failed to take meaningful steps to solve some of the problems related to rice production. The winding up of the Paddy Marketing Board (PMB) would give the private sector a free hand to handle this vital sector in our country.
There are many problems when dealing with paddy cultivation and rice production. One is to provide good quality rice and it is strange that this situation continues despite laws such as those on consumer protection.
Before 1977 rice milling was the sole monopoly of the government. The government made use of the private rice millers to process the paddy brought under the guaranteed price scheme. The rice thus processed was distributed by the Food Department.
The system of government control was introduced to regulate the price of rice and to give farmers a better floor price. The setting up of the PMB was to purchase paddy from the farmers and sell rice to the consumers at a reasonable price. Therefore, it became the sole responsibility of the PMB to handle the food supply in the country.
The Food Department
With the change of government in 1977, it was decided to do away with the existing system. Thus the milling and marketing of rice was passed on to the private sector. The PMB functioned as a standby to handle milling and selling rice and it also kept buffer stocks to keep the price of rice stable.
The Food Department handled the imported rice and the PMB was in charge of handling local rice. Along with these changes small time rice millers came into the scene.
After liberalization, millers have become the middlemen who buy paddy, mill it and sell it to consumers. They also handle the distribution of paddy to the retail sellers. The consumers in turn receive their supply of rice from the wholesalers as well as retail dealers.
In the end, the millers and traders profit at the expense of the farmers and consumers. In the study of the problems dealing with rice production, one has to go into the details concerning the process of rice milling. Only then will it be possible to identify the problems.
There are two types of milling done in our country. They are raw rice milling and parboiled milling. Raw rice milling is done mainly in the south of Sri Lanka.
The advantage of milling parboiled rice is that it can be kept for a longer time than raw rice. But the raw rice is more nutritious than parboiled rice. It is also found that two thirds of our consumers eat parboiled rice.
Modern milling methods
In order to produce quality rice, the first step is to harvest the paddy at the proper time. When the grain is harvested there is 15% to 18% moisture in the grain. The process of milling par boiled rice begins by soaking the paddy in water, steaming, drying and finally hulling.
Paddy is soaked in cold water for 24 hours before it is steamed and par boiled. The water is changed at least once every twelve hours. Research has shown that the process of hot water soaking before steaming and parboiling takes less time. It also removes the offensive smell in parboiled rice.
In developed countries, modern milling methods have reduced the time required for parboiling to a few hours. This is possible by adopting the technique of soaking paddy in hot water.
In our country, the mills usually keep the paddy for 24 to 36 hours in cold water. They do not change the water to make the rice absorb more moisture and become heavier. The quality of water affects the rice adversely. The ideal form of drying is achieved through sunlight. The moisture content in rice for milling should be 13.5 - 14% which is the same as for milling raw rice.
The fact remains that the miller is not concerned in giving the consumer quality rice. He mills his rice when the moisture content is between 15 -16%. This gives added weight to the rice but its keeping time is shortened and it tends to mould in storage.
In finding solutions to overcome these problems Pathmasiri Dias of Somasiri Hullers has identified the areas where improvements should be made.
He has pointed out the stages that need the attention of the rice millers; cleaning, milling and winnowing, separating, destining, polishing and grading.
During these stages the millers should take extra care in the process of milling. When paddy is brought from the threshing floor, there are impurities picked up especially while harvesting and transporting, which has to be cleaned before milling begins.
This means the extraction of dust and other extraneous matter such as immature, unripe paddy, sand and stones. When cleaning paddy, a sheller (rubber roller) should be used. Before the rubber roller, steel cylinders were used and there was a high rate of breakage of grains.
The sheller separates the hull from the grain. In advanced rice-producing countries, rubber roller shellers are used for rice milling.
The process of hulling or shelling is designed to separate the hull from the grain. The hull must be separated from the grain through the process of winnowing.
In shelling or hulling the milling machine functions only with 85 percent efficiency. This result in 85 percent of brown rice and 15 percent un-hulled grain mixed with extraneous matter such as stones equivalent in size to the paddy grain left over.
The paddy thus hulled and winnowed comes out approximately as 85% brown rice and 15% un-hulled paddy.
The mixture of rice and un-hulled of separation where a separator is used. This machine separates the brown rice from the un-hulled paddy. The hulled brown rice is contaminated with a certain amount of stones equivalent in size to the grains.
The separated brown rice will now go through the process of de-stoning. The most efficient process of de-stoning can be done at this point because of the difference in surface structures between the grain and stones.
Developed countries
The grain still coated with bran has a smooth and even surface while the stones have a rough and uneven surface. The process of de-stoning leaves the brown rice taking away the contaminating foreign matter.
In developed countries at this stage the rice grain is polished. The best method of polishing is not to apply too much of pressure to the grain which will result in breathing and consequently cracking it. Polishing is best done in three stages.
The first stage removes 40 to 45 percent of bran by a polisher. This is called first - pass - polishing. Then the rice is tempered or allowed to cool. In the second stage called the second - pass - polishing another 30 - 35% bran is removed. The machine peeler is then used to remove the balance bran. It should be noted that is the bran. It should be noted that it is the bran that contains the nutrition. The rice thus gone through the processes of polishing and pealing contains a small amount of broken rice. Separation of the broken rice from the whole grain is the process of grading.
In our country rice millers use only a sheller and a polisher of the cylinder type. This type of polishing results in wasting the grain and in passing husk with polished grain proper milling and polishing results in 71% turnover efficiency as against 67-68% efficiency when done in the wrong way. The process of milling must be improved in matters of cleaning, par-boiling, hulling, destoning, polishing and grading.
The rice must leave the mill as quality rice with the correct moisture content and free of impurities.
The quality must be ensured and in a manner that leaves no room for the wholesaler and the retailer to tamper with it. Today, adulteration takes place either at the miller's end or at the trader's end. Therefore rice leaving the mill should be packed in 1/2 kg, 1kg, 5kg, 10kg, 50kg and 80kg packages. Each packet should carry the name and address of the miller. Only then can the miller be held responsible for the quality of the rice packets will prevent adulteration at the trader's end. Only the co-ordinated approach will improve the quality of rice that the consumers' need.
