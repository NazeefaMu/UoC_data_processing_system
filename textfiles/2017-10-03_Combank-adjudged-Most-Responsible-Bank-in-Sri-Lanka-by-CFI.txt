The Commercial Bank of Ceylon has been adjudged the ‘Most Responsible Bank’ in Sri Lanka by the London based print journal and online resource ‘Capital Finance International’ (CFI) which reports on business, economics and finance.


This significant accolade was awarded especially in recognition of Commercial Bank’s commitment to improve Green financing – such as renewable energy projects on a large scale – by exploring the Green energy potential in the country.


Furthermore, the bank’s investment interest in tourism, healthcare, and infrastructure projects in the country too played a part in winning it the ‘Most Responsible Bank – Sri Lanka’ 2017 award.


The CFI judging panel commended Commercial Bank on its robust approach to responsible banking and recognised its pioneering role in this regard. Notably, the Commercial Bank of Ceylon is an early signatory to the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC), a UN initiative to encourage businesses worldwide to adopt sustainable and socially-responsible policies.


“The Commercial Bank of Ceylon prides itself on adhering to the highest standards of corporate governance and corporate social responsibility, building on a business model that serves the interests of all stakeholders,” commented Commercial Bank Managing Director egan Durairatnam
“This award is yet another affirmation of our commitment to not just serving our customers better, but of our responsibility in conducting business in a manner that results in the betterment of the country.”
The CFI awards programme seeks out individuals and organisations that contribute significantly to the convergence of economies and add value for all stakeholders. Reporting from the frontlines of economic convergence, CFI.co underlines that best practice is to be found throughout the world and its awards programme aims to identify and reward excellence wherever it is found in the hope of inspiring others to further improve their own performances.


The publication is particularly interested in including smaller companies that contribute to global progress, but might otherwise go unnoticed on the international stage.
