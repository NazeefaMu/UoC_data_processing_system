Mother’s attire no longer an issue: Minister


	

Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said today said that as long as the mother’s attire is appropriate, she can enter into the school when dropping off or picking up her children.

He said the Ministry had already issued a circular informing Zonal Education Directors and Principals in this regard.

He said the decision was made after considering the requests received by mothers who are bringing in their children on their way to work. Most of the parents visit schools for parent-teacher meetings from their places of work, he said.

“There were reports that many mothers had to leave their children at the school gates because of their attire. Parents usually drop off their children on their way to work and most of the women no longer wear sarees to work. Parents can’t leave their children at gates. Therefore, any mother who brings in her children wearing appropriate attire can enter the school,” the minister told addressing an event held in Vijayaba National School in Mahawa.
