A story much talked about in political circles and the public domain nowadays says there is a strange purohita who provides jobs to only those recommended by two comely ladies.
So a long queue of job seekers armed with letters of recommendation from the two ladies has become almost a daily feature at the ministry premises, they say.
Meanwhile, one of these two ladies goes about in a vehicle belonging to an authority coming under the purview of the Ministry thanks to the benevolence of the purohita. By the way, she is a businessperson who was at the centre of a fiasco that created a sensation in the country during the previous regime.  
The other lady, wife of a former purohita, with two charming young daughters is a popular figure in social circles.
