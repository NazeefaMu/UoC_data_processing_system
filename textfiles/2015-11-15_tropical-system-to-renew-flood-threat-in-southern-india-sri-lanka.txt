Tropical system to renew flood threat in Sri Lanka


	


	The threat for flooding will be renewed in Sri Lanka and southern India Sunday into Wednesday, regardless of tropical development.
	On the heels of the tropical low that produced flooding in parts of southern India earlier this week, another tropical system is taking shape in the southern Bay of Bengal.
	Due to eventual interaction with both Sri Lanka and India, development into a named tropical system will be hindered though it remains a possibility that a weak tropical cyclone forms before the system tracks into India early next week.
	Slow movement of this system will result in several days of tropical downpours for parts of India and Sri Lanka, elevating the risk for flooding.
	As the system tracks northwestward, rain and thunderstorms will become widespread across Sri Lanka into Sunday, while also advancing into eastern Tamil Nadu in southeastern India.
	From Monday through Wednesday, the danger for flooding downpours will shift westward and encompass much of Tamil Nadu, Kerala and southern Karnataka. Additional heavy rain may also continue to stream into western Sri Lanka, while expanding northward along the coast of Andhra Pradesh.
	Rainfall amounts in excess of 100 mm (4 inches) are possible in Colombo, Chennai and Madurai with flooding downpours possible in Coimbatore, Bengaluru and Kochi.
	Flooding will be the primary concern with this tropical threat; however, localized damaging winds are possible in thunderstorms.
	In the longer range, the system could track into the Arabian Sea where there will be a higher likelihood for development into an organized tropical cyclone.(accuweather)
