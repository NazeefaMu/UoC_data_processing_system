A student of a leading school in Colombo, studying for his Advanced Level Examination, who with the help of four outsiders beat up a fellow student, were taken into custody by the Narahenpita police on Tuesday (03)

It is believed that the feud had begun as a result of the student who was the victim of the beating trying to be funny with the girlfriend of the student who initiated the attack, police said.

After being informed about the unwanted advances of this student, her boyfriend went into a rage and decided to take revenge. He had enlisted the help of some of his friends from Borella, amongst whom were thugs and drug addicts, and they arrived at the school in a hybrid car and two three-wheelers and had proceeded to beat up their target.

When they were informed of the the police acted immediately and took the main culprit into custody along with the car and the three-wheelers they had arrived in. After questioning it was found that the car belonged to the main culprit's mother who had earlier served time for trafficking heroin. The rest of the attackers were subsequently arrested as well.

Investigations were being carried out on the instructions of Colombo- SSP Palitha Panamaldeniya and ASP Roshan Dias. (Srinath Prasanna Jayasuriya)
