Bringing Sri Lanka to the limelight and making her proud, Senior Registrar in Gastrointestinal Surgery attached to the Teaching Hospital, Kandy Dr. Nadeesha Jeevan Nawarathna is yet another brilliant mind that has done a tremendous service to the nation as a seasoned, medical professional. Dr. Nawarathna is the first Sri Lankan surgeon to win a prestigious award from the esteemed, Royal College of Surgeons, Edinburgh following the successful completion of the MRCS Edinburgh exams, which stand for the Membership to the Royal College of Surgeons Edinburgh.

Dr. Nawarathna who was educated during his primary years in a remote village in Puttalam was a promising student hailing from Dutugemunu Vidyalaya, Puttalam. Reminiscing his academic years, Dr. Nawarathna said that he got through the grade 5 scholarship, thereby gaining eligibility to enter the St. Sylvester’s College, Kandy. Following the successful completion of the Advanced Level Examination in 2003 with best results in school, he managed to enter the Faculty of Medicine, University of Peradeniya in 2004, in his very first attempt.  


This is the first time a Sri Lankan surgeon was awarded this medal. A qualified doctor with a MBBS or a MB will be eligible to sit for this exam. This exam is basically conducted to gain entry into the UK Postgraduate Training Programme


He who got through his MBBS with flying colours and a specialization in subjects like Microbiology, passed out from University in 2009 and started internship as a surgical trainee in 2011. Speaking to Daily Mirror, he said that during this time he was attached to the University of Rajarata for a few months while also been engaged in several other researches.“Soon as I completed my internship, I sat for the Surgery Exam Part 1 and got through the exam in my first attempt. I was also attached to the Postgraduate Institute of Medicine as a surgical trainee. After three and-a-half years of surgical training also known as the Registrar Period, which includes registrar in surgery, I sat for the MB Surgery Exam Part 2 and became the second in merit order. Meantime, I did a lot of researches as well and recently I got a travel grant from Asia Pacific Digestive Week in 2018. Of the seventy travel grants that were offered, I have received one. Accordingly, I’ll be visiting South Korea in November” Dr. Nawarathna added.  



Explaining about the Royal College of Surgeons in England, he said that basically they are three Colleges in England. The Royal College of Surgeons, England, Royal College of Surgeons, Glasgow and the Royal College of Surgeons, Edinburgh. “I sat for MRCS exam in 2017 August and was awarded the  Pradeep Dutta Medal by the Royal College of Surgeons Edinburgh. This medal is awarded for the surgeon who has achieved the highest mark in the MRCS Edinburgh and the candidate should also meet the criteria of being from a SAARC country. Explaining about Dr. Pradeep Dutta, he said that  Dutta’s origin is from India and Calcutta to be specific. “He was practicing as a surgeon in UK and was a very good teacher. Dr. Dutta  has done an enormous service to the Royal College of Surgeons, Edinburgh. He has served a long duration and has done a good service to all prospective candidates who sat for this exam. Currently, Dr. Dutta is living in a remote area in the UK and I am planning to visit him in future” Dr. Nawaeathna said.  

“This is the first time a Sri Lankan surgeon was awarded this medal. A qualified doctor with a MBBS or a MB will be eligible to sit for this exam. This exam is basically conducted to gain entry into the UK Postgraduate Training Programme. I have obtained the membership in two Colleges out of the three; that is the Royal College of Surgeons Glasgow and in the Royal College of Surgeons, Edinburgh. If a doctor needs to obtain his or her post graduate training in UK, it is vital to have at least one membership out of these three Colleges. I’m very proud to say that up to now I have not given into any delay in my work and within a minimum age, I have managed to achieve everything” Dr. Navarathna concluded.
