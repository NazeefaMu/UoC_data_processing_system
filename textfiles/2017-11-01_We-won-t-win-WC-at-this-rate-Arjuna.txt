If cricket in Sri Lanka was not pulled out of the rut it is in now, it would be impossible to win the World Cup in 2019, former test captain and Minister of Petroleum Resources Development Arjuna Ranatunga said.

Speaking to a group of journalists, the former skipper complained that the issue was not the players but the management of the sport who made decisions on popularity. “I am not worried about the players, they are talented. However, the people in the management are not those who can manage the team properly,” he said.

Reminding those present that his predictions about the sport in the country had never been wrong, the Minister said that it would be difficult to win the next World Cup held in the unfamiliar and rather difficult play turf of England.

“The players need to be mentally prepared to play for the country. I have informed the highest authorities of the country of this situation but I am yet to receive a favourable reply, if they do nothing this will be the government that watched cricket die,” he said.
