In a letter to Speaker Karu Jayasuriya, President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday rejected the No-Confidence Motion (NCM) brought against his nominee for Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa and the Government.

In his letter, the President said proper procedures were not followed as was required by the Constitution and with regard to Standing Orders when submitting the No-Confidence Motion against the Prime Minister to Parliament.

President Sirisena said the NCM was thus passed without adhering proper parliamentary procedures.

The President shall appoint as Prime Minister the Member of Parliament, who, in the President’s opinion, is most likely to command the confidence of Parliament”, the letter read. The opinion of the President cannot be questioned or tested. He is expected to evaluate the prevailing situation and decide on the person best suited for the country.

It also said that there was no requirement as part of parliamentary proceedings or on the part of the prime minister to show a majority in parliament.

The President said he had also noted an attempt by the Speaker to send the documents of the Motion which announced that the No-Confidence Motion brought against Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa and the Government had been passed in Parliament without a signature and had not been approved by Parliament.
