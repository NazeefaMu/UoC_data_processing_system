Callous bid to exploit her distress


	



 

This lady’s younger brother had gone missing about one year ago leaving no trace. Police had assured her from time to time that they were investigating the disappearance pursuing whatever lead they happened to stumble on. 

 


However, recently on hearing that the Police had suddenly dropped their investigations, the lady decided to air her grievance to a deputy purohita representing the district. She had actively campaigned for this deputy at the last general poll and expected him to help her in the matter. 
When the lady called at the deputy’s political office, the politico was away and she explained the purpose of her visit to the deputy’s private secretary. 


“Akka, we all are now busy campaigning for our candidates. And we are about to go canvassing. Why don’t you join us as you have done before?  We can look for your ‘malli’ once this election is over!” The private secretary’s callous disregard for the purpose of her visit had got her goat and berated him in choice Sinhala, they say.
