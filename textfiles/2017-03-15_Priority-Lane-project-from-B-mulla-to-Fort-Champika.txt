The Priority Lane pilot project might be implemented from Battaramulla to Fort, the Minister of Megapolis and Western Development said.

The pilot project carried out in Rajagiriya allocates a lane for passenger buses as a solution to the heavy traffic congestion in the area. The trial will be conducted for a period of one week and will conclude on March 19.

Implemented at the Sri Jayawardenapura Kotte Municipal Council area from the Ayurvedic Junction, Rajagiriya, the plan was not effective on the first day of implementation. However, officials said the traffic condition in the area had vastly improved since, as motorists are now aware of the regulation and are following instructions set out by the authorities.

Speaking to the media, Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said they faced practical issues on the first two days but were able to launch the project on its third day with minor tweaks. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
