He found the familiar toilet in a filthy state


	



 

A large number of purohitas and Diyawanna members attended the yahapalanaya anniversary celebration held in Matara recently. 

 


One of the purohitas who once had close ties to the defence establishment felt the need to go to the toilet while the public function was underway.  He was walking towards a public convenience at the Jayasuriya grounds when he suddenly remembered a familiar toilet at the nearby army camp. 


The purohita who walked up to the toilet found to his chagrin that it was closed. His annoyance turned into a fury when he later found the toilet in a filthy state.


After relieving himself with much distaste, the purohita reprimanded the authorities at the camp for turning a blind eye to the horrid state of the toilet. 


“I propose to come this way soon. Let things be in a better shape by then,” was his parting shot.
