DPA, 03rd JULY, 2018
 Iran keeps its promises, President Hassan Rouhani said Tuesday in Switzerland, ahead of a planned meeting between the chief diplomats from Tehran and five key countries focused on salvaging a 2015 deal to set controls on Iran’s nuclear programme.


“In these times, problems can only be solved through close cooperation between governments and peoples,” the Iranian leader told a press conference in Bern after meeting his Swiss counterpart, Alain Berset.


“When we promise something, we honour that promise - like the nuclear deal and our cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA],” he said.


Chief diplomats from Iran and five major powers are planning to meet on Friday in Vienna to find a way to salvage the deal, Iranian news agency IRNA reported.
