The Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID) will not be dissolved, though some people make speculations on that regard, the government assured yesterday.

Deputy Minister of Power and Energy, Ajith P. Perera said that there was no need to dissolve the FCID. “Investigations conducted by the Division will continue,” he said.

Commenting on JVP MP Sunil Handunneththi’s statement that the FCID would be dissolved at the end of the month, the Deputy Minister said the Division was conducting more than 40 investigations at the moment.

“The files have been sent to the Attorney General and we have also filed about six cases in Court. This statement is baseless. I can confidently say the FCID will not be dissolved,” he said. FCID will not be dissolved: Govt. (Darshana Sanjeewa)
