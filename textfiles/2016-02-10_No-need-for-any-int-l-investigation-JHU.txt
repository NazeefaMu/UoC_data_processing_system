No need for any int’l investigation: JHU


	

The Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) said today there was no need for an international investigation into alleged war crimes during the last stages of the armed conflict because the current government had re-established democracy, good governance and the rule of law.


JHU western provincial councillor Nishantha Sri Warnasinghe said any allegations of war crimes should be investigated through a domestic mechanism because all State institutions under the new government were functioning without political intervention.


“We don’t need an international investigation, foreign judges or technical assistance from western countries because we can resolve all concerns through a domestic mechanism. Today we have independent judiciary, the rule of law and democracy unlike during the Rajapaksa regime,” he said.


He said it was in the aftermath of the international community losing faith in our judiciary and independent institutions that they demanded an international inquiry during the previous regime.


“Former president Mahinda Rajapaksa failed to implement the recommendations of the commissions established to probe war crime allegations but repeatedly acted to neglect the international community resulting in tarnishing the image of the country,” he said.


Mr. Warnasinghe said ex-president Rajapaksa was engaged in achieving political ends through this issue just as he did in the past.


He told a news conference that if an inquiry was held to probe alleged war crimes, action should be taken against the ex- LTTErs who committed war crimes, assassinated political and religious leaders and caused huge destruction to State property. (Ajith Siriwardana)
