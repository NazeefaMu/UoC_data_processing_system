Two Anunayake Theras appointed after 162 years


	

After a lapse of 162 years, two Anunayake Theras were appointed to the Asgiriya Chapter by the Karaka Sangha Sabha led by Asgiriya Mahanayake Most Ven. Galagama Attadassi Thera.
The election was held at the Asgiri Historic Poyage this afternoon, presided over by the Asgiriya Chapter Mahanayake Thera.
The 18-member Karaka Sangha Sabha elected uncontested Ven. Panditha Wendurawe Upali Thera- Trustee of the Historic Polonnaruwa Solosmastana and Ven. Panditha Warakagoda Gunaratna Thera - Trustee of the Historic Muthiyangane Raja Maha Viharaya.
This election of the two Anunayakes was done away with by the British when they found that the Anunayake of the Sath Korale who held the last appointment was against the British. They did not appoint a Anunayke thereafter since all these appointments to the two Maha Vihara's were done by them until 1853.
However, the newly elected Mahanayake Thera of the Asgiriya re-introduced the appointment of the two Anunayake Theras to the Asgiriya chapter. (L.B.Senaratne)
