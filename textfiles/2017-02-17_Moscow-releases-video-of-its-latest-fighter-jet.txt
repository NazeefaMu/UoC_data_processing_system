The Russian Ministry of Defence has released a video of its latest fighter jet in an effort to drive foreign export sales.   


The Kremlin wants foreign governments to buy its latest Sukhoi-35s jet instead of a western aircraft.   
As part of the sales drive, the Russian Air Force released footage of a test pilot taking its Sukhoi Su-35s for a spin. The super sonic jet is being sold as a multi-purpose single-seat fighter with both speed and agility.   


Unlike the F-22 and F-35, the Su-35s is not a stealth fighter and relies far more on dog fighting skills like older aircraft such as the F-16.   


Several cameras have been fitted to the aircraft in the video as it performs a range of high-energy manoeuvres.According to Jane Defence Weekly, China has already purchased 24 SU-35s worth an estimated $2 billion.   

 




The aircraft has a maximum speed of Mach 2.25 at 36,000 feet and carry 8,000kg in weapons with a range of around 1,000.   


Russia claims the aircraft is better than the west’s fourth generation aircraft, such as the US F-16 and French Rafaele and even the RAF’s Typhoon interceptor.   


The Su-35s is fitted with a 30mm cannon for air-to-air dog fighting as well as the capability of carrying rockets, missiles and bombs.
