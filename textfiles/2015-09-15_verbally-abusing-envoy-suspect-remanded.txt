Manjula Weerakoon, who is said to have been involved in verbally abusing and attempting to assault Russian diplomat at supermarket car park in Colombo 2, was produced before the Colombo Fort Magistrate and remanded till September 17.
The man was arrested by the Colombo Crimes Division (CCD) soon after his anticipatory bail application was rejected by Court on Monday.
Magistrate Priyantha Liyanage directed the prison authorities to produce the suspect at an identification parade on Wednesday.
Police are investigating the incident using the video footage posted on Facebook showing a man at the wheel of a BMW blocking the diplomat's car at the car park and verbally abusing him.
The CCD informed Court that the man had committed a serious offence by tarnishing the country’s image. (Lakmal Sooriyagoda)
