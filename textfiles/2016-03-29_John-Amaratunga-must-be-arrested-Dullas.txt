The joint opposition today called for the arrest of Tourism Development, Christian Religious Affairs and Lands Minister John Amaratunga saying he was responsible for the removal of the walking path at Mabola in Wattala.

“Minister Amaratunga admitted to having ordered the removal of the walking path which was built at a cost of Rs.80 million. After I saw the news, I thought he will be arrested under the Public Properties Act or produced in the Negombo Magistrate’s Court. But nothing has happened so far,” joint opposition organiser MP Dullas Alahapperuma said.

He told a news conference in Colombo that this incident was one of the repercussions of the non-functioning of Local Government (LG) bodies. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
