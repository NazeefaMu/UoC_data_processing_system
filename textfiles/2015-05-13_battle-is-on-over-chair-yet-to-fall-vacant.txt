Battle is on, over chair yet to fall vacant!


	


	A ‘do or die battle’ over the highest chair in Police about to fall vacant has already begun, they say.

This battle between two Deputies has given an added significance to the recent news suggesting a lurking security threat to the New Big Boss, small fry in the department say.
There is an obvious choice for the highest chair. However, a Deputy much junior to him is said to be using all tricks in his bag to claim the chair.
The persistent one had made an unsuccessful bid on a previous occasion too. All indications are that he will come a cropper for the second time, they say.
