When I rushed to the hotel I found that everything had been destroyed and shattered while my father was fallen in a pool of blood, with heavy injuries to his head. I lifted him and rushed him to hospital in a vehicle, but he was pronounced dead upon admission. The finger prints of the gangsters and all the footage have been recorded in the CCTV cameras. Therefore I appeal to the President and the law enforcement authorities to mete out justice to us by apprehending the culprits who killed my father,” he said.
