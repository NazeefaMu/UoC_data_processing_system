Digital Technology Development Minister Harin Fernando today said he was not prepared to defend anyone found guilty of fraud by the presidential commission probing the bond issue.

At the same time he said the present government had appointed a commission to probe the bond issue despite allegations against its own self.

Further he charged that some joint opposition MPs have inflicted undue influence on police officers at the Welikada police. "We saw how these MPs behaved at the police station "he said.

'The people were wondering as to whether the government was weak as it tolerated those who were out to sabotage activities of the government' he added.

He said the government had no intention of selling oil tanks while it was only trying to lease them out for a specific time period.(Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)
