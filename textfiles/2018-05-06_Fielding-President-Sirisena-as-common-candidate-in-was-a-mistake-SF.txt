Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka said today that fielding incumbent President Maithripala Sirisena as the common candidate in 2015 was a mistake.

“ I told Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to contest the last presidential election but the party supported a common candidate instead. This was a blunder “ Field Marshal said while addressing the party’s May Day rally.

He said the UNP should make use of the Samurdi and Labour ministries to work for the people. “ Former Labour Minister only focused on bringing former defense secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa to forefront and the former Samurdi minister was only played politics. However we should turn Samurdi as a people’s friendly program” he added.(Yohan Perera)
