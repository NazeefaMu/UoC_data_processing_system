Prime Minister endorses Port City

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday said that Sri Lanka will have "unique financial and business district" in Colombo when the stalled Chinese funded Colombo Port City project resumes.
"Hopefully if the Port City project gets underway - there will be some sort of landfill there - that could have the makings of a special financial and business district which will be a unique one in South Asia," Wickremesinghe said addressing an event held to mark the 30th anniversary of the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE).
The controversial project which commenced under the last regime ran into troubled waters as the then opposition and activists questioned the viability.
Following the January 8 election the project was put on hold until additional assessments were conducted and approval given by the previous government were re-evaluated.
Further the government this week announced that the supplementary Environmental Impact Assessment study of the project has been submitted to Coast Conservation and Coastal Resource Management Department.
The report is accessible for the public in 11 different government institutions, where the public can study the report and make submissions within 30 days from December 1.
