Govt will implement all pledges - PM

 
The government will keep to all the pledges given to the people, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe delivering a special statement in Badulla, on Saturday said.
He said that the national government was formed as the people wanted such a government and added that the people also expected a government which thinks differently.
"So far one party remained in power under party politics and no solutions were provided to the problems faced by the public. But the present government has begun to think differently with new ideas. It is our responsibility to work with the people," the Prime Minister said.
The Premier also emphasised the the necessity of creating a democratic society with all respecting each other.
"We should ensure the rights of all Sri Lankans. Then only we can create a better society and the world will accept us," he said.
Singing the National Anthem in Tamil is not an issue as both Sinhala and Tamil national anthems have been mentioned in the Constitution. The government had also taken an important measure to increase the female representation in politics and parliament.
But the pro-Rajapaksa group had caused a commotion in parliament when the Bill was tabled.
Their behaviour proved that they have no genuine concern for the country's women or their rights, the Prime Minister said. He said that pro-Rajapaksa group is only concerned about their own representation.
Referring to a harmful comment made on the TV recently, on the Danno Budunge song which was sung at a musical show to mark the Independence Day, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said that stern action will be taken against electronic media stations who exceed their limit by insulting women in an unpleasant manner.
"Media institutions are not properties of their owners. They belong to the citizens of the country, of which nearly 52 percent are women. If media insults women, then they do not respect the majority of the population," the Premier said.
He said that anybody has freedom to criticize positively or negatively or praise an artistic performance of a person. But there is no freedom to attack a person in abusive language," he said.
The government would not tolerate any verbal attacks on individuals by the media, the Premier warned.
"During the previous regime, media personalities were told to attack those opposing the government or the rulers and their families. There seems to be remnants belonging to that era still haunting.
They cannot practice their habits under this government," Wickremesinghe said.
The Prime Minister said the government would sternly implement the selection criteria when issuing transmission licenses to electronic media, taking into consideration any unethical conduct.
Commenting on the criticism levelled at the opera singer, he said he would inquire from heads of the relevant television station whether they have conducted a disciplinary inquiry over the controversial statement.
He also added that the government will not allow the media to attack individuals, women, religions or ethnicities. It is time the media conducted their work in a professional and ethical manner.
The government will take a more exacting path after discussions with Telecommunication Regulatory Commission officials when issuing the transmission license to electronic media, the Prime Minister said.
