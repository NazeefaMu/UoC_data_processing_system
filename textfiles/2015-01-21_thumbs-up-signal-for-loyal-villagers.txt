	The Tangalle residence of the deposed Big Boss is teeming with sympathizers these days.

They say that he had to address the crowds using the mega phone 13 times before leaving for Colombo last week. Meanwhile, a sore throat was bothering him.
On his way back to Colombo, the former Big Boss stopped the vehicle on seeing an old friend among some villagers plucking coconuts on a wayside estate. Villagers on recognizing the distinguished wayfarer offered him ‘Kurumba’ water. Within minutes the former Big Boss found himself surrounded by a large group of sympathetic villagers. After giving vent to their poignant feelings, villagers began asking questions relating to his political future. In reply, the former Big Boss raised his hand with two fingers forming the letter ‘V’ and the villagers applauded. He resumed his journey amid The cheers from villagers.
