The Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) members in the joint opposition (JO) and the members of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) will jointly contest the upcoming elections, SLPP Chairman G.L. Peiris said today.

He told a news conference that the two parties would not contest these elections under the hand symbol of the SLFP.

Professor Peiris said people had sent a clear message at the JO May Day rally held at the Galle Face Green that they had no trust in the SLFP.

“The SLFP is an appendage of the United National Party (UNP) and its policies. Today, steps are being made to convert the country's six largest corporations into private companies. Alienation and privatization are not SLFP policies,” he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
