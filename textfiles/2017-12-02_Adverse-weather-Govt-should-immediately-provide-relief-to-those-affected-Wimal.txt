With most of the country still reeling from the effects of the inclement weather condition, it is the responsibility of the government to look into the needs of those who were affected and provide them relief without delay, National Freedom Front (NFF) Leader MP Wimal Weerawansa said.

In a media release put out by the party, MP Weerawansa said more than 20,000 people from 11 districts had been affected by the adverse weather while 7 deaths had also been reported while 23 persons reported missing.

“It seems that the government is just going through the motions when it comes to managing the relief operations and is more interested in showing off to the media whereas what they should be doing is being proactive and make sure relief operations take place in an effective manner,” Weerawansa stressed.

He charged that the civic minded people of this country were assisting those affected by this calamity more than the government was which was a shame. (Sheain Fernandopulle)
