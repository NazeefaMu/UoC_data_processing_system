India-Pakistan may play in SL or Bangladesh?


	


	 
Calcutta: The possibility of a bilateral cricket series between India and Pakistan in either Sri Lanka or Bangladesh cannot be ruled out.
 
At the bilateral level, the two countries have not played each other since January 2013.
 
According to well-placed sources of The Telegraph, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) is actively looking at playing in one of the two neighbouring countries.
 
Shashank Manohar, the BCCI president, is also the chairman of the International Cricket Council, which is headquartered in Dubai. He’s got to keep the bigger picture in mind as well.
 
The MoU between the BCCI and the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) was signed when Narayanswami Srinivasan was at the helm on this side of the border.
 
Going by the MoU, India’s committed to playing Pakistan and the next series would have the status of ‘home’ for the PCB.
 
Once things firm up, a formal proposal would be placed before the PCB, which is headed by a former foreign secretary, Shaharyar Khan.
 
Khan’s roots, incidentally, are in India.
 
Manohar and Shaharyar are expected to meet in Dubai on Saturday/ Sunday. While the former has left for the Emirate in his capacity as chairman of the world body, Shaharyar is there for the ongoing Pakistan-England matches.
 
The UAE has become Pakistan’s home venue after the attack (in Lahore) on the Sri Lanka team bus, in March 2009.
 
Thus far, the Indian and Pakistani Boards have rejected each other’s proposals. Both sides have left no scope for any compromise on their publicly stated positions.
 
 
India have said “no” to playing in the UAE; Pakistan’s stand has been the same on again touring India.
 
The 2012-13 face-offs were hosted by India.
 
As it’s supposed to be a home series for the PCB, they’ll obviously look at the revenue model before saying ‘yes’ to either Sri Lanka or Bangladesh.
 
Both Sri Lanka and Bangladesh don’t have a home series between the first week of December and the first few days of January – the period during which India and Pakistan are supposed to play each other.
 
If India and Pakistan do agree to revive bilateral cricket on neutral ground (after the mandatory clearances from New Delhi and Islamabad), then the matches can be played in either Sri Lanka or Bangladesh.
 
Sri Lanka appears the more likely venue, as the BPL would be on till December 15. Then, Bangladesh are to host a Test series against Zimbabwe from January 5 or thereabouts.
 
Besides, there have been security-related issues in recent times, with Australia even deferring their tour of Bangladesh.
 
As far too many factors come into play, in relations between India and Pakistan, one can’t predict anything with certainty. However, both Sri Lanka and Bangladesh would be delighted to host such a high-profile contest.
 
India and Pakistan, by the way, have to reach Australia and New Zealand, respectively, by January 8.(The Telegraph)
