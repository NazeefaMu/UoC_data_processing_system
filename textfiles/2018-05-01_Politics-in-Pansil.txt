Politics in ‘Pansil’


	



 

There is a Pohottuwa-run local body ruling certain ‘Kandiya’ in Ampara district where the new administration has now made it a practice to start the day’s business after observing ‘Pansil’.

 


By the way, all members of the Sabha are Buddhists. 


However, the members of the opposition despite all being Buddhists do not participate in the observance of this religious practice because the bhikkhu administering ‘Pansil’ happens to be member elected on the rival Pohottuwa ticket, they say.
