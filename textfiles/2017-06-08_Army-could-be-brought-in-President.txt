President Maithripala Sirisena warned that he will hand over the task of arresting the trend of religious and communal violence to the army if the police are unable to apprehend those who perpetrate these crimes.

The President said this when he met Government Ministers and MPs at the Parliamentary complex last afternoon.

“These violent acts are being carried out by a group that is backed by the opposition. Why don’t you tell the people who is behind these incidents,” he had challenged the MPs present.

Presidents had said this in reply to a complaint made to him by UNP MP Mujubur Rahaman that the government had failed to arrest those who promote religious and communal hatred. ( Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)
