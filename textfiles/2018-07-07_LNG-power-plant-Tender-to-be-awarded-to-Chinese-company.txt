A team of experts have pointed out that the possible energy crisis in 2020 would take a turn for the worse, if the tender for the LNG plant in Kerawalapitiya was delayed any further.

Though the project was to be implemented this year, uncertainty remains whether it could be done because of the delay in awarding the tender.

These experts have informed the Cabinet that the power plant was expected to add 300 megawatts of electricity to the national grid.

Locally-based Lakdanavi, had submitted a lower bid for the project but the Ministry had decided to award the contract to a Chinese company. Lakdanavi is known to be carrying out power projects in different countries.
