Everything in the world,Is naturally not lasting...Take anything. Any Thing.Can you name. Any Thing,Animate or Inanimate,That is of an unchanging nature?Take a human. He is born.He ages... and he has to die.Take an inanimate thing,Like a mirror...It is fragile...It can break... Wood Rots...
Seasons change... and so do ourThoughts ... and Emotions...Nothing ... Including ourselves,Is permanent. The only permanentReality, is Impermanence.
