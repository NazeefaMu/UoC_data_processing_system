A CONCERT IN MEMORY OF DAYAN


	

A concert of Chamber and Choral Music featuring some of the leading performers in the field of classical music will be held on September 1.


The concert is being held in memory of an outstanding musician, Dayananda Fernando (Dayan), who passed away in 2016.
Dayan was a unique musician in that he played and taught both string (violin, viola) and wind (flute, bassoon) instruments. He was the principal bassoonist of the Symphony Orchestra of Sri Lanka for many years. He could also play the piano and taught this instrument as well.
The concert commences with two piano pieces written by Sarath Fernando (Brother of Dayan) named Nocturne and Novelette and will be performed by Anoma Fernando.
This will be followed by violinist Ananda Dabare performing the wistful Serenade melancolique by Tchaikovsky and the technically demanding Zigeunerweisen (Gypsy Airs) by Pablo Sarasate.
He will be accompanied by Ramya de Livera Perera on the piano.
