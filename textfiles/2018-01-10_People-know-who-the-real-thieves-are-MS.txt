President Maithripala Sirisena said today even though two factions accused in Parliament each other of being thieves, people know who the real thieves were.

“Just as a pick-pocket calls out “there is a thief, there is a thief” while he is snatching someone’s purse, two factions in Parliament today accused each other of being thieves. But people know who the real thieves are,” the President said addressing a rally in Anuradhapura.
