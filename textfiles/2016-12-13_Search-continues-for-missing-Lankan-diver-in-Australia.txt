A search is underway in Upper Ord River, Australia where a 28 year old Sri Lankan went missing after cliff jumping, Australian media reported.

The friends of a Sri Lankan man who disappeared in the Upper Ord River while cliff jumping thought he was “mucking around” when his body briefly resurfaced after taking a 19 to 20m plunge.

Senior Sergeant Steve Principe said 28-year-old Oshan Janaka Kumara Jayasooriya Mudiyanselag, known around Kununurra as Oshan Janaka, had travelled up river to Carlton Gorge with four friends on Sunday morning at about 10am. “They were there to have a jump off the cliff face,” he said.

“He jumped off the top feet first and gone straight under and stayed there for up to 20 seconds and was seen to float back, arms out, faced down on top of the water and sunk straight after that. “His friends thought he was mucking around,” he added.
