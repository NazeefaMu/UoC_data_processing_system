Rs. 2 billion is chicken feed for him!


	



 

This big-mouthed politico is a member of the top team. He is Blue, but ready to turn Green if need be.

 


He had been lately seen frequenting the Kandy area.


He had not been visiting the sacred city just for the fun of it. He is reportedly interested in purchasing a prime property about three acres in extent worth about Rs. 2 billion which he had considered as an ideal spot for a big business venture.


The deal, they say, is about to be wrapped up. But, to quote what a Green colleague of his had recently remarked, he is not a fool to buy the property in his name. There is a front-man set to sign the documents on his behalf!


The question now teasing those who are in the know of this land deal is how this dude who made it to Diyawanna through the list after losing his seat, could make a fortune to buy a property worth so much.


Informed sources say that this is only the prologue. What is more interesting is the story to follow!
