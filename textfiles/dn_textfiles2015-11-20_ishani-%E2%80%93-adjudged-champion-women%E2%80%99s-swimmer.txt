Ishani – adjudged champion women’s swimmer

Twenty two year old Ishani Senanayake of Sri Lanka Army was adjudged the champion women's swimmer at the National Swimming Championship organised by the Sri Lanka Aquatic Sports Union (SLASU) and worked off at the Sugathadasa Stadium Swimming Complex in Colombo.
Ishani Senanayake though still very young is a much heralded swimmer having several meet and national records to her credit. She had her initial eduction at Samudra Devi Balika Vidyalaya where she cut her teeth in swimming before going over to Sirimavo Balika Vidyalaya for her Advance Levels where her rough edges were cut. There is swimming in her family as her elder sister Niyathamani is a top swimmer and now an officer with the Sri Lanka Army. At school level she set up many records and won a large haul of medals.
At this National Swimming Championship 2015 she won three gold medals, one silver and one bronze.
What is most remarkable about her performance was that she was indisposed three days before the championship which continued up to the day of the meet and was in two minds whether to compete or not, as she will not be able to give out her best. She was persuaded by her mother to participate who said that winning or losing does not matter and armed with some of her personal best timings that she could not lose much.
Her swimming coach Manoj Abysinghe further encouraged her to compete and the rest of the talking was done by her swimming. Her meet timings is as follows:
800 metres free style 10.07 mts Gold Medal.
400 metres free style 4.50 mts. Gold Medal.
200 metres free style 2.17 mts. Gold Medal.
200 metres back stroke 2.27 mts. Silver Medal.
200 metres Beast stroke 3.05 mts Bronze Medal.
With dehydration troubling her, she could not go for record timing or better her personal best but with will and determination she was able to grab three first places and was also adjudged the “Best Women Swimmer of the meet” No doubt a great achievement considering the circumstances she was placed in.
Free Style appears to be her forte and winning the 800 metres even she gave an object lesson and with strong will and steel nerves one could overcome these hurdles.
She is now training for the next South Asian Games in New Delhi, India. This little girl with her father in the hospital bed for a long time is determined to make him happy with her performance, though complete recovery at this stage could be a ‘shot in the dark'.
This is Ishani Senanayake always sporting a smile and adversity could not put her down easily. She is a brave girl with her mother and sister to support her and of course with the blessings of her bed ridden father. This writer met her in April this year and since then through words of encouragement she has come a long way.
