The pitch of the Galle International Cricket Ground, which was allegedly altered as a result of an alleged pitch-fixing incident, is being removed to lay a new pitch.

Earlier, a documentary of the Al Jazeera revealed that two Test matches, Sri Lanka versus India in July last year and Sri Lanka versus Australia in August 2016 played at the Galle International Stadium were ‘fixed.’(Pix by D.G. Sugathapala)
