Everyone will fear former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa if he comes to power, Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake said yesterday.


Ramanayake came out with this sentiment in response to a statement made by Minister Mangala Samaraweera that he fear's former Defence Secretary.


"Won't all of us run away if we find out that there is a person here with a bomb? Aren’t you afraid of Mahasona," he asked journalists.


Quoting former Minister Mervyn Silva, Ramanayake said the former had publicly stated that Mr. Rajapaksa was behind the white van drama during the previous regime. Also he recalled that Mr. Rajapaksa himself had publically stated several years ago that he would hang Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka. He said it is obvious that many become scared of former Defence Secretary when one considers the given circumstance.(Yohan Perera)
