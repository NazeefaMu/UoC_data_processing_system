Newly appointed Police Chief Pujith Jayasundara today said investigations into the alleged murder of Ruggerite Wasim Thajudeen would continue and more suspects would be arrested in the future.

IGP Jayasundara, while assuming duties at the Police Headquarters, said whoever responsible of Thajudeen’s murder will be taken into custody and action would be taken against them regardless of their position or the rank.

“The investigations are continuing step by step. There are no personnel attacks and no attacks on individuals. The probe would be carried out accordingly. We will take action and will not consider any political interference,” he said.

“Everyone is always looking for fast investigations and quick results. There are investigations which can provide results on the spot. But these kind of controversial murder cases should be investigated gradually,” he said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)
