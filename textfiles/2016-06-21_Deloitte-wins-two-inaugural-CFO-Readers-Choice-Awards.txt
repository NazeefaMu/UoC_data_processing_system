CFO Magazine readers have selected Deloitte as its favorite “Accounting Firm” among the Big 4 and favorite “Management Consulting Firms” in CFO Publishing’s inaugural Readers’ Choice Awards.
Editors initially selected companies for inclusion based on extensive, independent, editorial research, which weighed such factors as market share, reported user base, public recognition by technology research firms, and other objective criteria. 
There were a total of 20 award categories for consideration, each containing a maximum of five nominees. At the conclusion of the voting period, over 850 ballots had been received from CFOs, finance executives, and professionals.
“Deloitte is committed to fostering a culture of innovation and playing an essential role in the effective functioning of the capital markets,” Cathy Engelbert, CEO of Deloitte LLP said. “We help clients tackle their toughest challenges and help transform their business in a marketplace where the pace of change is exponential and the environment is increasingly disruptive. Our innovative talent practices and the building of an open talent platform give us continuous access to the best talent. It is a truly exciting time and we thank the readers of CFO for their support and confidence in the Deloitte brand.”
In announcing the award in the June issue of CFO Magazine, CFO Publishing noted Deloitte as a Fortune 100 Best Companies to Work For, the 17th year Deloitte has achieved this accomplishment. In addition, the magazine cites Consulting’s “top five-star ratings” in finance and risk management and Audit’s recent “Audit Innovation of the Year Award.” Deloitte serves approximately 80 percent of US Fortune 500 companies.
