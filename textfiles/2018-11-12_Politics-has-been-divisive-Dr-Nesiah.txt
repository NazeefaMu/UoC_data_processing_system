Politics has been divisive: Dr. Nesiah


	



 

s the Sri Lankan political scene has been taking new turns during the past couple of weeks, people too have begun to voice out their democratic rights.
Some collectively, and some on their own, individual capacities. One individual, who made headlines last week, was Dr Devanesan Nesiah, who decided to return the Deshamanya title bestowed upon him back in 2017 at the Investiture Ceremony of conferring National Honours. 
Educated at CMS Chundikuli Girls’ School and St John’s College, Jaffna Dr Nesiah later moved to study at S. Thomas’ College when his father moved there.


Having joined the Ceylon Civil Service at a very young age, he made it to the 1959 CCS Batch the third batch before CCS’s abolition in 1963. Although Dr Nesiah was a Class One Grade One SLAS Officer, he often served at lower positions and it was after many recommendations that he was appointed Government Agent in Jaffna and a new post of District Secretary.
Having served under President Ranasinghe Premadasa and ministers such as Vincent Perera and Srimani Athulathmudali, Dr Nesiah has witnessed a greater part of the political turmoil from back then. In honour of his contribution to the civil service, he was conferred with the prestigious Deshamanya title last year.
However, following the recent outbreak of political events, Dr Nesiah recently wrote an open letter to the President himself.

 



	"My decision isn’t one that I’ve taken lightly, or in haste
	
	
	I can no longer take pride in the title of Deshamanya
	
	
	I have no option but to return my treasured medal and certificate"
	


He penned the letter as follows:
“As a loyal and patriotic Sri Lankan but I see no alternative to regretfully return the Deshamanya medal and certificate that you awarded me. Your Excellency, my decision isn’t one that I’ve taken lightly, or in haste. To always act in accordance with my principles is a burden that I’ve embraced with pride for nearly 60 years since I first enrolled as a cadet in the Ceylon Civil Service.
“My long career in the civil service was often stymied under both UNP and SLFP regimes for my refusal to compromise my values. Since I can no longer take pride in the title of Deshamanya that you’ve conferred on me, I have no option but to return my treasured medal and certificate.”
Speaking to the Daily Mirror Dr Nesiah recalled some experiences while working as a civil servant and shared his views about the reconciliation process.
Excerpts:

Why were you interested to join the civil service at a young age?

The Ceylon Civil Service rules prescribed that men could enter at age 22 or 23, neither earlier nor later.

In reference to a write up written by Prof. Ratnajeevan Hoole, it states that although you were a Class 1 SLAS Officer, you had positions at lower levels. Why did it happen that way?

The late Felix Dias Bandaranaike established an institution called the ‘Pool’ to which Public Servants who refused to carry out irregular directions were assigned.  If there was no breach of the law, they could not be dismissed from office.  The Pool deprived them of work and the perks of office (Official vehicle, quarters), the monetary value of which would far exceed the salary of senior officials like myself.  The Pool was greatly expanded under JR.

Can you recollect the experience as GA in Jaffna?

Very taxing and stressful but also greatly rewarding and satisfying.  My recollections are too numerous and varied to elaborate here, in the course of an interview.

You have served as Secretary under President Premadasa and have witnessed most of the political changes. Where do you think did politics take a wrong turn to what it is today?

It is difficult to highlight a singular moment but there were many wrong turns over a very long period, predating the Executive Presidency.

Even after the war has ended, the North and the South don’t seem to be merging. Why should the sharing of knowledge and culture be promoted to strengthen the reconciliation process?

Culturally, our country has always been well integrated but our politics has been divisive.  The Office of National Unity and Reconciliation has great potential that has not yet been realized. 

Is reconciliation an achievable task after all?

Certainly, yes!

How challenging has it been to continue your service as a law-abiding civil servant in Sri Lanka?

The ability to serve as a law-abiding civil servant in Sri Lanka has been fluctuating over time.  My last lap, as a Deputy to Charitha Ratwatte (Then Commissioner General of Essential Services) merging into my service as Secretary under Minister Vincent Perera, ending under Minister Srimani Athulathmudali, was relatively unproblematic.

Your decision to give up the Deshamanya title was one-of-a-kind. What is your ultimate message to the people?

We had a long and proud history of over two millennia. We need to regain that tradition within the framework of a united Sri Lanka.
