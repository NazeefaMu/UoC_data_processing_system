The United National Party (UNP) will on Monday take up for discussions the 20th Amendment to the Constitution submitted by the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) on the abolishing of the executive presidential system, House Leader and Minister Lakshman Kiriella said yesterday.

The JVP-sponsored 20th Amendment had been included in the gazette and will be be placed on the Order Paper of Parliament after discussions with Speaker Karu Jayasuriya and the party leaders at the Parliament's Business Committee Meeting.

It will be then presented in Parliament by JVP MP Vijitha Herath as a private member’s bill and referred to the relevant ministry by the Speaker in keeping with the new Standing Orders adopted by Parliament.

Mr. Herath told Daily Mirror Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe would be the subject minister in this instance.

“The Prime Minister can take up to six months to decide on the bill,” he said. (Kelum Bandara)
