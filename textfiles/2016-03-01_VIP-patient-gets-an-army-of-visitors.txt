Over 100 well-wishers have already visited a prominent Sri Lankan politician currently undergoing treatment in a hospital in a foreign country.

Political friends from countries like Indonesia, Malaysia and India have been among the visitors who have already been at his bedside. The well-wishers from Sri Lanka had travelled abroad to visit the politician at their own expense, they say. Given the steady increase in the number of visitors, the hospital authorities have decided to shift the politician to a more spacious ward.
