A landmark occasion

Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake arrived in the House yesterday with the budget proposals for the financial year 2016 to a grand ovation by government members.
It was the longest budget presented by Finance minister Ravi Karunanayake recently which lasted for four and half hours. Parliament met
at 2 pm presided by Speaker Karu Jayasuriya and after the presentation of papers, Chief Government Whip Gayantha Karunathilaka commenced the Second Reading of the Appropriation Bill. On the invitation of Speaker Jayasuriya, Finance Minister Karunanayake entered the House with the budget proposals to the applause of ministers, deputy ministers and government MPs.
The minister then delivered his budget speech amid desk thumping by the government benches.
The minister noted that this budget was the Independent Sri Lanka's 70th budget.
This is the first full budget of the national unity government and a landmark occasion in the country's post independent history, when the two main parties have presented a combined budget for the first time today.
The Finance Minister assured the government that he remains firmly committed to fulfilling the people's aspirations for a decent living, a clean environment and a better life for their children.
He said it was with that commitment, he was presenting the budget. Some proposals in the budget were not read by the minister, were tabled instead to save the time.
Minister Minister Karunanayake concluded his Budget speech at 6.25pm. After Parliament was adjourned, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya invited government and opposition members for the traditional budget day tea party.
