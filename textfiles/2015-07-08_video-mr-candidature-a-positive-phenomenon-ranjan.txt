The candidature of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa at the general elections should be considered as a positive phenomenon, United National Party member Ranjan Ramanayake said today.
Mr. Ramanayake told a media briefing that President Maithripala Sirisena should be thanked if the former President was given nomination as he would be providing slogans and a proper rival at the election if the latter was given the ticket.
The former UNP MP said he hoped Mr. Rajapaksa would contest from the Gamapaha District as he could be a direct rival to the former President in such a scenario.
“Former President‘s action to contest the election to become an MP is like doing Ordinary Level examination after sitting for the Advanced Level examination,” he said.(Yohan Perera and Darshana Sanjeewa)
