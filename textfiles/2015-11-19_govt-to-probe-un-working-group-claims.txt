The government will investigate claims made by the United Nations Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances (UNWGEID) including claims of a ‘secret’ detention centre operated in Trincomalee where detainees had been allegedly tortured, the Foreign Ministry said today.
Ministry Spokesperson Mahishini Colonne said the UNWGEID had briefed Ministry officials on the conclusions and findings of their investigation prior to making the revelations to the media on Wednesday.
“During the discussions held with the ministry, the working group briefed us on their findings inclusive of certain cells maintained in the past. They don’t exist anymore. We have told them that the government is willing to investigation whatever the incidents of intimidation and harassment that existed and consider what measures should be taken after further consultations,” Ms. Colonne told the weekly news briefing of the Ministry.
She said matters of such nature should be dealt with sensitivity because they involved family members of the victims, who are a vulnerable population. She said the government, at the end of the conclusions of the investigations, would decide as to what action should be taken to prevent such incidents from happening in future.
Ms. Colonne said the members of the UNWGEID were given access to all the locations they wished to visit and to meet any of the people they hoped to meet.
“The members of the UN group were quite impressed and surprised at the way they were received by Sri Lanka this time. They were given complete access during their visit in the country. They said they haven’t experienced full access in most of the countries,” she said adding all the security forces including the police have assisted the working group.
