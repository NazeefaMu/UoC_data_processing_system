No one knows why he was not invited!


	



 

A key conference was held the other day at the yahapalanaya nerve centre to take stock of the Uma Oya issue with a view to finding an interim solution to it. 

 


All interested parties including the representatives of the people directly affected and even the vociferous ‘red’ firebrand from Uva had attended the conference on invitation.


However, highly conspicuous by his absence at this conference was the Green party Diyawanna member representing the worst devastated area and no official source was able to say whether the failure to invite the Diyawanna member was by design or by accident. 


Affronted by the cold shoulder given to him, the Diyawanna member has decided to remain an independent in the council hereafter. He has announced this decision in public.
