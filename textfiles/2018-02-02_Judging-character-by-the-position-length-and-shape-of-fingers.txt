In some previous articles we have discussed the characteristics of the fingers. In this article, we propose to discuss more significations relating fingers based on their position, length and shape.
We, laymen, normally refer to five fingers on the hand. But for palmists there are only four fingers, because they do not count the Thumb as a finger. They honour the Thumb with separate and distinct treatment in Palmistry. One renowned palmist says: “The Thumb is about the importance to the hand as the nose is to the face.”


Now let us examine the position of each finger in relation to other fingers.
