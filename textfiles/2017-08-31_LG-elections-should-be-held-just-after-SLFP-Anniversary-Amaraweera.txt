It was better to have the Local Government (LG) Election after completing the Sri Lanka Freedom Party’s (SLFP) 66th Anniversary, UPFA General Secretary and Minister, Mahinda Amaraweera said.

While addressing the media at the SLFP weekly media briefing at the SLFP Head Quarters today he said as SLFPers they did not have an idea to postpone the elections.

“It is better to have the election, even in next month as soon as finishing the SLFP anniversary. What ever happened in the country the election should be held,” he said.

He said that there would be some difficulties for the Elections Commissioner regarding the elections but they would help him. (Chaturanga Pradeep)
