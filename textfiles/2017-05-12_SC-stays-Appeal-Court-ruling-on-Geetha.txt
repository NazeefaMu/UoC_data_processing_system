The Supreme Court today issued a stay order on the Court of Appeal judgment, which stated that UPFA MP Geetha Kumarasinghe was not qualified to hold her post in parliament, until May 15.

The case filed by the counsels of Ms. Kumarasinghe was fixed for trial for Monday. The Court of Appeal ruling said Kumarasinghe was not qualified to function as an MP due to her dual-citizenship status.

Meanwhile, Secretary General of parliament informed the Elections Commission that Kumarasinghe had been removed from her post as a parliamentarian from the Galle district in line with the Court of Appeal verdict. (S.S. Selvanayagam)
