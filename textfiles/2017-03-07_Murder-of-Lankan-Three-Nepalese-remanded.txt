Murder of Lankan: Three Nepalese remanded


	

Three Nepalese men have been remanded in custody over a northern suburbs murder that allegedly left a Sri Lankan victim face down in a pool of his own blood.

In the Elizabeth Magistrates Court on Monday, prosecutors successfully applied to have the identities of all three alleged murderers suppressed to safeguard the ongoing police investigation.

The identity of the victim has also been suppressed — because Major Crime detectives have yet to locate his family in Sri Lanka and inform them of his death.

Police have alleged that a man, 39, man was killed at Penfield Gardens, north of Adelaide on Friday night.

They have further alleged the man’s housemate had to flee for his life through barbed-wire ­fences from a group of up to six assailants.

Eye witnesses claim the “distraught and wailing” housemate was found bleeding, and on the verge of collapse, at the front of the property.

They said he was hanging on the barbed-wire yelling “someone’s got to help, they killed my mate”.

A neighbour said he had entered the house and found the 39-year-old laying dead and face down in a pool of blood.

Police subsequently arrested a man, 44, from Davoren Park, a Northfield man, 34, and a man, 48, of Elizabeth North.

On Monday, none of the men applied for bail and they were remanded in custody to face court again in May. (dailytelegraph)
