Lanka should forge FTA with USA - PM

Sri Lanka's economy is facing tough challenges and to overcome this the country should look at a FTA with USA and also similar economic partnerships with other countries, including India, Singapore and China, said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
Speaking at the annual Business Today Top 20 awards ceremony at Colombo Hilton, Chief guest, the Prime Minister said that Vietnam is emerging as a top performing hub while both Bangladesh and Myanmar are fast becoming low wage manufacturing bases.
"Sri Lanka is fast losing its global competitiveness especially in export earnings and this is a worrying factor. Sri Lankan Tea has lost a major share in the global market," the PM said.
"Only foreign remittances are gaining ground and I hope the political crisis in the Middle East won't have a negative effect to that."
"But on the positive side, Sri Lanka has successfully addressed the EU ban and the GSP issues and the country will receive these benefits again," he said.
