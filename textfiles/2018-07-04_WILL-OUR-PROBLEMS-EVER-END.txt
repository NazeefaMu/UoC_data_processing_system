WILL OUR PROBLEMS EVER END?


	





As I said in my last article, the things that are happening around us today could justifiably be classified as ‘Man’s Inhumanity to Man’!!! Though this disaster does not seem to impact our financial situation, it does impact our lives, because it directly affects the lives of all of us, particularly our children!!! On average parents or adults’ diaries could read as follows: 1,250 Facebook Friends, 588 Twitter Followers, 743 What’s App Friends; and despite all this, when tragedy strikes, the man in the ICU has only his wife and children and his parents outside!!!  

The very people he NEVER HAD TIME FOR!!! ISN’T IT TIME THAT ALL OF US MOVED OUT OF OUR IMAGINARY WORLD AND SPENT SOME REAL TIME WITH OUR FAMILIES AND IN OUR HOMES!!!

 

Nightmare called day-care

 The other horror that most parents are COMPELLED TO LIVE WITH TODAY IS ‘DAY CARE’!!!

Oh yes, ‘DAY CARE’ and OLD AGE HOMES ARE HUGE BUSINESSES TODAY, HUGE!!! A reputed engineering firm has also branched out into ‘DAY CARE’ and horror of horrors, we hear that a little girl had been locked out of this Caring Centre for 4 hours as the parents had a real problem and were unable to come and get her on time!!!

The little girl is pictured in a video that went viral screaming her head off and banging on the door to be let in!!! Hearing her cries the neighbours had called the Police, who came to the rescue!!! Most of the ELDER’S HOMES ARE RUN BY REPUTED DOCTORS; generally speaking, most of the places are well kept though the quality of food leaves much to be desired!!! Complaining does not get you anywhere either!!! Looking at it from a religious point of view, most of the Homes are Buddhist, some Anglican but the same cannot be said for the Catholics!!! The COMPASSION preached by Lord Buddha seems to permeate the culture of the majority of Homes being Buddhist though money is invariably the bottom line!!! Sadly, however, with the exception of one reputed Home, the Catholics cannot lay claim to any such acts of compassion, monetary or otherwise!!! Apparently one or two of the Homes lack sufficient toilet facilities, which is something unheard of in this day and age, but is still happening!!!

 

 



No value for life

Moving on, ‘Man’s inhumanity does not seem to be limited only to Man but to Beast as well’!!! Look at the shocking massacre of that poor leopard, could they not wait till the Wild Life personnel returned??? What was the hurry to get rid of that poor beast??? Are these the tenets of Buddhism that should be practised in a Buddhist country such as ours??? Unfortunately, our country does not levy hard punishment on those responsible for these dastardly acts!!! Why talk about beasts when a contract was given on the life of a Buddhist Monk!!! It seems money is of no concern to these ruthless people who resort to such violence, and the same can be said of the hooligans who accept these contracts!!! Is Human Life that cheap??? IS HUMAN LIFE OF NO VALUE??? We read of so many lives being taken with the least amount of provocation!!! One miserable excuse of a father threw his 3-year-old son into the river because his wife did not give him money to drink!!! We call ourselves Buddhists and HUMANS!!! WHAT KIND OF HUMANITY IS THIS???

 

Dashed Hopes

We, as citizens of this country, voted for GOOD (YAHAPALANA) GOVERNANCE, BUT AS VOTERS WE NEVER GOT WHAT THEY PROMISED AND WE EXPECTED!!!  

It is not going to take long before the next elections when the VOTER IS MOST CERTAINLY NOT GOING TO BE FOOLED BY GOOD GOVERNANCE THIS TIME!!! WE SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO TAKE A CASE AGAINST THEM, BUT WE CANNOT!!! ALL OUR HOPES WERE DASHED!!! HOWEVER, WHEN THE NEXT GOVERNMENT IS VOTED IN, PERHAPS WE CAN FIND A WAY TO BRING ‘GOOD GOVERNANCE’ TO JUSTICE!!!

 

MIG AND BOND 

 

We need to ask just one question TO WHOM DOES UDAYANGA WEERATUNGA REALLY BELONG??? It seems that MR is more powerful than INTERPOL!!! MR says he can bring him back!!! Is he doing a favour for this Government, for himself or for UDAYANGA??? THE OUTCOME IS GOING TO BE VERY INTERESTING INDEED!!! VERY INTERESTING!!! What about ARJUN ALOYSIUS??? Doesn’t he also have someone like UDAYANGA who can come forward to help him??? It seems likely that someone will come forward to help ALOYSIUS TOO, VERY SOON!!! Again we ask, will they come forward or will we perhaps need to have an AUCTION to determine who will come forward for Aloysius!!!

 

 



Desperate, people ready to accept murderers

 

The people of our country are exhausted by politics beguiled and beleaguered by politicians through the ages and are now dreaming of what it would be like to be governed by a Dictator!!! Corrupt politicians have taken us to a place where we no longer believe that we are deserving of honest, right-minded, benevolent leaders like them!!! 

We are EVEN WILLING to accept that they be allowed to pocket 50%, as long as they do something for the country with the balance 50%!!! They may be murderers or have stolen billions from public funds, but they are considered acceptable as opposed to the good governance rogues and hypocrites, who say one thing and do the exact opposite!!!

They have made us believe that we are a nation of uncivilized, undisciplined, lazy, foolish citizens who can only be made productive by a Dictator!!! This has been embedded in our subconscious to consolidate their dominance and positions of power!!! We are not going to let Dictators take control or to diminish our rights as human beings so you better start taking note of the fact that we expect YOU TO DELIVER YOUR PROMISES, EVEN NOW!!!

 

The Colombo Elite

What of the poor? The Colombo society is not affected by fuel increases, tax levies, but the poor man who works so hard for a living to make ends meet, they are burdened by these and have to resort to eating potato, manioc, breadfruit, jak and other staples are grown by them!!! Yahapalana ate everything in one shot with a polkatu handa and spilt it all over themselves but MR and family kept on eating with a spoon, and their lower ranks ate with a teaspoon!!! The poor people are suffering today from the MR backlash, but if this system goes on then everyone will have to eat ala, bathala, manioc even without SALT!!! With whatever spoon you eat, SHIT IS SHIT!!!

The poor man has to stand by and watch all the LUXURY VEHICLES moving around sometimes on roads where people can’t even walk!!! The Mirigama/Enderamulla Highway is supposed to be making headway but a tortoise moves faster!!! In 2020, Yahapalana will have to exhume Thajudeen again and promise to solve Keith Noyahr and ALL the unsolved mysteries to fool the people once again!!!
