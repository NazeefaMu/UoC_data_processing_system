Making hey while the Sun shines


	



 

The head of a state-owned establishment is said to be illegally drawing a hefty monthly pay of Rs.800,000. 

 


However, the high-up is doing hardly any work for the establishment to deserve any pay for that matter, say the employees.


He has failed to update the website of the establishment which had once won high recognition from the British Computer Society for its excellence. 


The high-up has now rented his own website for the use of the establishment for Rs.200,000 a month, but it is being hardly used to serve the purposes of the establishment, they say.
