The Joint Opposition is contemplating to quit the constitution-making process until the government declares elections due at the moment, officials said yesterday.

Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) Leader Prof. G.L. Peiris told the Daily Mirror that the leaders of the Joint Opposition took this decision on Tuesday evening. He said there was no point in participating in the process as long as there was no elections in the country.
