This lady who once held very high office in the country has also been a controversial figure.

 


While travelling past Union Place the other day, she got the driver to stop the vehicle opposite a supermarket. She got down and walked into the supermarket with her security detail at her heels. Thereafter, she made a beeline to the foreign liquor bar. She was inspecting the rare brands of quality liquor when she suddenly noticed that a youth was carefully focusing the video camera of his mobile phone on her. This sent the lady into a flutter and she barked an order to her security men to catch the youth. 


Taking advantage of the seconds taken by the security to swing into action, the youth bolted and disappeared in the milling street crowd.  


By the time, the highly upset lady reached her official residence, video clips showing her at the foreign liquor counter had already appeared on social media websites!
