Cricket politics fever in our country is something that never shows any sign of let up, they say. 

 


Some people whose hearts and minds are glued to cricket politics cannot keep themselves away from this ‘game’ even if they are officially separated from it, they say. 


“For example, there is a certain character hooked on cricket politics currently removed from the scene,” a prominent Diyawanna politico from the South told a group of colleagues at a lobby session. “This person continues to act as if he is still in the saddle.” He proceeded to recall that the strange conduct of this character came up for discussion at a recent informal meeting between the Pohottuwa faction and their hesitant colleagues still in yahapalanaya. 


This person, he said, though no more in the cricket administration had, on the eve of the last SL versus South Africa test in Galle had pressed those in authority to squeeze into the local team several players of his choice and in fact, he had also questioned the wisdom of including in the team some star players whom he did not like.
