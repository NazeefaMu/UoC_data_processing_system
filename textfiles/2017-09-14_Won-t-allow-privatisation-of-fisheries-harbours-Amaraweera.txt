Responding to a statement made by MP Vijitha Herath on Monday (11) with regards to the privatisation of fisheries harbours, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Minister Mahinda Amaraweera yesterday said that none of the fisheries harbours would be privatised or leased out to private firms.

Addressing a media briefing, he said that the JVP MP had been misled about what was contained in the Cabinet paper which was categorically envisaged only to allow both private and government sector investors to launch development projects within the harbour premises.

He further said that Cabinet approval had been sought not to privatise or to lease any of the fisheries harbours but to set the stage for local investors to initiate productive investments which would not harm the livelihoods of fishermen around them.

In addition, he stated that if any foreign investor wished to launch a project here, he or she must go for a merger with local investors as they would not be allowed to launch any project alone. (Sheain Fernandopulle)
