A youth, who had been allegedly assaulted by two policemen, today denied police claims at Mathugama Court that he asked the police not to pursue the case in a police inquiry.

Tharindu Priyankara (16) was beaten by two police officers at Dodangoda, Kalutara on 1st. April for not obeying a police order to stop.

Two police officers attached to the Dodangoda Police Station were suspended after a video clip emerged, showing them beating a motorcyclist mercilessly.

He was beaten up in broad-daylight watched by a crowd of by-standers, one of whom videoed and uploaded the incident on social media that went viral later.

Kalutara ASP Kapila Premadasa had probed the incident and had suspended the two men -Sergeant Chandrajith Kapilasiri (59558) and Constable N. Arunasiri (6108) attached to the Dodangoda Police Station. Later the police withdrew the case stating the victim requested them not to continue the investigation.

However, the Ceylon Motorcyclists' Association and the boy’s parents filed a case against the police in Court.

Attorney-at-Law Nallapperuma appearing for the victim informed that the victim denied he requested not to continue the investigation.

The Matugama Additional Magistrate postponed the case to August 25 as the police failed to produce the victim’s medical certificate. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
