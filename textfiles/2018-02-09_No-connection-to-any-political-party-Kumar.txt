No connection to any political party: Kumar


	

Cricket legend Kumar Sangakkara yesterday refused reports of him backing a certain political party and said that he has no affiliation with any political party.

In a tweet, he said he was disappointing to learn that his comment on the Local Government (LG) elections is being used by unscrupulous elements to say that he supports a certain political party.

“I have no connection to any party. I only hope any elected official will put our country first and not their party,” he said.

Remember at the Local Government Elections on the 10th of February no matter where you live in Sri Lanka “bad officials are elected by good citizens who do not vote. “
