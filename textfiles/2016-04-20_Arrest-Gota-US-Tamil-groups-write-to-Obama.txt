Arrest Gota: US Tamil groups write to Obama


	

In an urgent appeal to President Barrack Obama, two major Tamil groups in the US-Tamils for Obama and American Tamil Forum- had urged the US to arrest former Sri Lankan Defense Secretary Gotabaya Rajapakse who is reported to be currently visiting US, the World News Report reported on Wednesday.

According to United Nations internal review report around 70,000 Tamils were killed in six months during the early part of 2009 and the abuses committed by the Sri Lankan forces amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity.

"US should not miss the opportunity to arrest and prosecute one of the main war criminals in recent times visiting the US. Failure to do so would encourage others to commit abuses amounting to war crimes" said these two organizations.

The UN Human Rights Council, led by the US, last year passed a Sri Lanka resolution to hold a credible investigation to punish those responsible for these killings.

"United States should take the same leadership it took at the UN to initiate investigation for the visiting Sri Lankan war criminal,” said these two organizations (EIN Presswire)
