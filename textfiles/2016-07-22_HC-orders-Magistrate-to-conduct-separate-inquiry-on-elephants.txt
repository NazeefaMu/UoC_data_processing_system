The Colombo High Court today, concluding its deliberations on the revision application filed by the Attorney General against the Colombo Chief Magistrate's decision to release 15 elephants on a bond, directed the Chief Magistrate to conduct a special inquiry into every elephant separately.

High Court Judge Manilal Waidyathilake also ordered that only elephants with valid licenses be released from those 15 elephants with the rest to be handed over to the Wild Life Department.

More than 40 elephants had been taken into the custody of the Department of Wild Life by the CID for being kept without valid licenses. (Shehan Chamika Silva)
