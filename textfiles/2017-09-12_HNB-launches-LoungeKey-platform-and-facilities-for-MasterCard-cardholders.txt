HNB MasterCard World, Corporate and Business cardholders can now escape the bustle of busy airport departure halls using the complimentary LoungeKey platform to gain access to over 800 international airport lounges in over 120 countries across the globe. 


Available from 1st September, complimentary membership to the MasterCard LoungeKey platform is paired with a free mobile phone application that can locate participating airport lounges worldwide.
“HNB remains fully committed to delivering unparalleled service excellence to our customers and our partnership with Mastercard represents another exciting development in this journey. There is tremendous interest from our customers and we are confident that our HNB Master cardholders will respond enthusiastically to the LoungeKey platform offer,” HNB Chief Operating Officer Dilshan Rodrigo stated.


LoungeKey is an airport lounge programme that allows you and your supplementary cardholders entry at participating lounges by showing a valid HNB MasterCard World Credit card, all without the need to carry an additional membership card.


The complimentary membership to this programme will be available to MasterCard World Customers, who will also have the option of making two complimentary lounge visits per year, in addition to paid access for overseas lounges at a low price of US$27 per visit for both cardholders and their guests, where they can enjoy complimentary snacks and refreshments while also gaining access to business facilities, internet, phones, fax machines and conference space.


Complimentary membership will also be provided to HNB’s MasterCard Corporate and MasterCard Business customers.


“At HNB, we take great pride in our ability to create value added products and services and so we are very excited to be able to offer our valued cardholders access to the LoungeKey platform. Internationally, this is one of the simplest most relaxing ways to travel and we look forward to delivering world class experiences to our valued customers moving forward,” Head of Cards at HNB, Roshantha Jayathunge said.
