This Ministerial one was vociferous in the recent past about the corruption rampant in other places.  He is now busy pushing through a shady deal for the sale of heaps of scrap iron lying in the Ministry-owned yards, they say.
It has transpired that the Ministerial one has already reached agreement with an agent from a neighboring country now on a visit here for the release of about 1,000 metric tons of scrap iron for the first shipment. 
This Ministry eternally in the red, has to beg or borrow even to meet the monthly pay bill of its employees and the latter usually keeping a watchful eye on the goings-on in it are closely monitoring every move being  made in pursuit of this deal, they say
