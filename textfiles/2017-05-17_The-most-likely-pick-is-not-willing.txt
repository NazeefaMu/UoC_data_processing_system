The country’s defense secretarial chair is due to fall vacant shortly and Number One in yahapalanaya is considering several nominees preparatory to making his pick to fit the bill.

 


At the top of this list of nominees is a head of a leading commercial bank in the country who once served as a secretary to the country’s first lady Prime Minister.


Next on the list is a doctor in the AG’s department and the third on the list is an additional secretary at the main secretariat who functioned as the GA Puttalam sometime ago. 


Meanwhile, the head of the bank at the top of the nominees’ list has indicated his willingness to continue in the current office and this development is likely to prolong the selection process, they say.
