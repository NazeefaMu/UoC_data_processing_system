Novel way of offering the ‘liquor bribe’


	



 

A local poll candidate in the Kandy district has distributed among his constituents a chit to be used as a token to buy a specific quantity of liquor from a wine shop in the locality. 

 


Villagers keen on enjoying a free drink in the evening are seen queuing up at the candidate’s residence to receive the ‘bar tokens’ these days, they say.


The candidate’s active supporters who would linger about his residence for hours on end at previous polls would now disappear from the scene as soon as they receive their liquor token, they say.
