Why no autopsy held on Ven. Sobitha Thera?


	

Colombo Chief Magistrate Gihan Pilapitiya yesterday ordered National Hospital Director Dr. Anil Jasinghe to conduct a full inquiry comprising a group of eminent medical experts on the failure to conduct a proper autopsy into the death of late Ven. Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera and to submit a comprehensive report to court soon.

The Chief Magistrate ordered this when the CID requested the Court to order the National Hospital director to conduct a thorough inquiry into the failure to conduct a proper autopsy into the death of late Ven. Thera in order to compare the investigation reports and drugs used by the Thera while he was at the National Hospital in Colombo and the death certificate and drugs used while the Thera was being treated at the Mt. Elizabeth Hospital in Singapore.

The CID yesterday filed a facts report and informed the Magistrate about the investigation following a complaint lodged by Ven. Uduwe Dhammaloka Thera of the Sri Alen Mathiniyaramaya, Narahenpita, alleging the death was suspicious.

The magistrate also directed the CID to obtain all relevant documents of the patient, Ven. Sobhitha Thera from National Hospital Dr. Nevil Fernando, the Central Private Hospital and also from the Mt. Elizebeth Hospital in Singapore, where the Thera received treatment. (Shehan Chamika)
