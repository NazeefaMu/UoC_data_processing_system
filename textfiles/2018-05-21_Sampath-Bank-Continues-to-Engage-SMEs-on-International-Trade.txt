“The Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) sector has always been one of the key drivers of economic growth in the country. Hence, right from our inception, we at Sampath Bank have been working closely with entrepreneurs from the sector, serving as their trusted financial partner, confidant and advisor,” said Mrs. Shashi Kandambi Jassim, Senior Deputy General Manager - Corporate Banking, Sampath Bank PLC. “A reflection of our steadfast commitment to supporting them, the “Obe Diyunuwata Ape Maga Penweema” seminars are yet another means by which we seek to add value to this sector. Lending our support to the country’s drive to achieve a target of $20 billion in exports revenue by 2020, we are delighted to engage with ever more enterprising Sri Lankans through this forum.” 



The Bank has conducted “Obe Diyunuwata Ape Maga Penweema” seminars in Colombo, Galle, Kandy and Negombo and plans to hold such forums in key business centers around the island in 2018.
