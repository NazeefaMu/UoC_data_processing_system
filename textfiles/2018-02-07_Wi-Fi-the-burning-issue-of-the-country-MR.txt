Wi-Fi, the burning issue of the country: MR


	

Former president and MP Mahinda Rajapaksa yesterday ridiculed Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe’s renewed pledge that the country would be enabled with free public Wi-Fi by the year end, by saying that having free public Wi-Fi has become the burning issue of the country today.

Mr. Rajapaksa sarcastically said villagers are asking for Wi-Fi instead of fertilizer for their farms.

“Wi-Fi is one of the most necessary item of the people today. The most burning issue of the country today, to our people in the village, is not fertilizer or other necessities but Wi-Fi. People are asking for Wi-Fi everywhere. Therefore, the Premier has to provide it. He has said Wi-Fi will help the youth when dating. One cannot even do that in an empty stomach,” he told journalist at the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) Office yesterday.

When asked as to why he didn’t take part in the debate on the bond commission’s report and the PRECIFAC report, Mr. Rajapaksa said he would attend the debate on its last day.

“I was about to go, but a decision was taken by our party leaders to release me because I have to attend a meeting in Kantale. First we thought the debate will be concluded within a day. Had it been for one day, I would have spoken. Since the debate will be held for three days, I decided to speak on the last day,” he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
