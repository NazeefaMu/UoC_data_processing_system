It would be convenient for people if the Government announced September 5 as a public holiday in order to reduce the congestion that could be caused by the protest campaign organised by the Joint Opposition (JO), the Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) said.

The Janabalaya Kolambata, Anti-Government protest campaign organised by the Joint Opposition (JO) is scheduled to be held on September 5 in Colombo.

Addressing a news briefing, PHU leader Udaya Gammanpila said the employees working in Colombo would be highly inconvenienced owing to this massive protest.

“We don’t like to see people getting inconvenienced because of this protest, which is done against the inefficiencies of the Government,

“If the Government would not make the day a holiday, we request the heads of the companies in Colombo to give their employees a holiday on that particular day,” Gammanpila said. (Sheain Fernandopulle)
