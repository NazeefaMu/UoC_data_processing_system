In the early days it was played every year, once in 2006 to 2009 the game was not held, again it was revived after a lapse of four years 2010.
This time the game was played at the Peradeniya University grounds. The forecast was gloomy with just a few glimpses of sun predicted during the day.
The biggest mistake made by the medical side was they took strike on the wet wicket first. Any way both the Doctors and Lawyers were on the field to give of the best. The Lawyers team led by Pradeep Wijeratne combined to bowl out the Doctors for 80 runs in just 27.2 over's. Captain of the side Raskika Manatunge batted well to score 20 runs and Doctors folded meekly due mainly to excellent bowling by Supun Rajapakse (4 for 12) , Jeewan Basnayake (4 for 17) and Ranjan Ranatunge (2 for 8). It was very cautious start by the Lawyers, former skipper Roshan de Rafayel batting in good form added 40 runs off the first few over's. Jeewan Basnayake made a quick unbeaten 15 Charuka Kanakahewa and Suenth Chandraratne bowled best to pocket two wickets each for 26 runs.
Kandy Doctors XI: 80 all-out in 27.2 overs (Rasika Manatunga 20, Jeevan Samarasekara 14 not out, Supun Rajapakse 4 for 12, Ranjan Ranatunge 2 for 8, Jeewan Basnayake 4 for 17)
Kandy Lawyers XI: 81 for 4 wickets in 23.3 over's (Roshan Rafayel 40, Jeevan Basnayake 15 not out, Charuka Kanmakwhewa 2 for 26, Suneth Chandraratne 2 for 26)
