The Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) Central Committee met at the party headquarters today and decided to amend the party constitution and finalise appointments of new SLFP office bearers at the convention tomorrow (14).
SLFP General Secretary Anura Priyadharshana Yapa said the party’s executive council which is also to be attended by former Presidents Chandrika Bandaranaike and Mahinda Rajapaksa will take the final decision on these matters.
“We have sent invitations to all council members asking them to attend Saturday’s meeting. We didn’t discuss any matters connected to the prime ministerial candidate for the upcoming general elections,” Mr. Yapa told journalists at the party headquarters in Colombo.    
When asked about the views of the party with regard to some United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) members proposing former President Rajapaksa as the UPFA’s prime ministerial candidate, he said the SLFP had not received any invitation from any party for a discussion on such a topic.   
    
“SLFP is the main constituent of the UPFA but we haven’t had discussions on the prime ministerial candidate. Our priorities at this point are party reforms. We have ample time to make decisions on the election,” he said.  (Lahiru Pothmulla and Sanath Desmond)
