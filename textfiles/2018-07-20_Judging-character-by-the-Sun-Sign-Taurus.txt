Natal Solar month and the Sun Sign – Part 2

Taurus people are usually calm and quiet and are slow to anger.  They would not get easily exited.  They would not get easily provoked either.  But if they get provoked, their anger would know no bounds. 

Good lovers and haters


Taurus people are tireless and hard working.  They would not begin a job of work with a flourish or a great show of enthusiasm. But once they embarked on a task, they would carry it out with commitment and perseverance.  Their emotions are like fire and brimstone inside a volcano, and their feelings be it love, hatred or vindictiveness are intense and long lasting.  They would continue to harbour a grudge even after taking revenge.
