JVP to prod govt. to act against the corrupt

The Police Financial Crimes Division which investigated 198 financial frauds since the Hedging transaction to date has completed investigations into 30 of them and sent the reports to the Attorney General's Department but the department had failed to take any action on them so far, JVP General Secretary Tylvin Silva said.
Addressing a press conference at the JVP Headquarters yesterday, Silva alleged that the government was uttering falsehoods to deceive the masses without taking any action against the people involved in financial crimes.
He said although Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera advised people not to get upset about the lack of action against corrupt individuals adding that they would soon be astounded when such action was taken by the government, nothing had happened so far in this connection.
Silva said the arresting of corrupt individuals were being needlessly delayed by adducing political reasons.
"When the 2016 Budget was introduced the government willfully postponed action against wrong doers by starting a public debate on the budget. Now such action had been again delayed by starting a dialogue on a new constitution. If this tactic continued, the corrupt individuals and other wrong doers would never be hauled before court," he said.
Silva said the 100 days programme of the government which followed the 2015 Presidential Election, also did nothing about fraud and corruption.
"Only Basil Rajapaksa was arrested and subsequently released. At that time, the IGP issued an order saying no arrests should be made without the recommendations of the Attorney General. This denied the Police the power to arrest culprits after completing investigations. The Attorney General was the intervening agent of the government," he said.
"Even though Police completed investigations, the action due on the part of the government had not been taken.
Now action against corruption had completely stalled after the formation of a coalition government. Although an year had passed after defeating the corrupt the Rajapaksa regime, no one responsible for murders and frauds had been arrested or indicted before court," Silva said.
He said if the government failed to take any action in this regard by unnecessarily killing time, the JVP would launch a public protest campaign within the next few days to prod the government towards taking action against fraudulent and corrupt persons.
