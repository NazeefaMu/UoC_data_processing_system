Ceylinco Life urges Sri Lankans to put ‘Children First, Education Next’


	

Ceylinco Life’s continuing emphasis on the importance of families spending quality time together has found new expression in the latest communication campaign launched by Sri Lanka’s life insurance market leader.


Building up to another mega family fun event conceptualised, organised and funded by the company, the two-month long campaign seeks to create wider awareness of the harmful effects of parents and children being obsessed with education to the extent where the well-being of the children becomes secondary.


Themed ‘Children First, Education Next’, the awareness campaign is to be carried out in print, electronic, social and digital media throughout February and March and will underscore the importance of giving children the time, space and freedom to think freely, spend time with family and to enjoy their precious childhood.


Going beyond mere messaging, Ceylinco Life has announced it will back the campaign up with a signature event for 300 families in Colombo in August to demonstrate the value of wholesome family fun.


“As a company that is engaged in a relationship for life with close to a million families, Ceylinco Life has an insight into society’s pressing issues,” the company’s Managing Director R. Renganathan explained. 


“One issue that is of increasing concern is the intense pressure on children to perform at examinations. This is depriving them of the chance to be children and to spend time with their parents and siblings. The ‘Children First, Education Next’ campaign is designed to address this issue.”
In order to select families for the ‘Mega Family Fun Day’ in Colombo in August, Ceylinco Life will conduct a draw for all new policyholders who purchase life insurance between February 1 and April 30, 2018, the company said.


The event will comprise of magic shows, rides and slides, bouncers, a merry-go-round, trampolines, face painting, games and many other fun activities for the entire family.


One of the highlights of the event will be a draw at which one participating family will win a visit to Universal Studios Singapore courtesy of Ceylinco Life and four other families will win weekend packages to a star-class hotel in Sri Lanka.
