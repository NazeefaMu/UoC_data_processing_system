	The National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB) has taken steps to pay 20 per cent of the employees’ basic monthly salary from today as an allowance until the Cabinet approves a salary increase.
	NWSDB Director Mahilal de Silva said the allowance payable for the current month was credited to the employees’ bank accounts and noted that the Salary Anomalies Adjustment Commission recommendations, which were approved by the Cabinet and the NWSDB Board of Directors, were submitted to the Treasury.
	He pointed out that the salary increments at government institutions should be carried out through a standard procedure
	“I believe that the NWSDB trade unions have been informed on the steps taken by the administration in this regard,” Mr. de Silva said.
	He said despite the efforts of the Board of Directors to meet the demands made by the trade unions, some individuals with personal agendas were attempting to disrupt the smooth functioning of the NWSDB.
	“We will not hesitate to take stern action against them.  The proposed trade union action by a group of employees in Kandy today is not justified in view of the steps taken by the administration to grant adequate relief to the employees,” he said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)
