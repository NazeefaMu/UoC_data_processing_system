(Daily Mail, London), 5 January 2017-Girls as young as six are being forced to marry men old enough to be their grandfather and into a life of ‘sexual slavery’ beatings, pregnancies and death during childbirth, a charity is warning.  


More than 12,000 girls under 15 will become child brides every day of 2017 around the world – or one every seven seconds.  


The disturbing figures are revealed in exhaustive research and analysis carried out by the UK-based charity ‘Save the Children’, who predict 15 million schoolgirls of 15 or younger will marry in 2017. UK aid workers highlight a shocking catalogue of cases where young married girls face domestic violence, abuse and rape.   


In one, a six year-old girl is reported to have been ‘sold’ into marriage with a man more than 40 years older in exchange for a goat in Afghanistan
