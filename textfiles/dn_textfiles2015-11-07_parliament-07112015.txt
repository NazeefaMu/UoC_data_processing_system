Former govt agreed to grant one phase to China Metallic Corp - PM
Phase I of the Kandurata Expressway has to be constructed under an unsolicited system, as the previous government had entered into an agreement to grant one phase of the Construction under the same system, said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday.
He also stated that the previous government had agreed to grant one phase from Potuhera to Rambukkana to the China Metallic Corporation and the present government has only changed which phase should be granted to construct under an unsolicited system.
"We could not help, except construct it under an unsolicited system as they told us they would sue us pleading for compensation, if we did not give one phase under the unsolicited system," the Premier said.
"Tell us as to why one phase was given under the unsolicited system? Due to this reason this government has had to shoulder an added burden yesterday in response to a question raised by Opposition member Dullas Allahapperuma. The Prime Minister further stated that this government would have to pay compensation if it acted against the unsolicited system, while politicians of the previous government received commissions.
"The Premier made these observations in Parliament yesterday, in response to a question raised by Opposition member Dallas Alahapperuma for oral answers.
"Did this government grant construction of the first phase of the Kandurata Expressway under the unsolicited system," Alahapperuma questioned.
"But the then government questioned and criticised vehemently the grant of construction of the Express ways under the unsolicited system."
Premier Wickremesinghe further stated that the previous government wanted to construct a middle part of the Kandurata Expressway. "They did not need to commence the construction from Kandy or Kadawatha. They wanted to construct the Potuhera - Rambukkana phase," the Premier said," adding that it was for more commissions.
The Opposition member stated that the first phase of the Kandurata Expressway had not been granted to any other, but five local constructors had agreed to construct it.
At this stage the Prime Minister stated that the government had to invest money on the construction, adding that those 5 constructors had been selected on a friendly basis.
"If the Opposition says five local contractors agreed to construct it, reveal their names, the Premier challenged the opposition. The World Bank is ready to grant a loan for the construction of the phase which is to be constructed by local constructors. We will open it for all constructors in the country to apply in a transparent way, not like during the previous regime."
Opposition member Alahapperuma had directed the question to the Higher Education and Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella. When Alahapperuma questioned as to what was the cost of 1Km on the construction of the Expressway from Kadawatha to Mirigama, Minister Kiriella said it was Rs. 4.48 billion.
"The proposed construction cost of 1 Km for the 6 lane Expressway was Rs. 4.48 billion under the previous regime. Then the opposition asked was it constructed of Gold," Alahapperuma said. "Now the same cost is proposed for the 4 lane expressway. The people would question if the same expressway was reconstructed of gold and platinum."
At this stage, Minister Kiriella stated that Premier Wickremesinghe in 2003, brought an investor from Malaysia to construct the Expressway to Kandy which is the second capital of the country at a cost of US$ 60 billion.
But the new government in 2005 did not implement it, Minister Kiriella said. If the previous government had the need, they would have done it. But now they shed crocodile tears for the people in Kandy.
The minister further stated the Mahinda Rajapaksa government did not construct the Kandy Expressway, as their government lost Kandy by 75,000 votes.
He said instead, the previous government constructed an Expressway where there were not many vehicles.
 
Higher Education State Minister to look into SE University problems
Leader of the House and Highways and Higher Education Minister Lakshman Kiriella yesterday in Parliament, said that a Ministerial team led by the Higher Education State Minister would make an inspection tour of the South Eastern University to look into its problems.
He was responding to a question raised by Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake, under Standing Order 23 (2). MP Dissanayake pointed out that about 300 students from the Engineering Faculty of the South Eastern University faced many difficulties due to lack of physical and human resources.
He said the Engineering Faculty of this University was established in 2012, without a proper feasibility study as a quick remedy for the Z-Score issue of the A-L exam in 2011. "Now three batches of students have been recruited to this Faculty, but the students do not have sufficient lecturers, library and other facilities to study. This is an injustice to them," he noted.
Minister Kiriella said he was aware of the problem which resulted due an experiment conducted by the former Government. "A group of students of this faculty met him on October 20 to discuss their problems. After which, it was decided to send a team led by the Higher Education State Minister to make an inspection tour and come up with recommendations to solve the existing problems. Even though we are ready to grant an allowance of Rs 100,000 for lecturers who are willing to go to this university, no lecturer is willing to do so," he stated.
 
'CEB spent additional Rs. 12,750 million on fuel'
The Ceylon Electricity Board has had to spend an additional amount of Rs. 12,750 million on fuel(oil) on electricity generation as the contracted supplier failed to supply 300,000 tonnes of coal for the Puttalam Power Plant last year, said Power and Renewable Energy Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya.
The minister made this observation yesterday in a ministerial statement made in Parliament.
He stated that five tenders have been called since 2009 to register suppliers to the Puttalam power plant. "However, none of those tenders could be granted as the bidders could not comply to the standards outlined by the Cabinet Procurement Committee," the minister said. "Out of the five, one had been cancelled before the opening of tenders. The rest had been rejected by the Cabinet of Ministers, he said."
The minster stated that due these reasons, coal had been purchased from a single supplier without adhering to proper tender procedures during the past five years. He said the coal purchasing process of the Puttalam power plant was criticized in media and there were several court cases pertaining to it.
The minister also said some groups have complained to the Financial Crimes Investigations Division (FCID) and the Special Investigation Commission appointed by the President.
He said further that the Puttalam power plant comprised three phases with a capacity of 900 MW generation. "It has three sub plants which could produce around 55 percent of the country's total power requirement." "The minister said three plants required 2.25 million metric tons of coal an year for its operation. That haul of coal costs US$ 150 million."
The minister added that as the current tender procedure for the purchase of coal was so simple and transparent, purchasing would not be a challenge in the future.
 
Milco money misused during previous Presidential election
Rs 15 -20 million of Milco Company's money has been misused during the previous Presidential Election, Rural Economic Affairs Minister P Harrison said in Parliament yesterday.
He said the above sum of money had been misused to provide milk packets and yogurt to those who attended public meetings at Temple Trees prior to the Presidential Election.
"The money was spent on 'dansals' at Temple Trees. We are presently taking necessary steps to get that money back from those who were responsible for it. We will take severe action against those officials who had given approval for such spending," he noted.
The minister further said the milk powder production in the country would be doubled by March next year, and it would be trebled by year 2017.
The minister was responding to a question raised by UNP MP Buddhika Pathirana.
