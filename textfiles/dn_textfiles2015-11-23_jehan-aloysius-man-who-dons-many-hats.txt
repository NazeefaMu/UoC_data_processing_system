Jehan Aloysius A man who dons many hats

He has written and acted in countless plays in and outside Colombo, and hasn’t just stuck to that – he also sometimes designs costumes and sets, lectures at institutes and lends his skills as a voicing artist. His drama company CentreStage Productions is constantly churning out fresh new feasts for theater enthusiasts, like last week’s Pyramus & Thisby, a vibrant, creative Sri Lankan take on scenes from the Shakespearean classic A Midsummer Night’s Dream.
The playwright, twice shortlisted for the Graetian Award, is currently getting his team ready to represent Sri Lanka at the esteemed Bharat Rang Mahotsav in India, the third largest theater festival in the world. We managed to catch a break with him in the midst of his busy schedule, to talk about his journey as a dramatist and his contributions to Sri Lankan art and culture.
How did your love of theater first begin?
It began in school at St Joseph’s College, with me participating in Shakespeare drama competitions and at the British Council, in the early ‘90s. Directors like Scott Richards and Frank Barry were brought down at the time, which introduced me to the Western paradigm of directing and performing. It was the magic of escaping into other worlds that attracted me to theater. I was quite fat and a loner when I was young – so when I was alone I enjoyed creating scenarios and play-acting.
Has it been difficult climbing to the top of the English drama scene in Colombo?
I don’t know if I’ve still got to the top – the moment you think you have, then you stop moving forward. I’m still on the journey and will be to my last breath. Theater does not pay at all. So I’ve had to develop new skills, and expand them for an evolving audience – I don’t just act and direct, but also have had to design costumes, compose and mix music, and so on. I’ve had to wear many hats. It hasn’t been an easy journey, and I’ve had to turn myself into a diverse, creative person. I also expect this expansion of skills in my actors. We’ve also done things like forum theater, bilingual theater - and social theater for disabled people as well, because inclusivity is important. It’s been a challenge, turning negatives into positives. I believe drama comes out of conflict, between your objectives and the obstacles you face when you go after them.
What has been the most memorable production of your career?
I think ‘Rag’ was my most memorable one. It’s about university ragging, based on my experiences at the University of Colombo. I worked on it for 14 years, and the music was done by my good friend Avanti Perera. It was published on BBC and covered by Katmandu News and so on – it’s the one closest to my heart. But to some – our first performance of Pyramus and Thisby in 2006 was unforgettable! It was outdoors, I had chicken gunya, my cast had dengue, and we still went ahead and performed – in the rain!
What are the challenges you face as an actor in Sri Lanka?
There is a lack of training for actors here. And actors are usually chosen based on what they’ve already done, rather than their ability to develop. We need to develop young talent. Training is not available to most actors today. They need to learn to diversify their skills. Also, theater and cinema do not pay. Even Sinhala language drama does not pay on its own – you need to do other things to pay the bills. English language productions here are amateur, not professional. You have to do it for the love of it, not for the money. You have to have a passion to please your audience.
Pyramus and Thisby has been performed in Colombo since 2006, and it’s a big hit with theater audiences. What about it makes it stand out?
Pyramus and Thisby borrows two sub-plots from Shakespeare’s play. I set the scenes in Sri Lanka, and it is a celebration of Sri Lankan theater and folk dance. You’ll see folk theater traditions, some thovil, kolam and fusion dance – and this is combined with the beauty of Shakespeare’s verse. The high hilarity of the kolam dance goes with the bawdiness of some of Shakespeare’s comic characters. There is a variety of talent in the production, and it’s one play that my cast is always eager to perform again. It is one of my most studied plays – so many students are doing dissertations on it now. It doesn’t stick to one language – there is the Sinhala language, the faery language, and then there’s also dance. The audience is an absolute part of it – there is no fourth wall – so they are made to interact, interpret and interpret, and finally are integrated into the production.
What is next for you in, say, 10 years?
It will be the 20th anniversary of Pyramus and Thisby in ten years! I plan on doing a new version of ‘Rag’. And also I’d like to develop repertory theater, where we work from a repertoire of work. There will be new plays coming up, like our version of Frankenstein, and a new adaptation of Romeo and Juliet. Every bit of music and costume we have is created specifically for the show it’s in. I feel this approach is more valuable than duplicating performances. This is how Sri Lankan literature and Sri Lankan identities are made. It’s more about the impact of the production, not how big the production is.
Which do you love best – acting, playwrighting or directing?
I really can’t choose. I love being a dramatist. I’m my own boss, and I’m harder on myself than anyone else. I wouldn’t give it up for anything.
Who are some of the artistes in theater that you most admire?
In Sinhala drama I truly admire Dharmasiri Bandaranaike and Jith Pieiris – the first person who believed in me. These two had the most impact in my life, while Scott Richards’ influence when I was young was pivotal.
What do you feel the future of Sri Lankan drama will look like?
We need to cut people away from their cable TVs, their Playstations and mobile phones. It’s a problem everywhere, all over the world, where people can’t stay away from these things. In theater we want to give you a real experience, as opposed to a virtual one. Also theater in Colombo today is not treated as the main event – it’s either after coffee or before dinner. Theater has to adapt, to find new ways to survive. I can’t really predict the future, because everything is always in flux.
What signature advice would you give actors studying under you?
Sounds cliché, but I would say follow your dreams, make it your passion. Find ways to keep that passion in your job and your life. I believe everyone has to have that element of art in them – whether painting or acting or anything, it gives you an escape, a release, which is important.
