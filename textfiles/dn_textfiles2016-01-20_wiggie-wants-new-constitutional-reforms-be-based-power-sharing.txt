Wiggie wants new constitutional reforms to be based on power sharing

Northern Province Chief Minister C. V. Wigneswaran called for new constitutional reforms to be based on power sharing through shared sovereignty while stressing that the Northern and Eastern Provinces should be merged to form a single Tamil-speaking province.
The Tamil National Alliance (TNA) considers the principles and constitutional provisions establishing "sharing of the powers of governance through a shared sovereignty amongst the peoples who inhabit this island" to be paramount to the resolution of the national question, Wigneswaran said addressing a seminar on constitution making in multi-ethnic societies held in Jaffna.
"And the devolution of power on the basis of shared sovereignty shall necessarily be over land, law and order, socio-economic development including health and education, resources and fiscal powers," he said.
The Chief Minister also stressed that the Tamil speaking people of Sri Lanka has the right to self determination.
