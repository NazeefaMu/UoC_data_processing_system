Owner of the Horana Rubber Factory, where five workers were killed after being exposed to ammonia gas, surrendered to the Horana Magistrate Court today.  

He was remanded until May 11 by the Horana Magistrate.

Some twenty employees were also admitted to the Horana Base Hospital after they were exposed to the gas on April 19.

The Central Environmental Authority (CEA) temporarily revoked the license of the factory soon after, stating that proper procedures had not been followed in handling chemicals.  

Manager of the Factory and the senior laboratory controller were also remanded in connection with the incident earlier this week. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
