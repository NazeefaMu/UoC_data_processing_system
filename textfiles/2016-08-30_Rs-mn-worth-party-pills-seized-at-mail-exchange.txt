The Customs officials at the Central Mail Exchange (CME) today seized a parcel containing 1000 recreation tablets worth Rs.5 million, which were imported from the Netherlands, Deputy Superintendent of Customs Lal Weerakoon said.

“A parcel of 1000 tablets containing methamphetamine as active ingredient was seized for the first time in the history of the Sri Lanka Customs,” he said.

“One 24-year-old person from Grandpass in Colombo was arrested, while he was trying to clear the parcel arrived from the Netherland to another person’s name.

“He arrived at the Central Mail Exchange with a Power of Attorney letter,” Mr. Weerakoon said.

“By comparing the Power of Attorney details with the parcel details, we requested him to open the parcel in front of them,” he said.

“After opening the parcel it was found that some kind of tablets shaped as an owl which was unusual to Sri Lanka. According to the practical training given to us we finally recognized those tablets were used in nightclubs.

“Methamphetamine is drug formula that has an ability to increase energy. It has been reported to lift mood and increase sexual desire to such an extent that users are able to engage in sexual activity continually for several days,” he said.

Each tablet had a market value of Rs. 5,000, he said.

“Later we informed the Customs Narcotic Unit to conduct investigation and they found that the tablets contained methamphetamine as active ingredient.
