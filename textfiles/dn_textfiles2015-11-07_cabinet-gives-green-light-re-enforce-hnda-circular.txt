Cabinet gives green light to re-enforce HNDA circular

The Cabinet of Ministers yesterday approved a proposal by University Education and Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella to grant recognition equivalent to the B.Com degree qualification to the Higher National Diploma in Accountancy (HNDA) qualification as per circular no 46/90.
Addressing the weekly post-Cabinet press briefing, accompanied by Media Minister and co-spokesman Gayantha Karunathilake, Cabinet spokesman and Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senarathna commenting on the police attack on the HNDA students recently, said the circular issued in 1990 had awarded a degree status to the HNDA qualification.
"But, the previous government abolished it. After the new government came to power, the Education Ministry informed the Public Administration and Management Ministry to re-enforce the circular of the HNDA as an alternative qualification to the B.Com degree," he said.
"Since only a few students follow the HNDA course, it is apparent that students participating in the demonstration were not HNDA students. Most were from the same organisation that regularly conducts this type of demonstrations to disrupt the education of students," Dr. Senaratne said.
"The demonstration was conducted on the compulsion of some parties even though we promised to restore the qualification to its former status," he said.
Minister Karunathilake said the Opposition was now trying to say that the Police acted on the government's instructions.
"Police have acknowledged that they did it on their own and not on the instructions of the government. The police used minimum force as the students disrupted peace and obstructed the police personnel from maintaining law and order. We saw how the previous government behaved during the Rathupaswala and Katunayake shooting incidents. Although the former government promised to give a report on these incidents within two weeks, no such report has been released so far," he said.
"Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has already appointed a special committee headed by Dr. B.M.S. Batagoda to probe the attack. We will take steps to release the Committee report as soon as it is made available," the minister said.
