Hunger strike prisoners give up fast

The LTTE suspects held in prisons, who were on a hunger strike demanding their release, gave up their fast last morning.
Commissioner General of Prisons Rohana Pushpakumara said the suspects informed him about their decision to give up the fast on November 16 night adding that they were agreeable to the rehabilitation process proposed by the government. After considering the health condition of the suspects, the prison officers offered them gruel made with sago.
Meanwhile, the government is taking steps to direct LTTE suspects held in prisons to a rehabilitation process and the Prisons and the Attorney General's Department and several other institutions are in the process of selecting suspects qualified for rehabilitation after serving a long time in remand without any legal action.
Pushpakumara said the first batch of suspects to be rehabilitated will be ready in another fortnight.
Earlier, 99 suspects informed the commissioner in writing about their intention to undergo rehabilitation.
A batch of 153 suspects participated in a hunger strike demanding their release and 24 of them were released by courts recently.Meanwhile, the Office of the Opposition Leader R Sampanthan reported the strike action has been temporarily called off until December 15.
Ex-LTTE cadres detained at the Magazine Prison in Colombo and several other prisons launched a hunger strike on October 12 demanding their release.
