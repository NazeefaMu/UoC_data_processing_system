Stunning images have been captured of a whale frolicking in Sydney Harbour at sunset.

The pictures were taken on Monday by award-winning Sydney-based photographer Matt Kemp who runs whale migration photo safaris with Manly Ocean Adventures.

They show the humpback whale at full breach with Sydney's city skyline in the background.

One even shows the whale with its tail out of the water underneath a beautiful rainbow which appeared over Sydney on Monday afternoon. (Daily Mail)
