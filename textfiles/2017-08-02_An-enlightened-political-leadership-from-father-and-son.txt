The gabby purohita who played a lead role in ushering in yahapalanaya after burning bridges behind the former strongman, has now embarked on a new mega plan to ‘blaze the path for a new political journey’, they say.

 


Talks are being held hush-hush behind the scene these days to finalize the preliminaries of the plan themed: “An enlightened political leadership for the country’.


Meanwhile, some political sources say that this plan is nothing but a roadmap designed for the purohita and his son to attain the peak of country’s political power pyramid.


The purohita and his son who have claimed their ability to give leadership to a powerful people’s movement had reportedly held their latest round of talks with a group of loyalists at a venue close to the Timbirigasyaya filling station. 


Even those in the highest echelons in yahapalanaya have already received intelligence all about the purohita’s ambitious plan and events to play out manifesting their reaction are only a matter of time, they say.
