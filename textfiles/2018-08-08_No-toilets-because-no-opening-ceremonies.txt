No toilets because no opening ceremonies!


	



 

Number One in yahapalanaya recently visited several schools during an official tour in the central province. 

 


Whenever, Number One visits a school, he would inquire from teachers, parents and children about the shortcomings that affect them. 


By the way, Number One says that the most common complaint made to him during his visits to schools is that they are short of adequate toilet facilities. 


During his recent visit to schools too, teachers, parents as well as children complained to him about the lack of proper toilet facilities. 


Number One while speaking to a school Principal during his recent visit, expressed his surprise over the unavailability of toilet facilities at schools when adequate funds had already been released for this purpose.  The Principal then explained the reason why the political authorities at the periphery do not pay attention to the construction of toilets at schools. “I’ll explain the real reason, Sir,” said the Principal. “Politicians are glad to open school labs, school buildings etc. because they would get a chance to unveil a commemorative plaque with their names inscribed on it and make a big speech.

But when a toilet is constructed, there would be no such ceremony where they could cut a figure among the people.  That is why they don’t take any interest in constructing toilet facilities at schools.  They are not interested in providing desks and chairs for children either for the same reason!”
