She breathes fire at him for spurning a fortune!


	



 

A Diyawanna politico who had turned down a big money offer running into several millions, is said to be facing the wrath of his better half whose unceasing haranguing is making his life miserable these days, they say.

 


She would blackguard her husband all the time saying, “This man must be raving mad to have refused such a windfall.  The fool had not realized that several generations of ours could live in comfort with that big money!”


The politico would try to justify his refusal to accept the money saying that he could not go against the wish of his voters.


But the wife would retort: “Kehelmal chandadayakayo! You turned your back on a fortune!”
