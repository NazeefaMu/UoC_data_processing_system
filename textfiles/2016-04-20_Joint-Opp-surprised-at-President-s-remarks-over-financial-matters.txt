The joint opposition today said that it was surprised by President Maithripala Sirisena’s remarks that future decisions related to financial matters should only be taken after consulting him.  

The President had informed the Cabinet that decisions related to the Central Bank and other financial matters should only be taken through a committee comprising him, the Prime Minister and the Finance Minister.

“The President of the country should always be consulted when taking financial decisions and it is the normal practice. President’s remarks validate that previous decisions relating to the finance sector, which had led to current financial crisis, had been taken without consulting him,” MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara told a news conference.  (Lahiru Pothmulla)
