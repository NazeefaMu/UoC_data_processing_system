He is braced to go home on a different issue


	


A Green yahapalanaya purohita had to go home recently for the sin of holding a brief for the wrong ‘client’.
Meanwhile, a Blue party purohita also has reportedly said that he too feels like going home.  This purohita from day one of his term under yahapalanaya has been embroiled in disputes with trade unions.
He antagonized all trade unions other than those affiliated to his party soon after assuming duties under Yahapalanaya-Two by openly declaring that he joined the government with the intention of serving “only our people, not others”. 
At a function held recently in the Badulla area, this purohita had vowed that he would either ‘tame’ the trade unions turning against him or sit with the opposition after giving due notice to the Compassionate One.
