The Higher Education and Highways Ministry yesterday justified Minister Lakshman Kiriella’s letter to the Kelaniya University requesting to appoint an individual as a Temporary Lecturer.

A media statement signed by the Minister's Media Coordinator Rajitha Samarasuriya, said, "The Minister had only exercised the power vested in him under the University Act and had only asked to consider the qualifications of the said individual.”

“The university has the authority to reject the minister’s request at any time if they found the required qualifications insufficient .”

The statement said the minister had never exercised his powers in order to function the universities independently and “some individuals have forgotten about his powers under the University Act.”

The statement also charged that the Yahapalana government never removed some lecturers, who openly criticized President Maithripala Sirisena during the last Presidential election, but “they are just trying to gain political mileage by leaking out letters that are sent to the Universities,” the statement added.
