While welcoming the Government’s decision to resume work on the Colombo Port City Project, the Chinese construction company on Tuesday said that it would take prompt measures to ensure that the project would be completed within the expected timeframe.

In a statement, CHEC Port City Colombo (Pvt) Ltd., the project company appreciated the efforts of the Government in working towards a mutually beneficial solution.

However, it said the one-year suspension of the project had resulted in significant losses to both the project company and the Government of Sri Lanka (GoSL).

“This is a result of the huge financial and resources commitment that is required for a project of this scale,” it said.

During the one-year suspension of the project, the company said it had cooperated with the government by consulting various authorities and complied with their requests.

“Sri Lankan Government also conducted the Supplementary Environmental Impact Assessment (SEIA) which was done to understand and fully assess the project’s impact and mitigation measures in developing a comprehensive plan to maximise the benefits to the country,” it said.

The company reiterated that it has been and will always continue to be compliant with all existing laws and regulations of the country.

“We look forward to contributing positively towards Sri Lanka’s economy and to the government’s efforts in improving the livelihood of all Sri Lankans,’ it said.
