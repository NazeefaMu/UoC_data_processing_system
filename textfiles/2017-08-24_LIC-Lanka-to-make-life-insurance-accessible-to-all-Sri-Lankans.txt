This is supported by the security of a trusted and reliable insurance organisation which has already made a significant impression in the local industry.


At the core of the new communications strategy is thesimple, yet heart warming ‘Ant Campaign’ which draws an unpretentious comparison to life due to the insignificant size of an ant in comparison to the greater scheme of things.

This campaign is based on this simple premise and LIC Lanka’s lifeline will ensure that it’s promise of life insurance for all,is possible.
