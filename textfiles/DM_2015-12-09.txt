Accepting UK help for military reforms dangerous: GL
	
An offer by the UK to provide UKP six million to upgrade Sri Lankan Armed forces and a move followed by the offer to appoint the Military Attach of the UK High Commission in New Delhi to oversee these reforms were detrimental to the national security of the country, former External Affairs Minister Professor G.L. Peiris said today.
UK Prime Minister David Cameron had made an offer to President Maithripala Sirisena six million pounds to upgrade the Sri Lankan military during his visit to Malta.
Prof. Peiris said a government which had self-respect should not accept such offers given by any country to reform its own Armed forces. He said the requirement to reform the armed forces should come within a country and not from outside.
A government should spend for the requirements of its own armed forces. Accepting funds to reform armed forces from other countries without any prior request is very dangerous. Apart from the offer, the UK will appoint its Military Attach of the UK High Commission in New Delhi to observe as to how the funds should be spent, when reforming our armed forces, he told a news conference held at the Dr. N.M. Perera Centre in Borella (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Thajudeen case: CID says CCTV footage not clear
	
	The Criminal Investigation Department probing into the controversial death of Havelocks rugby star Wasim Thajudeen would seek expert assistance to retrieve the footages captured on CCTV camera system that would reveal a substantial amount of evidence on the suspected murder.
	Police Spokesman ASP Ruwan Gunasekara said detectives would decide on sending the footages to the Department of Computer Science and Engineering of the University of Moratuwa for its expert analysis to retrieve certain visuals.
	He said that according to investigators, the visuals were not very clear in its quality and assistance of the Police IT Division would also be considered in collecting evidence out of that.
	However, according to CID sources the movements of the victims car that was believed to have crashed leading to the suspicious death of the ruggerite had reportedly been captured in some of these footages.
	CID sleuths attached to the Homicide Unit had found it challenging to retrieve the CCTV evidence as a considerable amount of visuals were said to have been deleted voluntarily or involuntarily, when the case was closed couple of years ago.
	Usually the Police CCTV cameras in place at crucial locations in the Greater Colombo City limits are not preserved more than two years.
	Colombo Chief Magistrate hearing the Thajudeens Case is to declare the actual cause of his death by tomorrow (December 10) when the case will be taken up again.
	The five page JMO report to the suspicious death had been handed over to the courts last week. (Kurulu Koojana Kariyakarawana)

Nimal, Welgama clash over SLTB EPF
	
The Minister of Transport Nimal Siripala De Silva and his predecessor Kumara Welgama had a showdown over the payment of EPF to Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) employees in Parliament today.
Welgama who spoke earlier during the Committee Stage debate of the budget criticised the present regime saying the EPF had not been paid to the SLTB employees. He said the payments made by the previous regime had been stopped by the present government.
Also, he said plans are afoot to sell a land belonging to the ministry in Colombo by the present regime.
Minister Nimal Siripala De Silva, who spoke later said the previous government had failed to pay EPF and had not paid the same to the employees for five years, while he had taken initial steps to resolve the issue once he took over the ministry.
The Minister denied that a land was to be sold and said the plot of land was looked at to construct a depot.
"Dont make false statements," Minister De Siva told Welgama.
Minister De Siva ultimately challenged Welgama saying he will do what his predecessor could not do during his tenure as the Transport Minister. (Yohan Perera)

	Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka today displayed several photographs of families of the Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe and Avant Garde Chairman Nissanka Senadhipathi enjoying a holiday in Disneyland, California and also said they are taking measure to arrest the Attorney General as well on his retirement.
	He said there was enough evidence to prove Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapaksa and Senadhipathi are close friends and that was why the Minister was always attempting to protect the Avant Garde Company.
	Earlier, too we claimed that the two are friends but the Minister made no attempt to deny these allegations. We challenge the minister to reject these photos if he can or to say that there had not been such relationship with Avant Garde Chairman, he said.
	He also said that a few, including the justice minister were attempting to protect the maritime company when a number of others who had contributed to the January 8 silent revaluation inclusive of himself, ministers Rajitha Senaratne, Patali Champika Ranawka and Arjuna Ranatunga as well as former president Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga speaking the truth on the company.
	Fonseka denied having any relationship with Nissanka Senadhipathi or having accepting any money from him. We have spoken only once via phone. We have never met. He claims that he offered Rs. 30 million to me, which is not true. If I wanted to accept money from others, I would have accepted the offer made by former president Mahind Rajapaksa to give Rs. 2,000 million and a 100 acre coconut land during the presidential election, he said.
	The pictures which were taken nine years ago show the two families with the Rajapakse and Senadipathi are seen together in limos, taking rides and having meals. (Darshana Sanjeewa)
