Water gushing out of the Upper Kotmale reservoir sluice gate
Since the water level of the Upper Kotmale reservoir has sharply increased following heavy rains experienced in the western slopes of the hill country one automatic sluice gate has opened to release excess water. The engineer-in-charge has warned the people in the lower Kotmale Oya region to exercise caution in using the water for their needs as there may be sudden upsurge of water in the lower banks due to the release of water.
Meanwhile Police have warned motorists along Hatton-Colombo and Nuwara Eliya to take extreme caution as a thick fog had enveloped the region.
