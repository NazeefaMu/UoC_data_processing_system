Law and Order Minister Ranjith Maddumabandara said today that he had instructed to conduct formal and rapid investigation into the incident involving the loss of ‘Ranamayura’ Golden Peacock Award of the late filmmaker Dr Lester James Peries that was stolen from his residence.

The award was stolen Wednesday morning while his funeral service was in progress.

The minister said he had instructed the police to conduct an investigation under a Deputy Inspector General (DIG).

“ If the award was stolen by someone intentionally it was an insult to humanity more than a theft,” the minister said.

He said the persons involved in the incident would be identified within a short period because investigations are being carried out on a number of areas.

Earlier, National Film Corporation Chairman Sithendra Senaratne said he had informed the Law and Order Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara and the Colombo South Police DIG about this theft.

The Ranamayura Award was given to Mr Peries in 1965 at the India International Film Festival held in New Delhi for the film Gamperaliya, he said.(Darshana Sanjeewa)
