The All Ceylon Private Bus Workers Association (ACPBWA) today said there will be no change to their decision on launching the strike action from midnight against new fines imposed for violating road rules.

Speaking to the Daily Mirror, ACPBWA Convener U.K Kumararathna Renuka said they would not take any step back without holding the strike tonight.

"The sudden increase of new traffic fines was not reasonable as our daily salary is Rs.1,500 and the spot fine is Rs.3,000. If we are fined exorbitant charges," he said.

"We would not be able to look after our families," Mr Renuka said.

The association urged the government not to implement the spot fines until the relevant technical equipment was fixed to the road network Mr Renuka also said.

“We request all the persons who possess a driving license to join with us against new fines imposed for violating road rules,” he said.

The private drivers of bowser, container and three-wheeler drivers of Colombo would join the protest he said. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)
