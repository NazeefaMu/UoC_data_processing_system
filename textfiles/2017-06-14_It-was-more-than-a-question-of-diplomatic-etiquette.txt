It was more than a question of diplomatic etiquette


	



 

One of the Blue party senior purohitas in yahapalanaya attended a function hosted by an envoy of a neighboring country. 

 


The function over, the deputy envoy approached our purohita for a chat and suddenly asked a question that took our man by surprise: “Why are you so averse to the joint project of our two countries?”


Suppressing his anger at the undiplomatic query raised by the diplomat, the purohita replied that the country was going to be the loser by the proposed tank deal and he would oppose any deal that could place the country at a disadvantage.


The deputy envoy who appeared set to throw all norms of diplomatic propriety to the four winds presently made a remark that gave the senior purohita a jolt. “You are antagonistic towards our country. That’s the reason for your opposition to this project!”


The purohita replied in a firm tone: “I am not opposed to your country. I only love my country. I am not going to change my stance on this project come what may!”


Finding that the purohita was not prepared to take things lying down, the deputy envoy made a hasty retreat, they say.
