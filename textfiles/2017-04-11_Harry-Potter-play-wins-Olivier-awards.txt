LONDON (Daily Mail, London/AP) - J.K. Rowling’s boy wizard bewitched the page and the screen, and stage sequel “Harry Potter and the Cursed Child” cast its spell at British theatre’s Olivier Awards on Sunday.   


“Cursed Child” won a record nine prizes, including best new play, at Britain’s equivalent of Broadway’s Tonys.   


The plot for the Harry Potter play picks up 19 years from where Rowling’s last novel left off. It depicts Harry and his friends as adults and follows the adventures of their offspring at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.   


Written by Jack Thorne from a story co-written by Rowling, it has been a critical hit and box-office behemoth since opening in July at London’s Palace Theatre, and plans are afoot to send it to Broadway next year.   


Swaziland-born Dumezweni said she was honoured to play Hermione, one of Rowling’s most beloved characters.
