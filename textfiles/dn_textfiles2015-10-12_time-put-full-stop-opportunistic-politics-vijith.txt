Time to put a full stop to opportunistic politics - Vijith

The so called 'electric chair' bandied by opportunist politicians like Wimal and Gammanpila has been literally broken into smithereens by President Maithripala Sirisena by winning the confidence of the international community. They are now desperately trying to piece it together to make an attic, said Irrigation and Water Management Minister Vijith Vijayamuni de Soysa.
He said the time has now come to put a full stop to this type of opportunistic politics which had no feeling towards the country. The minister made these comments to the media after calling on the Most Ven. Tibbotuwawe Sri Siddhartha Sumangala Mahanayake Thera of the Malwatte Chapter at his temple in Kandy and receiving his blessings on October 9.
He said these opportunists were trying to disrupt parliamentary sitings at every turn with utter disregard to parliamentary traditions and standing orders and this was creating a bad example to the newly elected members having their debut in Parliament.
The behaviour of these MPs was unsuitable even for a death donation society, he said.
De Soysa said the newly elected MPs should strive hard to engage in disciplined politics by using the Parliament library and associating themselves with respected people in the House.
The minister said these new MPs who come from respectable families should be protected from the influence of undesirable elements and he hoped to implement a programme in this connection after consulting the President.
