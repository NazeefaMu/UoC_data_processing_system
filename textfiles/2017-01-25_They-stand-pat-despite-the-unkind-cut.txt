Three top team members have been hamstrung due to funds to their Ministries being deliberately blocked by a powerful colleague, they say.

 


The three top team members in question are known to be bold critics of certain moves by the government and it is believed that funds to their Ministries are being blocked by way of punitive action against them.


Not to be outdone, the three top team members – a ‘doctor’, an engineer and a lawyer - are said to have hit upon an alternative means of raising funds for the smooth running of their Ministries. The trio now in an ugly mood over the ‘unkind cut’ are planning to raise a big ruckus, our sources say.
