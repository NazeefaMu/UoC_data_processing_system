Plans made to dissolve Parliament shortly: Sarath Fonseka


	

Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka yesterday alleged that plans are being made to dissolve Parliament shortly.

Fonseka told a media briefing that dissolution of the House would be unconstitutional as President could do it only after the term of Parliament reaches four and a half year of its current term.

He also alleged that plans are also being made to come up with a false story on a plot to assassinate President. “Plans are being made to bribe an underworld figure to make him say that I have given him the contract to assassinate the President,” he said. (Yohan Perera)
