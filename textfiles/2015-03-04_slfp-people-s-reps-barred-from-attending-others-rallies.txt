The Central Committee of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) has ruled that its people’s representatives should not attend any rallies organised by other political parties without the approval of the SLFP -- as it was the responsibility of the party members to rally round the party.
SLFP general secretary Anura Priyadarshana Yapa said in statement that the party had also decided that the people’s representatives within the party should refrain from acting on their own and making statements to media -- as that would impinge on party policies.
The statement also said that all of the party’s people’s representatives had been given opportunities to participate in media briefings organised by the party.
Mr. Yapa said the SLFP Central Committee presided over by president Maitripala Sirisena  had decided to reorganise all the organisations of the party and organisations affiliated to it after the appointment of new office bearers of the party to prepare for the upcoming general election.
He said the objective of the party was to obtain a in parliament together with the other parties that had already been in the alliance, with a new vision -- and added that certain regressive forces were acting to weaken this programme.
Mr. Yapa said it was the task of the party members to realise this and take action to prevent the regressive forces from grabbing power for themselves instead of aligning themselves with all the progressive forces.(AS)
