SLFP Ministers S.B.Dissanayake, Dayasiri Jayasekara and Deputy Minister Susantha Punchinilame said they would vote in favour of the No-Confidence Motion against the Prime Minister.

Deputy Minister Punchinilame said his decision to vote supporting the motion would safeguard the SLFP.

“It will be possible to avert the end of the SLFP if all members of the party vote in favour of the motion,” he said. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwadana)
