The Northern Provincial Council (NPC) had become a meaningless institution as it had not used a single cent out of the funds allocated for it by the Central Government, Opposition MP Douglas Devananda told Parliament today.
Mr. Devananda who is an MP representing the Northern District of Jaffna said the funds allocated for the provincial council even in 2013 and 2014 had not been utilized.
He questioned as to whether the Central government would take any steps to reclaim the unutilized funds from the provincial council.
Mr. Devananda recalled that even the ENDLF and EPRLF alliance which formed the North East Provincial council had failed to fulfil political aspirations of the people in the area.
Further, he said the NPC is special compared to other provincial councils as it has to serve a group of people who had been battered by the war.
Leader of the House Lakshman Kiriella who responded, said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe would make a statement on the matter in Parliament soon. (Yohan Perera)
