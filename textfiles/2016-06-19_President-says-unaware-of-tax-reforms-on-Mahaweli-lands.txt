President Maithripala Sirisena said he was not aware about new tax reforms or a new taxation method applied for lands belonging to the Mahaweli Authority.

He was addressing at the opening ceremony of a Relics Mandhir at Sri Bodhiraja Dhamma Institute in Embilipitiya, on an invitation of its Chief Incumbent and the President of Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) Ven. Omalpe Sobitha Thera.

However, he assured that he would look into the matter thoroughly and would take measures to give the maximum relief to the people.

“Ven. Omalpe Sobitha Thera informed me about a change that has taken place in taxation of the lands of Mahaweli Authority,” he said.

“He told me that a new tax method has been implemented. I did not know about such thing. The matter about the change of the Mahaweli taxation was not informed to me. However, I would like to make an assurance that I will pay my attention into the matter and will give every possible relief to the people,” the President said. (Ajith Lal Shantha Udaya, J.
