Find a peaceful solution, respect democratic institutions: MEPs


	

The MPs of the European Parliament (MEPs) on Tuesday called upon all relevant parties in Sri Lanka to find a peaceful and democratic solution to the current impasse and to respect the democratic institutions.

The Chairs of the European Parliament's Committee on Foreign Affairs, David McAllister and the Delegation for Relations with South Asia, Jean Lambert, have expressed concern as regards the decision of President Sirisena to dissolve the Sri Lankan parliament.

In a statement, they said Sri Lanka's commitment to the rule of law, good governance and human rights is key to its prosperity and international reputation, and a fundamental pillar of its relations with the European Union.

“National reconciliation and accountability is key for Sri Lanka's future,” they said.
