MYTH: Ears need to be cleaned regularly by removing wax.  

BUSTED: “Ears do not need to be cleaned by removing wax. Ears should be left alone. The wax will automatically come out. For some people this does not happen. They may have hard wax. For such people, doctors should remove the wax. Patients should not try to remove it themselves. The only thing they can do is put some olive oil or glycerin which will dissolve the wax and cause it to automatically come out. When you try to remove wax, it will be pushed further into the ear.” explained
