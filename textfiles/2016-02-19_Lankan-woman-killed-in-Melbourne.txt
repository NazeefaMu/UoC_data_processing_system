A 48-year-old Lankan woman was found killed in her home at Hoppers Crossing in Melbourne, Australian media reported on Friday.

According to reports, Detective Stuart Bailey said the woman had suffered severe upper body trauma in her Barber Drive home.


Police said there was no history of domestic violence within the family, who moved from Sri Lanka in 1999.


The body of the victim was found at the family's two-storey home about 9:30pm on Thursday after her concerned husband could not contact her.

"The [woman's] husband has attempted to call her from approximately eight o'clock to about 9:30pm and hasn't been able to raise her. He's been quite concerned and couldn't get hold of his son. So he had called one of his associates who had found the door open and the deceased female" Bailey said.

He said the house had not been ransacked, but it was too early to say if anything had been stolen.

Sergeant Bailey would not comment on what caused the woman's death, but said no weapon had been found in the house.
