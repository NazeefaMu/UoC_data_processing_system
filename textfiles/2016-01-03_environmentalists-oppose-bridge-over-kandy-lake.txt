Environmentalists in Kandy have opposed the proposal of the Minister of Highways and Higher Education Lakshman Kiriella to build a bridge over the Kandy Lake citing Kandy Lake is sacred and should not be touched.
Attorney Shantha Ratnayake - Chairman of the Lawyers of Environmentalists Forum said that if a bridge is built over the Kandy Lake the entire landscape would be obliterated and the vision of an aesthetic King who beautified Kandy with the Lake and Pathiruppuwa would be lost.
He said that this move is not in keeping with the inspirations of the Kandy people.
“The only remaining beauty of Kandy is the Sri Dalada Maligawa and the Kandy Lake. If this is lost, we are keeping nothing for our children,” he said. (L.B. Senaratne)Related : Bridge over Kandy Lake to ease traffic: Kiriella
