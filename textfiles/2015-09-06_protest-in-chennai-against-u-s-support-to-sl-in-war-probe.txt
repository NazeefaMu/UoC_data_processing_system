	As a mark of protest against the U.S. supporting Sri Lanka in war crime probe, a group of members from Ilaiya Thalaimurai Koottamaippu, an outfit comprising youngsters, threw rotten chicken waste into a KFC outlet in Ashok Nagar in central India on Saturday afternoon.
	The group also attempted to stage a protest outside the U.S. Consulate in Chennai. According to police, the group had earlier submitted a petition to the Consulate last month and gave 100 hours time for the U.S. government to change its stand on the investigation into the ‘genocide.’
	“The time given by them expired by Saturday noon. Due to this, a few members of the outfit entered the KFC outlet in Ashok Nagar at 12.45 p.m. and littered it with rotten chicken. They also raised slogans against the U.S.,” a police source said.
	After this, the same group went to the U.S. Consulate. A member attempted to douse himself with petrol on Cathedral Road and tried to barge into the Consulate. The police nabbed him and another member who also attempted to get inside.
	Five members headed by Iniyan were detained.(The Hindu)
