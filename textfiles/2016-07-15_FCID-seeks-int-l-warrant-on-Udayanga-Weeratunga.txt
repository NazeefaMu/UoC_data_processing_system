The FCID today requested Colombo Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne to issue an arrest warrant, through Interpol, for the arrest of one-time Sri Lankan ambassador to Russia, Udayanga Weeratunga and produce him in court on charges of causing a huge financial loss to the Government in the purchase of four Ukraine-built MIG-27 aircraft in 2006.

According to Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID) Inspector Nihal Francis the deal amounted to US$14 million.

Mr. Weeratunga had been noticed to appear in court yesterday but he was not present.

The prosecution told the Magistrate that the police had taken all the appropriate steps to hand over the summons to Mr. Weeratunge.

The Police said they had handed it over to Mr. Weeratunge’s sister who lives in Nugegoda and had also informed the lawyer who holds his Power of Attorney. The copies of the summons were also sent to the email addresses of Mr. Weeratunge.

According to reports Mr. Weeratunga resides in Ukraine and was recently seen in a photograph taken with former president Mahinda Rajapaksa.

The FCID also requested court to notice the Sri Lanka Airforce Legal Department Director to appear in court to clarify as to why the original contract of the MIG deal was not with them.

The Magistrate fixed July 18 to consider the request made by the prosecution. (Shehan Chamika Silva)
