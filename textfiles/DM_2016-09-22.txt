Egypt migrant boat capsize: Hundreds feared dead
	
Survivors from a boat which capsized off the Egyptian coast on Wednesday have told the BBC that hundreds of people may have drowned.
The boat was carrying about 550 migrants when it capsized eight miles (12km) off the coast, they say.
Authorities have rescued 163 people and recovered 42 bodies so far off the port city of Rosetta.
Four suspected traffickers have been detained, according to the AFP news agency.
They are accused of involuntary manslaughter and human trafficking, judicial officials were reported as saying.
The incident came after the EU's border agency warned that increasing numbers of Europe-bound migrants are using Egypt as a departure point.
The UN says that more than 10,000 people have died crossing the Mediterranean towards Europe since 2014.(BBC)

EU top court advised to drop LTTE from terror list
	
An adviser to the European Unions top court said Thursday Hamas and the Tamil Tigers should be taken off the EUs terror list, because the blocs governments failed to present sufficient evidence that the groups participated in terrorist attacks.
The opinion of the European Court of Justices advocate general isnt binding on the courts judges. However, if confirmed, it would settle a yearslong court battle between the Palestinian and Sri Lankan groups and EU governments.
In 2014, the EUs second-highest court ordered Hamas and the Tamil Tigers to be struck off the blocs terror list in two separate decisions. It said at the time that Hamass listing wasnt based on evidence that had been properly examined and confirmed by national authorities, but on factual imputations derived from the press and the internet.
The European Council, which represents EU governments in the blocs lawmaking process, had appealed that decision, arguing that it was relying on a 2001 decision by the U.K. that designated both Hamas and the Tamil Tigers as terrorist groups as well as the terror listing for both groups in the U.S.
Thursdays opinion rejects that argument, following similar reasoning as the 2014 decision. The council cannot rely on facts and evidence found in press articles and information from the internet, Advocate General Eleanor Sharpston said.
Ms. Sharpston also said that the council needed to present to the court information on attacks perpetrated by the groups, and cannot rely on terror listings by countries outside the bloc, such as the U.S., without ensuring that they had sufficient protection of fundamental rights.
A final judgment from the Luxembourg-based ECJ will likely take several months to arrive. (The Wall Street Journal)

GMOA to write to President about Akila
	
The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) said they would hand over a confidential document to President Maithripala Sirisena in order to conduct investigations on the reprehensible enrolment of students by Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam to popular schools.
Addressing a media briefing, GMOA Media Spokesman Dr. Samantha Ananda said many students were continuously enrolled to popular schools in a reprehensible manner even though the minister had made false statements in Parliament regarding the enrolment of several GMOA members children to these schools.
He said the minister had stated that children of GMOA President Dr. Anuruddha Padeniya and its Secretary Dr. Nalinda Herath were reprehensibly enrolled to popular schools with the help of the GMOA. This is absolutely false as Dr. Padeniyas son was enrolled to the school with the bread win basis. Dr. Heraths first child was enrolled to the school as a special exemption given to specialists as his wife was a specialist and the second child passed the Scholarship Examination of the Government and entered a popular school, he added.
He said it was unethical to mention the names of children by the minister as it was against Parliamentary Procedure. He also said the minister was misusing Parliamentary privileges by making false statements.
He said the ministers should be ethically followed the policies in Parliament, rather than criticizing the personal information of other personnel.
Meanwhile, Dr. Herath said the minister was misleading the media and the people by issuing false statements.
He also said they have not received any confirmation list of the enrollments for the request they have made regarding the admission of 200 children of government doctors who had been deprived of entrance to State-run National Schools this year, he added. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

GoPro Karma : Everything You Need To Know
	
Its been two years since GoPro offered a full upgrade to its flagship. But, the wait is over. GoPro just announced its long-awaited flying camera platform: Karma.
Here is everything you need to know about the GoPros Karma.
Karma is the a drone with most portability and versatility. We can just say, its a most versatile drone yet.
A quadcopter, a touchscreen controller, and a stabilizer are the three devices of Karma that are bundled with branded backpack.
The stabilizer that can be removed from the drones body and used as a steady grip and also attaches to existing GoPro mounts so you could strap it to your chest, go mountain-biking, and walk away with nice stable footage.
The Karma can fly with a maximum speed of 35 miles-per-hour, a range of one kilometer, and 20 minutes of flight time.

The backpack offered is so light you barely notice youre wearing it.
Karma has an Innovative controller setup. Unlike the other popular drones, you dont need a smartphone to operate the Karma. The small-ish, clamshell-shaped controller features a touchscreen that will show you what the camera is seeing and handle all of the settings in one place.

GoPro also built something called the Passenger app that effectively lets a second person control the camera while the pilot flies.
GoPro Karma has few autonomous flight options. Pre-programmed options like a Dronie or an Orbit take just a couple of taps on the touchscreen display.
The Karma will work with the new GoPro Hero 5 Black, the Hero 5 Session, as well as the Hero 4 and Hero 3.
That $799 price tag only covers the cost of the Karma, controller, and backpack.
GoPro is offering an $1,099 option with the Hero 5 Black bundled with the drone or a $999 option with the Hero 5 Session.
The Karma drone starts shipping on October 23.

Govt. loses Rs.1bn a day due to high-handed attitude: JO
	
The Government's high-handed attitude had triggered trade union action crippling the activities of three main revenue-collection institutions causing a loss of one billion rupees a day, the joint opposition said today.
MP Dinesh Gunawardane told a news conference that the employees of the Sri Lanka Inland Revenue Department, the Sri Lanka Customs and the Excise Department had resorted to trade union action over what they described as undemocratic action of the Government.
"The activities of these three institutions are at a standstill today. Customs employees have resorted to TU action on the Government's ad hoc approach with regard to amendment of the Customs Ordinance. We have heard that retired officials have been called for duty," he said.
MP Bandula Gunawardane said the Finance Ministry had prepared a document on amending the Customs Ordinance through a committee appointed on an ad hoc basic.
He said the trade unionists were demanding that their views be accommodated through a transparent process. (Kelum Bandara and Yohan Perera)

Continuous remarks made by Minister Lakshman Kiriella with regard to the Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) proceedings into the Central Bank Bond sale scam, raises the question on whether he received a commission from those who were involved in it, COPE member and MP Weerakumara Dissanayake charged yesterday (21).
He said Minister Kiriella had issued statements on behalf of the Bond Sale despite a warning issued by the Speaker not to do so. When the minister goes to such lengths to speak on behalf of the scam it gives us idea that he too was involved in the fraud. Its the responsibility of the COPE to make decisions in this regard", Mr. Dissanayake told a news conference.
He said the Bond Sale scam was not the only issue which is being probed by the COPE but unfortunately the minister seems only interested in talking about the Bond Sale.
The final report of the COPE on the Bond Sale issue is scheduled to be presented in Parliament next month. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Rumpus in Parliament; SF shows photo of Avant Garde chief with minister
	
Minister of Regional Development Sarath Fonseka caused a rumpus in Parliament yesterday by showing a photograph of a government minister and Avant Garde Chief Nissanka Senadhipathi whom he accused of corruption, and also by alleging that a former top state official was behind the killing of Sunday Leader editor Lasantha Wickrematunge.
This was actually a follow up action by Minister Fonseka who had accused several Joint Opposition members of serious acts of corruption.
Drama reigned when angry members of the opposition charged that the minister was violating standing orders by making allegations against individual members.
Joint Opposition member Vasudeva Nanayakkara, raising a point of order, said the minister could not make allegations against individual members according to standing orders. The minister has to bring in a motion if he is to make an allegation against any individual member, he said.
MPs Wimal Weerawansa and Keheliya Rambukwella also came up with similar arguments.
Deputy Speaker Thilanga Sumathipala, who was at the chair, ruled that what the minister said about the MPs would be expunged from the Hansard. Mr. Fonseka said expunging it was unfair as he never claimed that any of the MPs whom he accused had been convicted.
Heated arguments followed this and both minister Fonseka and Joint Opposition members were heard using unparliamentary language. (Yohan Perera and Kelum Bandara)

Rupee ends lower on importer dollar demand
	
REUTERS: The Sri Lankan rupee fell yesterday on importer dollar demand, with currency forwards active in the absence of trading in the spot currency, dealers said, a day after moral suasion by the central bank capped the rupees fall.
Traders were unwilling to trade the spot rupee below 146.00, a level deemed desirable by the central bank, dealers said.
Officials from the central bank were not available for comment.
The central bank has largely not intervened to defend the rupee ever since a dual-tenure sovereign bond issue raised US $1.5 billion in July.
The spot rupee was quoted at 145.90/146.50 per dollar but was not traded. It closed at 145.90/146.30 on Tuesday.
The spot rupee has not been trading because of the fears of the Central Banks moral suasion, but forwards were actively traded, a currency dealer said asking not to be named.

Sanasa Development Bank unveils new logo
	

Sanasa Development Bank PLC (SDB) recently unveiled its new logo as an important aspect of its restructuring programme.
The bank has taken several measures recently to make important changes within the institution in order to provide a wider range of services to the public. The bank has pointed out that this step was taken in order to better reflect its new corporate identity and that as a result, the operations of the bank would be further strengthened.
Although the logo is changed as an external change, the bank emphasises that there is no change whatsoever in the registered name and that one of the main reasons for the introduction of the new logo was the current listing of its shares on the Colombo Stock Exchange.
SDB, which up to now has been established as a skilled financial bank, will from now position itself as a skilled, small and medium entrepreneur bank. For this purpose, it has joined hands with the International Finance Corporation (IFC), which is the private sector arm of the World Bank. In conjunction with this programme, there will be several new value additions to the banks operations and services.
SDB has for long been dedicated to providing financial services to Sri Lankan consumers. SDB can be identified as one which introduced a new dimension to the countrys banking sector by providing services such as skill loan facilities, specially for rural communities that experienced difficulty in obtaining financial services through traditional banking facilities.
While the bank has provided a lifeline for thousands of people to achieve economic prosperity through 19 years of providing a unique service, it can also be identified broadly as a major contributor to the countrys economy. The fame and recognition it has received as a bank that has pioneered assistance to the public towards progress, is proof of SDBs mission and its success.
Explaining the purpose of the changes, SDB Chairperson Samadani Kiriwandeniya said, These new changes have been introduced with a view to carrying forward our mission in a more orderly manner. The change of the logo is also one such step. With this transformation, we will be widening the scope and efficiency of the services extended to the public so far. We will also be opening our doors to afford opportunities for those who have not yet transacted business with us. Our aim is to make a sustained contribution to the economic development of the country while consolidating the unique identity of the bank.
Under the corporate restructuring programme, sectors such as cooperative banking, consumer banking and small and medium-scale entrepreneur solutions will receive greater emphasis. The banks network of branches will be actively involved in this new programme.
We were able to win the confidence of the people of Sri Lanka through some very important services provided over a long time, said SDB General Manager/CEO Nimal Hapuarachchi.
It gives us great satisfaction to have been able to make sustained progress as a bank that made a real change in the very competitive financial services sector. I believe that we could step forward on another unique journey through a fast-tracked strategic programme of work that will add new technology and further develop our operations. It will also be a step that opens up several new professional opportunities for our staff, Hapuarachchi added.

US Secretary of State John Kerry, who met with President Maithripala Sirisena in New York, US, had expressed confidence that the Sri Lankan Government will fulfill its international commitments.
A statement issued by the US State Department said the President and the Secretary, who met on the sidelines of the UNGA, had discussed the strong relationship between the two countries and the first US-Sri Lanka Partnership Dialogue.
The Secretary had commended President Sirisenas leadership in guiding the government in pursuing meaningful reconciliation and justice in Sri Lanka.
The US stands with Sri Lanka on strengthening its economy, advancing good governance and ensuring human rights and democratic participation for all of its citizens, the statement said.
Meanwhile, President Sirisena has said that the government continues the path towards economic progress and reconciliation but the government is facing a lot of challenges from the destabilizing forces in the North as well as the South, who want to deter the reconciliation process.
For example, some of the small minority of the people in the North refused to go back to their lands due to pressure from the extremist groups. Similarly, some Southern groups are engaged in decrying the reconciliation process. But the unity government is determined to implement the intended programs despite such opposition, he said.
According to a statement issued by the President Media Division (PMD), the President had clarified that although there are differences among the policies of the unity government they have agreed upon a broad policy formula and continue to implement it.
Therefore, strengthening the stability of the government remains uncompromised as it is committed to fulfilling aspirations of the people who elected this government on January 08, 2015, he said.

We will strengthen reconciliation to avoid another war: President
	
President Maithripala Sirisena said steps would be taken to strengthen the reconciliation process to avoid the re-occurrence of a war in Sri Lanka.
Addressing the 71st United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) Sessions, the President said the Government was committed to reinforcing the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country.
The President went on to say that the country was taking a democratic path which could only be achieved through persistence. I would like to request the support of other states and international organizations to achieve this objective, he said.
The President also said they aimed at eradicating poverty in Sri Lanka by 2017.
Full statement
I am extremely happy to take part in this 71st Session of the United Nations General Assembly. I wish to bring to the notice of Your Excellencies the current situation in my country. For the last twenty months, I have given the leadership to usher a new era of social, political and economic transformations in my country.
Before I came to power, people in my country were living in fear and suspicion. I could end that period and lay the foundation for strengthening rule of law and restoring democratic rights for the people of Sri Lanka to live happily in a free and democratic society.
My governments intention is to make the people of Sri Lanka one of the happiest among the world communities. For that purpose, the government is committed to strengthening freedom and democracy, while achieving economic prosperity. The government is committed to make the people of Sri Lanka a developed nation.
Poverty is a global challenge. I am determined to alleviate poverty in my country. I declared 2017 as the Year of Alleviation of Poverty in Sri Lanka. I have given lead to creating the basic platform for the people to free themselves poverty in a county that prioritizes economic progress.
Mr. Chairman, Excellencies, Sustainable Development Agenda is upheld as the guiding principles for all nations and institutions lead by United Nations in bringing about economic, social and environmental transformations to make a world a better place. In that, we have identified that economic development plays a key role, while environmental sustainability, specially the Paris Agreement, which, the Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon initiated, will remain a main pillar in our endeavor to bring about the necessary changes in the country.
With the educated younger generations in mind, that national development strategy of Sri Lanka will give prominence to build a green and an innovation-based economy through progressive reforms and planning.
As an Island-Nation, Sri Lanka wishes to make maximum use of the ocean with new light on ocean research, tourism, fisheries and marine resources. The government wants to further improve the free healthcare system and the free education system while bringing in more technology into agriculture and domestic industries in order to ensure that our people live better lives.
In many parts of the world, we see the unfortunate proliferation of anger, hatred, and brutality. I would call that the contemporary society is experiencing a crisis of morality. I believe that all states should pay heed to the cry for moral values. I believe that every society must dedicate itself to raise its share of positive moral values.
Sri Lanka is a Buddhist country, where Theravada Buddhism is practiced. The teachings of the Buddha help us find solutions to many of the burning issues of the contemporary world. Similarly, I am sure the wisdom offered by the great world religions such as Christianity, Hinduism, Islam and others can help us today. As such, I am of the view that we, as states, can strengthen and foster those religions and philosophies that help us look inward.
I take this opportunity to draw the attention of this apex audience to a great obstacle for our progress as the world community. It is the menace of drugs and intoxicants that has beset the societies including the youth and the school children. As the President of Brazil pointed out, illicit drugs have become the most serious challenge faced by our societies today. While endorsing his ideas, I would urge the world community, the United Nations and all the states to commit themselves to fight illegal drugs collectively and individually through a robust international programme that is more organized and stronger than now.
In the domestic front, my government has taken effective measures to strengthen democracy, rule of law and good governance in the country paving the way for a positive change to ensure that there will be no more wars on the soils of my country, Sri Lanka. The reconciliation process that is underway today has learnt from the bitter experience of a brutal war of three decades. It will guarantee that my country will not see the cruelty of war and terrorism again and that all communities will live peacefully in a rational and a free-thinking Sri Lanka. For this noble purpose, Sri Lanka welcomes the collaboration and the blessings of the world.
Sri Lanka, being a free, independent and a sovereign nation with territorial integrity, like all other nations that have gathered here today, will find its own recipe for the reconciliation process and necessary transformation and reform respecting the indigenous thinking, that is essential to and accepted by the local people. Sri Lanka will adhere to a social democratic policy, and work closely with the world towards the progress to prosperity and wisdom along with the rest of the world. After a war that traumatized the nation for three decades, we have started the journey towards reconciliation and lasting peace. However, we have no hurry. We trod each wise step with care, vigilance, patience and persistence. My beloved Sri Lanka has big dreams. I look forward to your blessings and collaboration to accomplish them.
I must thank the United Nations and its offices for the support they give to Sri Lanka. I am honoured to mention the contribution made by the outgoing UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to foster international development, strengthen democracy and human rights. It is a blessing to the humankind.
In conclusion, I emphasize my commitment to empower our youth with the best knowledge in the world and to make Sri Lanka an exemplary democracy in the world. My government will fulfil its responsibilities towards the people and I seek your assistance and blessings in this noble endeavor.
Thank you
May the Triple Gem bless you!
