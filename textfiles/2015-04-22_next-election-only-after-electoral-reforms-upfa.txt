The United People’s Freedom Alliance (UPFA) today emphasised that the general election would be held under the new electoral system despite the time it would take to have them approved under the 20th Amendment to the Constitution.
 
UPFA General Secretary Susuil Premajayantha told the media that the UPFA stance on introducing the 19th and the 20th Amendments were enacted simultanously.
“The people want to do away with the much-despised preferential voting system that had infected the political and electoral environment with many ills. We expect to pass the 20th Amendment soon after the 19th Amendment is passed in parliament shortly.
 I don’t think there are any impediments that obstruct the passage of the 19th Amendment which will be debated on Monday because we command the support of 136 MPs and the United National Party (UNP) 49,” he said but did not confirm whether the 19th Amendment would be put to the vote on Tuesday as announced by the government.
Mr. Premajayantha said the new parliament to be elected under the new electoral system will comprise 255 members -- 165 members including those returned from multi party constituencies will be elected under the first past the post, 66 under the district proportional system and 24 on the national list.
“The UPFA will submit a concept paper on the 20th Amendment shortly based on the formula prepared by Elections Commissioner Mahinda Deshapriya. All party leaders have basically expressed their support to it. Mr. Deshapriya is of the view that only a few months are needed to conclude the delimitation process. The most important aspect is that this formula has addressed the concerns of minor political parties and minority representation,” he said.     
Mr. Premajayantha said if the UPFA and the UNP agree to the proposed amendments to the electoral system then the 20th Amendment could be passed in less than three months to be followed by a general election.
“We need a genuine desire sans personal agendas to introduce the electoral reforms and a consensus between the UPFA and the UNP on the 20th Amendment. We will make sure that general elections will not be held as long as the 19th and the 20th Amendments have been enacted. The electoral reforms on local government polls have already been approved by parliament. It will become law after it is gazetted,” he said.(Sandun A. Jayasekera)
