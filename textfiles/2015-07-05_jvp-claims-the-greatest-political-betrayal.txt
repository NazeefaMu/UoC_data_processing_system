JVP claims the greatest political betrayal


	

President Maitripala Sirisena made the greatest political betrayal in recent political history by agreeing to give nomination to former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) charged today.
Addressing a press conference, JVP General Secretary Tilvin Silva said Mr. Rajapaksa unsuccessfully tried to bribe his way to victory at the January 8th Presidential Election, but 6.2 million people voted against him .
“These people did not have any political interest. They were keen only to end the Rajapaksa family rule. After the defeat, mass scale corruption that took place during that regime was exposed. Alongside, people began to justify their decision to unseat Mr. Rajapaksa.
There were individuals who came out openly against the Rajapaksa rule despite the risk involved. Some members of the United People’s Freedom Alliance (UPFA) also made a huge sacrifice for the victory of the President when they defected from the Rajapaksa rule. All these sacrifices have been betrayed,” he said.
However, Mr. Silva said the forces that defeated the Rajapaksa rule should not be distraught as the JVP was set to give leadership to appear for them and to live up to their aspirations. (Kelum Bandara)
