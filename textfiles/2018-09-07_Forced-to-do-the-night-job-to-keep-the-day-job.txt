Forced to do the night job to keep the day job!


	



 

These employees in the State sector, according to the duty list given to them, are required to supervise construction work undertaken under a countrywide programme. It is, of course, a daytime job. But you might be surprised to hear that a nighttime job too has been assigned to them unofficially: pasting posters on parapet walls or wherever there is some space for the purpose at a public location.

 


These employees have to do this night job whether they like it or not for it matters to the extent whether they should keep their official job or lose it. Because it is an order they have got from their supreme boss, a high political authority.


Whenever there is a ceremonial opening in a village in some distant corner of the country, these employees no matter in which part they are working, are required to put on walls in their respective areas posters announcing the opening.


These employees receive bundles of this kind of posters through official channels almost daily.
A white-collar high-up required to involve himself in this night work project at district level had declined to comply and he had been served with a transfer order by return of post, they say.


The employees affected by this compulsory unofficial night duty had reportedly made representations in writing to the high political authority from time to time for the last three years, but had failed to receive even an acknowledgement, they say.
