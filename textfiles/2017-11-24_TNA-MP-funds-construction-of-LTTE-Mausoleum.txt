TNA MP S. Sridharan had allocated Rs.4 million out of his decentralized budget to renovate the Mahaviru Mausoleum where the bodies of dead LTTE members are buried in Kanakapuram in Kilinochchi, it is reported.

This sum is to be taken out of the decentralized allocations made to the MP for development work of the Kilinochchi District. Approval for this had been granted by both the Karachchi divisional secretariat and the Kilinochchi Divisional Secretariat, it was revealed.

MP Sridharan, during an observation visit to the site, had informed the media that he intends using this money to renovate the graves of the LTTE members that had been there since 2009 and also to construct a protective wall around the cemetery.

A decision was taken at the last meeting of the Kilinochchi District Development Committee to allow a group headed by MP Sridharan to begin renovation work on this cemetery. (Romesh Madushanka)
