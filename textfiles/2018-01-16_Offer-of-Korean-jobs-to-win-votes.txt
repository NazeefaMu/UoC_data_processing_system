This candidate from the Betel leaf party is in the local polls fray in an area considered the home turf of a very high political authority. He is said to be distributing application forms for jobs in Korea among the youth in the area assuring them that the jobs would be theirs if he were elected at the upcoming polls. 

 


The youths who have received the application forms from the candidate have begun attending Korean language classes which have mushroomed overnight, they say. Meanwhile, the Green party candidate and the Pohottuwa candidate in the running for the same local body have in a surprise move decided to use their combined might to defeat the Betel leaf candidate who has forged ahead in the race thanks to the Korean job ruse.
