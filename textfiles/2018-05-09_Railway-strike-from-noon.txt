The Collective of Railway Trade Unions today decided to launch their trade union action from 12.00 noon, Convener Janaka Fernando said.

He told the Daily Mirror they had hoped that the Cabinet at its meetings today would provide a solution to their salary anomalies but decided to go ahead with their strike action because a solution has not been forthcoming.

“The strike scheduled to begin last night was postponed after Minister Sarath Amunugama assured them he would discuss their grievances at today’s Cabinet meeting,” he said.

Mr. Fernando said no trains would leave Colombo Fort Railway Station after 12.00 noon and pointed out that the trains on their way to the Colombo Fort Station will reach fort station uninterrupted while the trains that had already left Fort will reach their destinations as scheduled.

He said the relevant railway authorities should take the responsibility for the inconvenience caused to commuters.

“At the discussions held with Deputy Transport Minister Ashoka Abeysinghe yesterday morning, he had requested for two more weeks to resolve their salary anomalies,” Mr. Fernando said. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama
