The Police would get fingerprints from the seized sports car seized from a house in Piliyandala on Sunday to ascertain the previous user of the vehicle, Police Spokesman SSP Ajith Rohana said.
A sports car (Nissan GT-R) with no ownership documentation was seized from a house at Rathana Mawatha in Makuluduwa, Piliyandala Sunday morning and the residents of the house were unable to provide proper documentation of the vehicle.
“The residents claimed that the car was brought by a friend on the way to sell it but their statements contradict with the statement of the others,”Rohana said.
“Therefore, we will find for the fingerprints on the car as the fingerprints of the previous user should be on the surfaces,” he told a news conference at the Police Headquarters in Colombo.    
The fingerprints might reveal clues on the user or people connected to it and be helpful to trace the owner, he said.  
The SSP said the registration number  on the car (WP KE-1392) was false and no such vehicle had been registered under the said number at the Motor Traffic Department.  
He said the vehicle had been modified by a resident of Minuwangoda.   
“We will ask for a report on this regard from the Commissioner of Motor Traffic,” SSP Rohana said. (Lahiru Pothmulla and Sanath Desmond)
