Red light on Green tea?

What is Hepatitis?
Hepatitis is a term used to describe inflammation (swelling) of the liver. 
It can occur as the result of a viral infection or because the liver is exposed to harmful substances such as alcohol.
Some types of hepatitis will pass without causing permanent damage to the liver.
Other types can persist for many years and cause scarring of the liver (cirrhosis). 
In the most serious cases, it may lead to loss of liver function (liver failure) or liver cancer, which can both be fatal. 
These types of long-lasting hepatitis are known as chronic hepatitis.
Initial symptoms of hepatitis caused by infection are similar to the fluand include: muscle and joint pain a high temperature (fever) of 38ºC (100.4ºF) or above feeling sick being sick headache occasionally, yellowing of the eyes and skin (jaundice)
In many cases hepatitis causes no noticeable symptoms, so when hepatitis is caused by a virus, many people are unaware they are infected. Similarly, many people with hepatitis caused by alcohol are unaware that their drinking is harming their liver.
 
Teenager who drank three cups of green tea a day develops hepatitis and turns YELLOW due to liver damage 16-year-old began feeling dizzy, sick and had joint and stomach pains Went to A&E where she had turned yellow and had hepatitis - liver swelling She had not drunk alcohol or taken drugs but had been drinking green tea
Doctors say an ingredient in the tea, bought online, caused her illness A teenager who developed severe inflammation of the liver was shocked to discover it was due to the green tea she had been drinking to lose weight.
The unidentified 16-year-old girl went to her GP with dizziness, nausea, stomach and joint pains. 
There, the doctor believed it was a urinary tract infection and she was sent home with antibiotics.
But after two doses - and with her symptoms getting worse - she went to the A&E department of a Birmingham hospital.
At this point, she was suffering from jaundice, causing her skin and the whites of her eyes to turn yellow, said doctors describing her case in the journal BMJ Case Reports.
Her condition was so serious that she was deemed to need critical attention as doctors believed she was suffering from hepatitis, a swelling or inflammation of the liver.
Hepatitis can be caused by a virus, or when the liver is exposed to harmful substances such as alcohol.
But the girl, who was originally from Yemen, denied drinking any alcohol, and said she had not taken any over-the-counter medicines such as paracetamol, or illegal drugs.
She had also not travelled abroad recently, where she could have come into contact with a virus causing hepatitis, and had never had a blood transfusion - another way it can occur.
Then, when doctors questioned her again, she admitted to ordering Chinese green tea over the internet, having been told it could aid weight loss..
She had bought two boxes, each containing 100 tea bags, and had been drinking about three cups a day for a few months.
As most of the ingredients were in Chinese, she had no idea what was in the tea.
Doctors immediately ordered her to stop drinking it, and after treatment with fluids and drugs through a drip, the swelling in her liver went down. 
After an investigation, an ingredient in the tea called Camellia sinensis - a shrub whose leaves and buds are used to make drink - was found to have caused the girl’s illness.
Following a short stay in hospital, she was discharged, and two months later her liver function was found to be normal.
Herbal remedies, including tea and supplements with Camellia sinensis, are ‘readily available from unregulated sources such as the internet and are increasingly used’, the authors of the paper wrote.
Green tea has been linked to liver damage in the past, and there are dozens of cases in medical literature documenting people becoming ill after ingesting tea leaf powder, tea infusions and tea extracts, including in diet pills. There are cases where it has lead to patients having such severe liver failure they needed a transplant, and has even caused death, the researchers said.
However the authors did acknowledge that green tea is normally a ‘very safe and healthy drink, with antioxidant properties.’
Furthermore, it is the products that are added to the tea, rather than the freshly made leaves, that have been described as causing illness in medical journals, they said. It could be that other chemicals, particularly used in weight loss products, cause liver inflammation.
Or it may be that the pesticides used on the tea trees are to blame.
‘There is potential for pesticide-induced hepatitis to exist, especially from less regulated products ordered from developing countries over the internet.
They concluded: ‘The use of herbal remedies is under-reported, the breadth of use is under-recognised by clinicians.
‘Our case is a good illustration of this rare but recurring theme.’
