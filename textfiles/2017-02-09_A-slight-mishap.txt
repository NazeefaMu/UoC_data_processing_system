A slight mishap


	

The Speaker’s chair went tumbling today when a presiding member who was sitting on it stood up to give it to another presiding member in Parliament last afternoon.

MP Ananda Kumarasiri who was at the chair stood up to make way for MP Shehan Semasinghe who was to take it, but the chair went tumbling before Mr Semasinghe could sit on it.

The chair was lifted up by some employees who were on duty in the chambers at the time. (Yohan Perera)
