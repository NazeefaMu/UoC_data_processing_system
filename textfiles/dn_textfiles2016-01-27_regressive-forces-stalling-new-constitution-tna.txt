Regressive forces stalling new constitution: TNA

The Tamil National Alliance (TNA) expressing its concerns on the delay to pass the resolution in Parliament to set up the Constitutional Assembly said regressive forces must not be allowed to scuttle the project to introduce a new Constitution.
Addressing a press conference at the Opposition Leader's Office in Colombo yesterday, TNA spokesman and MP M.A. Sumanthiran urged the government to follow through the important step it took to draft a new Constitution. "The debate on the resolution has been put off because the President wants a consensus in Parliament with regard to the mechanism for the drafting of the Constitution. However, that concern of the President should not be used by those regressive forces to scuttle this project.
We have continuously supported the move, but we do not want any dilution in this exercise. The whole exercise is aimed at changing the governance culture of this country and that change must be genuine and have a positive impact in the country. Therefore, it is important that the objectives stated in the preamble of the resolution be achieved and the government move forward without any further delay to set up the Constitutional Assembly," he said.
Responding to a question by a journalist, Sumanthiran stressed that the best way to ensure that the country does not divide is to have a power sharing arrangement that is consistent with the principles of federalism.
"The person who introduced the concept of federalism to this country was S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike in 1926. Therefore, there is no foundation to say Sinhalese people are opposed to federalism in this country. The reason perhaps why the 'Unitary state' is favoured now, is because some people think that is the only way to prevent the country from dividing. We say that it is an arrangement on federal lines that will best ensure that there will not be a call for division in this country. There won't be a necessity to divide, if the people in all parts of the country have an access to the powers of government," he said. However, Sumanthiran said they were more concerned on the content of the power sharing arrangement than its label.
He said it was possible to have discussions based on the draft Constitutional Bill presented with the consensus between Prof. G. L Peiris and Dr. Neelan Thiruchelvam in August 2000.
"That particular Bill was approved by the then Cabinet which included Mahinda Rajapaksa as a minister. He did not object to it. Even the UNP at that time did not object to its provisions related to the sharing of powers. They objected only for the continuing with the executive presidency for a further period of time. Therefore there was adequate consensus from both major parties as to how the Constitution should be," Sumanthiran said. Sumanthiran stressed the political aspiration in the people in the North and East is not separation, but to live in one country with some arrangement by which they can also have a share in governance.
"The issue of sharing of powers of the government is not something new. A change in the governing structure was called for in December 1949 when the ITAK was formed. It has taken all this time and so much of bloodshed for the realisation that we need a new Constitution that shares powers of governance with all the people of this country. Our identical position on political solution has been approved by our people at several elections since 2010. Particularly in August 2015, when we presented our manifesto, we asked our people to treat it as a referendum and give us a mandate to work for this political solution," he said
