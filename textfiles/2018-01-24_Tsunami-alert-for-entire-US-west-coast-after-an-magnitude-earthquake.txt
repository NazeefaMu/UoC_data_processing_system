US, (daily Mail), 23 Jan 2018 -  A tsunami alert has been issued for the entire U.S. west coast following an earthquake striking off southern Alaska.   


The 8.2 magnitude earthquake struck 157miles (256km) southeast of Chiniak, Alaska, at a depth of 6.2miles (10km) at 9.31am GMT on Tuesday, the U.S. Geological Survey said.  


Authorities in Alaska and Canada’s British Columbia have told people living in the coastal areas to evacuate homes and businesses and move to higher ground.   


‘If you are located in this coastal area, move inland to higher ground. Tsunami warnings mean that a tsunami with significant inundation is possible or is already occurring,’ Anchorage Office of Emergency Management said.   A tsunami watch has also been issued for the U.S. west coast - California and Oregon and part of Washington state - and Hawaii.
