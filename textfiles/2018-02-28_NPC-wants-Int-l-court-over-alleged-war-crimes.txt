NPC wants Int’l court over alleged war crimes


	

The Northern Provincial Council (NPC) yesterday passed a resolution to request the UNHRC to establish an International Court to look into the alleged war crimes committed by the armed forces during the wartime in the province.

The resolution, which was submitted by Councillor M.K. Shivajilingam, was passed with a majority at the 117th council session held at the Provincial Council premises at Kaithady.

Mr Shivajilingam said the government had failed to probe into war crime charges though the UNHRC had requested it to do so during the previous UNHRC sessions in Geneva.

“A probe by the Government to solve human rights violations cannot be trusted. Since the latest UNHRC session has begun, a resolution should be sent to it,” he said. (Romesh Madushanka)
