Just in time for the annual Sinhala and Tamil New Year celebrations, Sri Lanka’s premier private sector commercial bank, Hatton National Bank PLC (HNB), announced a new promotion in time for Avurudu for all its cardholders. 
Having tied up with over 150 partner merchants, this year’s promotion will encompass a diverse range of products and services, including a vast selection of the most popular local and international retail brands, in addition to a comprehensive offering from the fine dining, leisure, travel and hotel categories, thus offering HNB cardholders unprecedented value for money and unmatched choice.
Through its latest promotion, HNB cardholders will gain access to a dazzling variety of deals – including up to 50 percent off on selected offers - from over 150 of Sri Lanka’s most popular hotel and retail chains, together with exclusive deals on dining and travel and some of the best discounts on jewellery and lifestyle brands.
“The Sinhala and Tamil new year is naturally a very important time for Sri Lankans. It is a time for family and connections and traditions. We have worked hard to assemble some of Sri Lanka’s most sought-after brands together on a single platform in order to deliver superior value to our customers this holiday season,” HNB Head of Cards Roshantha Jayatunge stated. 
Notably, this year’s promo will also offer cardholders further convenience with its travel, lifestyle and jewellery offers through easy payment plans available for 12 months with no added fees.  
Elaborating on HNB’s overall card strategy, he went on to explain how this year’s Avurudu promotion was curated to meet the needs of an increasingly discerning clientele. 
“HNB stands as the clear leader in retail banking and with this we have seen tremendous interest in our card offerings. Our credit card business continues to be a key contributor towards the overall performance of HNB and this is greatly due to the value that we offer our card holders. We have been providing unique offers for our clients and will continue to do so in the future as well,” he noted. 
Currently, HNB offers credit cards ranging from Visa Classic, Gold, Platinum, Signature and Infinite, as well as MasterCard Regular, Gold and World, while each cardholder is provided with a host of other exclusive benefits including the waiver of joining fees and free supplementary cards with no joining or annual fees.
HNB credit cardholders are also entitled to complimentary overseas travel and health insurance, reimbursement on fuel surcharge and the longest interest free credit period of 55 days for repayments.
