A day after some international media reported that Sri Lankans were among stranded passengers at US airports because of President Trump’s ban on immigration, the US Embassy in Colombo said that “Sri Lanka is not among the seven countries listed in the recent Executive Order suspending entry into the US".

President Trump signed an Executive Order temporarily suspending entry into the United States of individuals from seven countries [Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Iran, Somalia, Libya, and Yemen] under section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act.
