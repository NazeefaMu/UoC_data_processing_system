Listening to all sides is part of our job: Envoys


	

Responding to criticism directed at foreign envoys for meeting with local party representatives, German Ambassador Joern Rohde said that listening to all sides was a part of their job.

Speaking for his foreign counterparts, the German Ambassador stated that the criticism directed at the Canadian High Commissioner and members of the diplomatic community over whom they meet with was unfair.

“Last Tuesday around a dozen envoys including the Canadian High Commissioner and myself met with four leading UFPA MPs and Ministers on their request. We respected their request for confidentiality. Afterwards we were invited to meet the TNA leadership. Diplomatic Community also had meetings with President, Speaker and other stakeholders. To listen to all sides is part of our job!” he tweeted.

Retweeting Ambassador Rohde, Canadian High Commissioner David McKinnon also said, “As my diplomatic colleague says, "To listen to all sides is part of our job.”

Earlier this week, UPFA MP Namal Rajapaksa said UNP, JVP and TNA politicians should meet the people of Sri Lanka rather than the representatives of the international community.

“Interesting to see UNP, JVP and TNA politicians meeting with the members of the international community. Perhaps if more effort was given towards meeting with the people of Sri Lanka and paying heed to their hope for elections, Sri Lanka can finally achieve its fullest potential,” the parliamentarian tweeted.

Canadian High Commissioner David McKinnon replying to Rajapaksa said, “You might ask some of your Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna colleagues who they’re meeting with,”

Rajapaksa then thanked the High Commissioner for his engagement. “Recalling that Sri Lanka remains a sovereign nation and home to a brilliant people, the leaders of Sri Lanka, whoever they may be, should focus on engaging with Sri Lankan people and solving their concerns, including their call for elections,” he replied.
