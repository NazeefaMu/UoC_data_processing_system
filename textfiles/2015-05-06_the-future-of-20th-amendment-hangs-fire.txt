	Now that the 19A is done with, when will the 20th come? This is the often asked question in political circles these days.

Several backbenchers raised this question at a party thrown at Temple Trees on the historic night that saw the passage of the 19th Amendment.
The answer to this question came from a top government authority: “Now you all get ready for the general elections. “
Meanwhile, a rumour making the rounds says that another four big guns of the previous government are about to join the government and that will make an impact on the future of the 20th Amendment.
