Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake said the budget was yet another example of the failed economic path the government had taken since 1977.

“Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera said in his budget speech that his objective was to continue the economic policy of 1977. His policy is dependant on foreign investments and foreign markets instead of trying to make our economy self-sufficient. He is trying to rely on the failed open economic model again,’ he said.

He said the country would fall into more debt next year as Rs.1, 895 billion was now needed to bridge the current budget deficit.

When asked if they saw nothing positive in the budget he said there were some improvements in certain sectors but the budget should be looked at as a whole, not separately. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)
