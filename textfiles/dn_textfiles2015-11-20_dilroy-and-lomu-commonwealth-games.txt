Dilroy and Lomu at Commonwealth Games

Sri Lanka's most recognized rugby referee Dilroy Fernando officiated at the 1998 Commonwealth Games Sevens final played between Fiji and New Zealand that featured the late rugby icon Jonah Lomu.
The match took place at the Petaling Jaya Stadium in Kuala Lumpur in front of over 20,000 spectators.
Rugby Sevens marked its first appearance at a Commonwealth Games at this event and it was an enormous success with New Zealand winning the gold medal with a 21-12 win over Fiji, the reigning world champions. Man of the match was legendary Jonah Lomu.
"The giant ruggerite Lomu was highly emotional after the All Blacks' victory. Although he was a legendary rugby player, he was down to earth, a humble and simple man," said Fernando who had the honour of officiating the final.
"Lomu was overjoyed with the victory which was regarded as their highest achievement apart from the World Cup. It was a wonderful experience to officiate at such a final with legendary players like Lomu," Fernando said.
