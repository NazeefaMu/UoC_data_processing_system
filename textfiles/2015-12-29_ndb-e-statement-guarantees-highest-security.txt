NDB being in the forefront in dynamically taking sustainable initiatives has now introduced a revolutionary e- Statement which is fully integrated with a complete review of the finances and it allows account holders to easily manage their savings. 
Through this futuristic approach the Bank intends to move away from traditional hard-copy statements, posted to customers in a time-honoured manner, the e- Statement also known as the Lifestyle Statement is instant, readily accessible and a soft copy can be saved for future reference. It is an all-round, integrated statement and is more secure than other statements sent by post.
The bank hence has the ability to consolidate across products and/or across the NDB group to give the customer one view and an overall unified statement.

The kids’ e-Statements cater to different age groups, with attractive layouts which are easy to comprehend and fundamentals that involve them in financial discipline. A gamification concept has been introduced to this e-Statement to motivate kids to save more and earn rewards.

Some of the unique product features are self-care and financial analysis capability at the finger tips, 24x7 statement availability on email and internet, personalized and relevant adverts/ promotions, minimizing need to contact the Branch or Call centre with inquiries, enriching user experience, interactive and static PDFs on customer requests etc. The Bank further uses this product as a tool to send out bespoke public awareness messages.
