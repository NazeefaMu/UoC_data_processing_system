Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) MP and parliamentary Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) Chairman Sunil Handunetti yesterday said the members of the committee would have to work with MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage the newest member to appointed by Speaker Karu Jayasuriya.

“It is the Speaker who appoints members to the COPE when political parties represented in Parliament nominate MPs to the committee. I won't express any views on the appointment of Mr Aluthgamage,” he said. “The responsibility of nominating MPs of good character lies with the political parties. If the joint opposition is unable to nominate a proper MP that group has to held be responsible to people,” he added.

Meanwhile, United National Party (UNP) MP Ranjan Ramanayake, who is also a member of COPE, said he had taken the matter up with Speaker Karu Jayasuriya and expressed his objections to the appointment of Mr. Aluthgamage to COPE.

“I discussed this matter with the Speaker and he advised me not leave COPE but to continue the good fight while remaining as one of its members,” he said.

“Someone like Dinesh Gunawardene or Vasudeva Nanayakkra may have been a better choice as they have a better track record,” Mr. Ramanayake said. (Yohan Perera)
