Eye surgeons as members of the college supported the programme and in the year 2007 at its annual conference the college signed an MOU with the Ministry of Health to support and strengthen the activities of the programme.   
Five key areas in eye care service were identified as follows; cataract, child hood blindness, glaucoma, refractive errors, low vision and diabetic retinopathy.   
 Five eye surgeons were appointed as focal point [consultants] and to be in charge. The director general of the Ministry of Health was the national focal point playing a major role in planning, implementating and monitoring the process.   
At a special general meeting of the college in 2006 it was proposed to have a steering committee consisting of consultant eye surgeons. Later on the donors were also invited to the steering committee. 




A bank account for the Vision 2020 programme was opened with the initial deposit from the College of Ophthalmologists and is still under the preview of the college treasurer. The accounts are audited with the college accounts and the audit report is presented at the annual general meeting of the college for approval of the membership. Even at present the admin. staff of the secretariat is recruited by the College of Ophthalmologists and the main signatory to service agreements is also the college.   
In May 2008 an MOU was signed between the College of Ophthalmologists of Sri Lanka, NGOS and the Ministry of Health.   
In the same year, the council of the college requested for the appointment of two medical officers to the secretariat to coordinate the activities of the V 2020.   
The many activities carried out under the five focal points with the participation of the peripheral consultant eye surgeons who were members of college were noteworthy.
