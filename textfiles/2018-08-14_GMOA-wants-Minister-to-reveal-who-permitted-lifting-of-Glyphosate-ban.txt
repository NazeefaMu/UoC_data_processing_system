GMOA wants Minister to reveal who permitted lifting of Glyphosate ban


	

The Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) yesterday urged that Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne should reveal who permitted the lifting of the ban on the controversial weedicide Glyphosate.

Addressing a press briefing GMOA Assistant Secretary Dr Nalinda Herath said the Agriculture Registrar could not permit lifting of the ban arbitrarily.

“The Agriculture Registrar should seek Health Ministry Secretary’s consent before lifting the ban. No one knows whether the Health Ministry Secretary approved this. We expect an explanation from Minister Senaratne if the Secretary had approved this as the Minister too, is against herbicides,” he said.

Further, the GMOA conveyed its gratitude to the Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) for its interest and stance on the matter.

The GMOA also said that the lifting of the ban on Glyphosate was against the sustainable development programme launched under the theme of Wasavisa Nathi Ratak (Poison-free country) by President Maithripala Sirisena, due to its harmful effects.

The GMOA urged the Minister to reveal the officials who were behind the lifting of the ban on Glyphosate. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
