Members of the Parliamentary Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) today held former Central Bank (CB) Governor Arjuna Mahendran's son-in-law Arjun Aloysius and other directors of Perpetual Treasuries responsible for the controversial CB Bond Scam, UNP member of COPE and Deputy Minister Ajith P. Perera said.

The COPE recommended to arrest Aloysius and the other directors and take action in accordance with the penal code, he said

He said the committee had also held several other companies responsible for the scam.

These conclusions came after chaos in the COPE meeting during the past few days as a result of differences in opinion among the members.

When asked about what action would be taken about Arjuna Mahendran, he said more recommendations were yet to be made and any decision if any involving Mahendran would be taken during Thursday's COPE meeting.

He said it would be only possible to present the COPE report to Parliament by Friday (October 28). (Yohan Perera and Kelum Bandara)
