The Syrian presidency said today political initiatives could not work in Syria before terrorism had been wiped out, sticking by its long-held position on how to end the war after its Russian allies called for new elections.
The presidency said in a statement it was clarifying reports that President Bashar al-Assad had told a Russian delegation on Sunday he would be ready to hold early parliamentary and presidential elections called for by his allies in Moscow.
The Russian foreign minister, in an interview broadcast on Saturday, said Syrians needed to prepare for both parliamentary and presidential elections, part of an effort by Moscow to advance a political track towards ending the conflict.
In a statement, the presidency said the Syrian state would welcome any political solution approved by the Syrian people that preserves national unity. (REUTERS)
