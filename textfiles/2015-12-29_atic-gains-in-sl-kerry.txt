The year-2015 marked important democratic gains in countries such as Sri Lanka, Nigeria, Burma and Venezuela, US State Secretary John Kerry has said.
According to the US State Department, he had told the Boston Globe that despite turbulence and tragedy, the past year has provided fresh hope that the world community can come together and tackle even the hardest problems.
“That is good, because the demands of leadership are relentless and, as one calendar is replaced by the next, we must prepare and, indeed, we are preparing for the new tests that await,” he said.
