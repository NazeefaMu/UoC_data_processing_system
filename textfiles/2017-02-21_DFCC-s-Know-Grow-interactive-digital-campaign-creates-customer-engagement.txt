DFCC Bank launched the ‘Know & Grow’ digital campaign to coincide with Independence Day, which was conceptualised by the bank to educate the public on the Sri Lankan flag and its elements.
The digital campaign was created based on the insight that although the Sri Lankan Flag is one of the most searched fields on Google in Sri Lanka, most people are not aware of what each element of the flag stands for. DFCC used this insight to devise a creative digital campaign whereby users were given the chance to assemble the Sri Lankan flag in the interactive gaming interface using the elements, whilst being educated on what each element represents. Those who successfully completed the game were rewarded with a gift, which they could collect from the nearest DFCC branch.campaign, Arjun Fernando – CEO, DFCC Bank, said, “DFCC Bank is continually looking at ways to add value to the citizens of the country. The launch of the Know & Grow campaign through a digital concept this Independence, is an initiative for the public to engage with the Bank and enhance their knowledge. We are particularly pleased to have created an easy-to-use digital interface that is both engaging and one that relates to people of all ages. As a home-grown institution, DFCC Bank is committed to empowering citizens through public interest initiatives while enhancing lives towards growth with our innovative financial solutions.”
