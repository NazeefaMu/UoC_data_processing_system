Promising major social and economic reforms, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said that the government intended to introduce a health insurance scheme this year.
He told members of the Youth Parliament whom he met at Temple Trees this evening that the scheme would be introduced as part of the government’s plan to bring in a health service which suited the 21st century.
“We will also sign agreements with relevant parties to introduce a mega ambulance service this year,” he said; pledging to upgrade healthcare to international standards.
He said several new Bills would be passed this year to enable economic development. These would include the Development (Special Provisions) Bill, Megapolis Bill and the Bill to Facilitate Trade. These would be essential to implement the government’s policy of establishing mega investment zones and a megapolis, he said.
“We concentrated on political reforms in 2015 and will concentrate on economic reforms in 2016,” he said.
He said there was a dire need for a trained and skilled workforce to make the government’s economic development plans work, and a ministerial team comprising Skills Development Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe, Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam, Southern Region Development and Law and Order Minister Sagala Ratnayake and Technology Development and Employment Minister Susil Premajayantha had been put in charge of implementing an expedited training programme for youth to take up the responsibilities of the government's economic development policies.
Referring to the drafting of the new constitution, he said the members of Youth Parliament were welcome to submit proposals.
He said the government intended to use social media to discuss the constitution; he invited the youth to submit their proposals through these. (YP)
