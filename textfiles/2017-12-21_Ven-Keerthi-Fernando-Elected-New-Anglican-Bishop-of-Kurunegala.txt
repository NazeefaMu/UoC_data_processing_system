Ven. Keerthi Fernando Elected New Anglican Bishop of Kurunegala


	



According to a Media Communique, the Venerable Keerthi Fernando has been elected as the new Bishop of Kurunagala. Keerthi is the third Priest to go from Colombo to Kurunagala with the others being Lakdasa de Mel and Lakshman Wickremasinghe.   

Keerthi is from Moratuwa from the Parish of Holy Emmanuel and a product of a Moratuwa School. He had his theological education at our National Ecumenical Seminary at Pilimatalawa. Thereafter he went overseas for his post graduate studies. After returning he taught at his old college including as the Acting Principal.   

It is the tradition at Pilimatalawa that the Anglican Clergy help in the Diocese of Kurunagala. Therefore Keerthi has worked in both Dioceses.   

Keerthi has written books on sermon construction, Inter Faith Dialogue and also music.   

On a personal note, Arlene, Keerthi’s soul mate, once came and told me that she finds my church history notes somewhat difficult. Therefore, I introduced her to Keerthi which ended in marriage in Moratuwa! I was invited for the wedding.   

As a Clergy Person I have been privileged to work in the Diocese of Kurunagala from 1968 to 1989, and I am interested in the future of that Diocese.   

As Keerthi and Arlene with their two children move from Bandarawela to Kurunagala, they certainly have my love, prayers and good wishes.
