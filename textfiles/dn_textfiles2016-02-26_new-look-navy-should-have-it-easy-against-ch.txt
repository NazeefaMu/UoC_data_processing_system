New-look Navy should have it easy against CH

 
The rejuvenated and new-look players of Navy SC rugby team is expected to run circles around the hapless CH and FC side, when they clash in their Dialog 'A' Division Inter- Club League Rugby second round encounter scheduled to take place at Navy Sports Complex in Welisara at 4.30 pm today.
The CH outfit who are lying at the bottom of the table in eighth position received a painstaking 38-3 hammering at the hands of Army SC last week and should expect a tough time again from the Navy.
CH has come into the tournament this year to stamp their class and save heritage of this one-time champion club but have withered and faltered away over the last few years due to the lack of a home ground which is being used for cricket. Also it's noteworthy to mention that CH reached great heights in the 1980s and 1990s and last won the championship 15 years ago under burly winger Ajith Upawansa.
Going on the strength of other teams participating in the league tourney this season the hapless CH and FC side has ended up as the wooden spoonist with all teams targeting them not only for a win but also registering the added bonus point of scoring four or more tries.
In this game against Navy, CH and FC will be led by their sturdy number eight and former Zahira College player Rifkhan Siddiq.
As for the Navy, this entire season they have fielded mostly talented young school rugby players to don the sailors' jersey. Other than a couple of games their think-tank and former national captain Yoshitha Rajapaksa could not turn out for them in the entire second round, hence Navy have found it difficult when confronted with much stronger team to come to terms with them. Perhaps a few experienced players in their ranks could have made them one of the strong contenders for this year's league tournament but sadly it was not to be.
The kicking boots and the tremendous running rugby displayed by their full back former Kingswoodian Thilina Weerasinghe seems spectacular and he should put the sailors up on the score board each time he turns out for them. However it will have to be the combined efforts of the rest of the team members as well; if they are to create any impact at least to grab the upcoming Clifford Cup Knockout Championship this season.
