The Ministry of Prison Reforms and Rehabilitation said yesterday that it would request the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) to investigate the former Acting Chief Medical Officer (ACMO) of the Welikada Prison Hospital, Nirmalie Thenuwara.

Speaking to Daily Mirror, a top ministry official said the Prisons Department had already launched a separate investigation into the allegations levelled against the former ACMO.

Nirmalie Thenuwara is also being investigated by the Health Ministry and the minister had instructed the Health Services Director General to submit a report to the CID with regard to this.

Allegations were levelled against Ms. Thenuwara by several politicians and civil organisations for allegedly granting undue privileges to prison inmates. She had been transferred to the Colombo National Hospital on September 18 under a directive issued by Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
