Rithvik Dhanjani: I would love to romanceKajol!

Vibrant, witty and hard-working these are words that best describe Rithvik Dhanjani. The TV hottie has just turned 27 and is raring to go. He will soon be seen on India’s Best Dramebaaz 2 along with good friend Ravi Dubey. BollywoodLife spoke exclusively to him about working in TV industry and his girl-friend Asha Negi.
Q: What surpries did you get on your birthday?
Asha (Negi) gifted me this awesomely sexy pair of shoes. I just loved them. Now, I know that I have a shoe fetish. It is a super present. Another huge surprise for me was the presence of my childhood friend. He flew down from Dubai and surprised me on my birthday. Every year, I get quite a few surprises but this one ranks amongst the best. I love surprises.
Q: What is the wildest thing you want to do in life?
Talking about doing a wild thing, I can’t think of anything “wild” but I would love to go sky-diving. My good friend, Karan Wahi recently did it in Dubai and his video bowled me over. It too wants that rush of adrenaline.
Q: What do you love about Asha?
What I love about Asha? Well, it’s her innocence, love for me and her tenderness. She is all heart. Asha is a pure soul. The two things I dislike - her laziness and the fact that Asha tends to underestimate herself.
Q: Where do you see yourself five years from now?
Whoa! That’s a great question. I don’t know where I will be five days from now. I hope I will be much closer to achieving my dreams. Then, there is no end to chasing our dreams, it’s an endless pursuit.
Q: Who is the one actress you did like to romance?
There are so many of them (laughs out loud). I hope Asha is not reading this. If I had to name one, it had to be the one and only Kajol.
Q: What does the TV industry mean to you…?
TV industry is home to me. It has made me what I am today. It has given us the kind of popularity that is equivalent to film stars. I feel only the medium is different. A TV star enters your living room every day while you have to buy a ticket to watch a film star. I am very proud of my fraternity.
Q: What do you dislike about the industry?
The fact that it is mass-driven, which means the shows that are truly successful are the ones watched by masses. At times, you can’t connect with what you’re watching onscreen. I believe the change will come but after a period of time.
Q:What do you think about daily soaps?
I am no one to comment on daily soaps. I believe that once people demand different kind of content makers will automatically cater to them.
Q: Would you do a show like Bigg Boss?
No…I like my privacy. I can’t live with the idea of someone watching over me right from the time I wake up. The idea of being confined like that in a house is not very appealing to me.
Q: Whom do you idolize?
I am not a Shah Rukh Khan fan but I really look upto him. His aura, body of work, intelligence makes me respect him immensely. BollywoodLife
