Trial against Duminda and 12 others begin
PC says he saw Duminda assaulting a woman

A Police Constable attached to the Special Task Force (STF) told Colombo High Court yesterday that he saw former MP Duminda Silva arriving at the polling centre at Rahula College, Mulleriyawa and assaulting a woman after asking three women whom they had voted for during the election.
Police Constable Damith Suranga Kumara,30, is the first witness in the case against former Parliamentarian Duminda Silva and 12 others over killing four persons including Bharatha Lakshman Premachandra.
Kumara who was on duty during the incident made this revelation before a special Trial-at-Bar comprising three High Court Judges Shiran Gunaratne, Pathmini N. Ranawaka and C.B.S. Moreis.
The witness said he saw Silva coming in a vehicle and stopping at the polling centre at Rahula College. The witness said a number of people including the former MP got off and went near the polling booth.
“He then asked three women for whom they voted for and assaulted one woman,” he added.
Kumara said he heard one of the women saying she was Solangarachchi’s wife and she voted for her husband.
Evidence was led by Senior State Counsel Thusith Mudalige and both prosecutors and defence concluded recording evidence pertaining to the first witness.
Further trial regarding the case was fixed for today.
The accused indicted before the Colombo High Court are Anura Thushara de Mel, Chandana Jagath Kumara, Chaminda Ravi Jayanath, Lanka Rasanjana, Malaka Sameera, Vidanagamage Amila, Sarath Bandara, Suranga Premalal, Saman Kumara Abeysinghe, Janaka Bandara, Duminda Silva, Rohana Marasinghe and Nagoda Liyanarachchige Chaminda.
They have been indicted by the Attorney General under 17 counts of murder, attempt to murder, causing injuries, unlawful assembly and possessing a firearm.
The accused has been charged for the killing of Premachandra, Dharshana Jayathilaka, Mohamed Azmy and Manimel Kumaraswamy and inflicting gunshot injuries on Premachandra’s bodyguard Rajapurage Gamini after being members of an unlawful assembly on October 8, 2011 at Walpola, Mulleriyawa.
The Court permitted the prosecutors to proceed with the case in the absentia of 10th accused Janaka Bandara who had reportedly gone missing after being abducted by an unknown gang following the murder incident.
Accordingly, 12 accused including former MP Duminda Silva informed court that they were not pleading guilty when the charges were read out in the Court room.
Senior State Counsel Thusitha Mudalige appeared for the Attorney General.
President’s Counsel Anil Silva appeared for 11th accused Duminda Silva. Senior Counsel Asoka Weerasuriya appeared for the second, fourth, sixth, eighth and ninth accused. Counsel Anuja Premaratne appeared for the first accused.
