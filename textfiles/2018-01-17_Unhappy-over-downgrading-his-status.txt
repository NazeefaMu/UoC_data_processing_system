A senior Green high-up holding deputy status in the party had got highly upset over the shabby treatment meted out to him at the party convention held recently. 

 


His grouse number one is that the seat reserved for him was not in keeping with his seniority and status. Grouse number two is that his turn to address the convention was low down in the day’s agenda. 


This party senior hailing from a leadership family is said to have confided his deep disappointment to several close associates, they say.
