 “The weight of this sad time we must obey, speak what we feel, not what we ought to say. The oldest hath borne most. We that are here shall never see so much nor live so long.” – William Shakespeare.
I am feeling the enormous void left by your absence. I am going to miss you so badly. You were more like a mother than a friend to Hillary and me. We were so blessed to have you in our lives. I will remember all the prayers you have sent up to Heaven for us, those wake up calls to check after a court hearing, because a squatter illegally occupies our home.


We remember all the special and vivid memories, images of our Sunday evenings at Calvary Church, when we looked forward to attending services and meeting you. We can never forget your visiting us in Oman, the happiness of having you in our home, and of those meetings where the expatriate Christian community in that part of the world, were blessed to meet you and hear the Word of God.


During that time our spiritual life too changed, hearing you sending up prayers and praises to Heaven at early dawn. All this is in the prism of our memory. Those were the shiniest images from the stream of time that we have of you, beloved Aunty Sylvia.


Your constant communication, reassuring care and concern has touched the core of many for sure. The walls of our hearts will always hold safe the love and caring you had for Hillary and me.


You always reminded us of faith, that no matter what, even if life turns cold at times that God’s love and tenderness will pull us up through the roughest of waters. Your beloved children and family have inherited the same esteemed love you have for God which accompanied you in every step and in every path of your life.


You lived in the light of your faith and your values. Many will speak of you and share their thoughts of your remarkable and unshakable faith in God.


How can we forget that smile of yours, which always meant so much to those who met you, that smile that will never be frozen, beaming now in the marvellous splendour of Heaven.


We here, on earth, will always love you, and miss you so very much.
Charmaine & Hillary Candappa
