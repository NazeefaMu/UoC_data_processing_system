He has come to stay


	



 

The hero of this story is a politico who once chaired a local body in a city suburb. 

 


He acquired much political clout when he was appointed an electoral organizer and a central committee member of his political party in the recent past. 


The politico lost his chair in the local body as well as all perks and privileges attached to it when the local bodies were dissolved by a gazette proclamation.


However, this worthy does not seem to know that he is no longer the chair of the local body and he is not entitled to perks and privileges he enjoyed by virtue of the office he held. He has not handed over his official vehicle to the authorities concerned either. 


Reports say that the politico regularly attends his former office at the local body as usual and often his wife accompanies him to the local body to carry out ‘duties’ assigned by her husband.
Employees of the council are compelled to carry out certain chores of the politico’s household as well. The employees are meekly following the orders given by the husband-wife team fearing possible repercussions, they say.


However, people living in the area openly wonder whether the politico is going to be a permanent unwelcome feature in the area.
