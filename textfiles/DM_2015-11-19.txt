## Title: Fitch assigns Mercantile Investments and Finance BBB(lka)
## Section: Financial News

Fitch assigns Mercantile Investments and Finance BBB(lka)
	
		 		 
		 
			
Fitch Ratings Lanka has assigned Mercantile Investments and Finance PLC (MIF) a national long-term rating of BBB(lka). The outlook is stable. The agency has also assigned the companys outstanding senior, unsecured, debentures a national long-term rating of BBB(lka).
MIFs rating reflects its modest franchise stemming from its long operating history, satisfactory capitalisation and loanbook exposure to less risky customer segments relative to peers. However, its ratings also capture its high risk appetite, which is evident in its substantial exposure to equity investments, low profitability metrics relative to peers and greater reliance on concentrated and short-term funding.
Equity investments accounted for 16.8 percent of total assets at the end of the financial year to March 2015 (FYE15), much higher than the level at similarly rated peers, leaving the company vulnerable to market risk. In addition, MIF is in breach of the regulators rule that limits equity investments to 25 percent of capital funds for nonbank financial institutions, with equity investments at 52.2 percent of capital funds at FYE15.
MIFs ROA has declined to 1.9 percent at end1HFY16 from 3.2 percent at FYE13 largely due to weak net interest margin (NIM) and high impairment charges relative to peers. Fitch believes that a potential increase in operating costs due to branch expansion and an increase in credit costs could hamper operating profitability and internal capital generation.
Fitch views MIFs concentrated deposit base and high negative maturity mismatches as risks to its funding profile. Deposits are the main source of funding for MIF, but its deposit base is highly concentrated compared with similarly rated peers.
MIFs negative mismatches of assets and liabilities of less than one year are higher than that for similarly rated peers. It amounted to 47 percent of equity at end-October 2015, 50 percent at FYE15 and 65 percent at FYE14.
Unutilised credit lines covered 52 percent of the negative mismatches at end-October 2015. Funding lines sourced by MIF by pledging its assets could help to reduce such mismatches.
MIFs regulatory Tier I capital adequacy ratio decreased to 19.6 percent at end-1HFY16 from 21.7 percent at FYE15 (FYE14: 22.5 percent). The loan book increased by 21 percent in FYE15 (FYE14: 17 percent), in line with the industry. Fitch expects a further dilution in capitalisation due to MIFs expanding operations, but believes that capitalisation should remain satisfactory for its current rating.
Fitch believes that MIFs higher exposure to less risky assets, such as motor cars (40 percent of total advances at FYE15) has supported its asset quality. MIFs gross regulatory NPL ratio (FYE15: 4.2 percent) has historically remained below that of the industry.
MIFs outstanding senior debentures are rated at the same level as MIFs national long-term Rating, as the issue ranks equally with the obligations to the companys other senior unsecured creditors.
The company was established in 1964, and is majority owned by the Ondaatjie family, who directly hold 57 percent of MIFs equity. At end-June 2015, MIF accounted for 3.3 percent of nonbank financial institution sector assets in Sri Lanka. MIF mainly provides vehicle financing through lease and hire purchase.
An upgrade of MIFs rating is contingent upon the company significantly reducing its exposure to equity investments, reducing high structural maturity mismatches and deposit concentrations, improving its core profitability and maintaining its capitalisation. A continued increase in MIFs large maturity mismatches and a sustained deterioration in its capitalisation and asset quality relative to its higher rated peers could result in a downgrade.
The senior debt rating will move in tandem with the MIFs national long-term rating.

The government will investigate claims made by the United Nations Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances (UNWGEID) including claims of a secret detention centre operated in Trincomalee where detainees had been allegedly tortured, the Foreign Ministry said today.
Ministry Spokesperson Mahishini Colonne said the UNWGEID had briefed Ministry officials on the conclusions and findings of their investigation prior to making the revelations to the media on Wednesday.
During the discussions held with the ministry, the working group briefed us on their findings inclusive of certain cells maintained in the past. They dont exist anymore. We have told them that the government is willing to investigation whatever the incidents of intimidation and harassment that existed and consider what measures should be taken after further consultations, Ms. Colonne told the weekly news briefing of the Ministry.
She said matters of such nature should be dealt with sensitivity because they involved family members of the victims, who are a vulnerable population. She said the government, at the end of the conclusions of the investigations, would decide as to what action should be taken to prevent such incidents from happening in future.
Ms. Colonne said the members of the UNWGEID were given access to all the locations they wished to visit and to meet any of the people they hoped to meet.
The members of the UN group were quite impressed and surprised at the way they were received by Sri Lanka this time. They were given complete access during their visit in the country. They said they havent experienced full access in most of the countries, she said adding all the security forces including the police have assisted the working group. (Lahiru Pothmulla)WATCH

Former president Mahinda Rajapakse said yesterday, in Kandy, that the executive presidential system would not be changed by this government.
What I feel is that the Executive Presidency will not be changed by this government, he said.
The former president told the media so after paying homage to the Tooth Relic at the Dalada Maligawa on the occasion of his birthday. He then had a discussion with the Diyawadana Nilame of the Dalada Maligawa, Pradeep Nilanga Dela.
Thereafter he called on the Anunayake of the Malwatte Chapter, the Ven Niyangoda Vijitha Siri Thera and had a private discussion. The Venerable Thera spoke to the media saying that, considering what is now taking place in the country, the former president was now seen to be worthy of merit.
The former president also paid a courtesy call on the deputy registrar of Asgiriya Chapter, the Ven Narampanawe Ananda Thera.
Commenting on the Avant Garde case, the former president said, "The Attorney General has ruled that no action could be taken on the Avant Garde case, I regret to note that a large number of employees of Avant Garde will lose their jobs."
He also said that releasing the LTTE cadres, including hardcore Tamil Tigers was an election pledge. "Now they are keeping their promise," he said.

Govt. justifies political appointments in SL missions
	
Though the new government recalled all politically appointed heads and senior officials of Sri Lankan missions overseas back to the country, the government had not said it would not make political appointments in the future, the Foreign Ministry said on Thursday.
Responding to a question that eight out of the new 13 Sri Lankan heads of missions appointed by the Ministry were political appointments, Ministry Spokesperson Mahishini Colonne said the government had never said that no further political appointments would be made. 
We have to resort to suitable and senior officials who didnt belong to the Foreign Service to serve in Sri Lankan missions overseas as the Ministry doesnt have a sufficient number of senior officials to both serve in the ministry and embassies at a given time. Therefore, we have to balance that void. Appointing officials out of the Foreign Service is not something new and practice only in Sri Lanka. Even the US does that, she told a news conference.
The Ministry today announced the names of 13 heads of missions appointed to Sri Lankan embassies and high commissions overseas. Accordingly, new ambassadors were appointed to Austria, China, Indonesia, Italy, Jordan, Myanmar, Palestine, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Africa, Turkey and United Arab Emirates. Mr. Wadiwel Krishnamurthi was appointed as the Deputy High Commissioner to Shanghai.
Former Minister Dr. Karunasena Kodithuwakku was appointed ambassador to China, Darshana Perera to Indonesia and Priyani Wijesekara to Austria.
