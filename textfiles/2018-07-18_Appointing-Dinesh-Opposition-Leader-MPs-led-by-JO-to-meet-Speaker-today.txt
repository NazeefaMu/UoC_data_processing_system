A joint opposition-led coalition of 70 parliamentarians are due to meet Speaker Karu Jayasuriya this afternoon to request the appointment of MP Dinesh Gunawardane as the Opposition Leader in Parliament, an MP said yesterday.

JO National Organiser Dullas Alahapperuma said this was decided at their group meeting which was also attended by 13 MPs of the 16 UPFA MPs who left the government.

“Out of the 92 Opposition MPs, 70 are backing MP Dinesh Gunawardane and we will request the Speaker to appoint him as the Opposition Leader and to recognize us as the official opposition in parliament. Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa has given his blessings in this regard,” the MP told Daily Mirror.

He said the future course of action to make the JO the official opposition in parliament would be taken based on the response given by Speaker Jayasuriya to their initial request today (18). (Lahiru Pothmulla)
