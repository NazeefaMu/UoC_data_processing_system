Sri Lanka picks strong women's hockey team

Sri Lanka has selected a strong squad to represent the women's hockey for the South Asian Games women's hockey championship to be held in Guwahati, India this month.
The team will leave this week and in the initial rounds will play two matches before moving into the knock out stage. This is the first time that a women's hockey championship will be conducted in the South Asian Games for women's hockey. Thus this is going to be a historic of a sort for the women stickers.
The hockey coach of the women's team G G Dharmaratne said that the team is strong in all departments and they have been put through their paces at the Sports Ministry Astro turf in Colombo under the overall instructions of the consultant coach from Pakistan Mohammed Akhlaq.
Coach Dharmaratne said that Sri Lanka women stickers have a good chance of winning a medal at this inaugural championship for women. Our main challengers will be India and Pakistan and if we can overcome one of them then we can be assured of a silver medal and can have a go at the gold medal.
The squad stated below has been approved by the Minister of Sports and the captain has been not appointed up to Tuesday morning.
Making up the squad are three school girls namely Sandaruwani Jayaratne (Sangamitta BV, Matale), Sakuntala Illeperuma (Seetha Devi BV, Kandy) and Mawanjana Ekanayake (Sangamitta BV, Matale). It must be recalled centre half Nawanjana Ekanayake and centre forward Sandaruwani Jayaratne played a crucial role in Sangamittha Balika Vidyalaya winning the National School Games Girls Hockey Championship in 2015. Both are very promising players and Sandaruwani Jayaratne in particular is an energetic forward who could tear into the opponents defence. Sakuntala Illeperuma is the understudy custodian to the experienced JEewanthika Keerthiratne of Sri Lanka Navy. Illeperuma it appears has been preferred to the experience of Nirmani de Silva. Other stickers who could not make this tours are experienced Dharshani Herath, Vajira Rajapakse, Anandi Rajapakse, Sandhya Dayananda and Manisha Dissanayake. These five players have made several tours with the national team including the World League championship and the Asian Championship.
In the squad are two former captains in Chathurika Wijesuriya and Madhushani Jayanetti both from Sri Lanka Navy. It is a matter for conjecture whether either of them will get the captaincy job or a third player will wear the mantle. Among the other contenders are Madura Dharmaratne, Buddhika Gunaratne.
The touring party as approved by the Ministry of Sports: Geethani Abeyratnem Yamuna Wijesuriya, Jeewanthi Keerthiratne (goal keeper), Buddhika Gunaratne, Pradeepa Nilmini, Harshani Wickremasinghe, H Y Shanika Prathana Upeksha, Geethika Damayanthi, Nawanjana Ekanayake, Sandaruwani 'Chocolate' Jayaratne, Sakuntala Illeperuma (goal keeper), W M I D Weerabahu, Chathurika Wijesuriya, Madhushani Jayanetti, K A C T Themiyadasa, P A C D Premasiri.
