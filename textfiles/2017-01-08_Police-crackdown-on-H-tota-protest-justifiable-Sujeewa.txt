The Police crackdowns on Saturday’s protest at Hambantota was completely justifiable since the protestors broke into the function, where Parliament members and Chinese delegations were present, State Minister of International Trade Sujeewa Senasinghe said today.

“They behaved in an unruly manner causing damages to public properties,” he said addressing a media briefing with Minister of Irrigation & Water Resources Management Vijith Wijayamuni Zoysa, at the Government Information Department (GID).

He said the Rajapaksa regime directed the innocent people to create a tense situation by spreading false news among them. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
