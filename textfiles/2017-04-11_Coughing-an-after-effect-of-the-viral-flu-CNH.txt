Patients suffering from the viral flu will experience coughing as a after effect for at least two weeks after being cured, Colombo National Hospital (CNH) Director Anil Jasinghe said today.

He said the viral flu doing the rounds these days was nothing unusual.

“Dengue and Influenza was less contagious when compared with the viral flu which is known to affect children and the elderly. They are different from one another. People should avoid contact with those suffering from the viral flu,” Dr. Jasinghe said and advised people to wear a mask in public places. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)
