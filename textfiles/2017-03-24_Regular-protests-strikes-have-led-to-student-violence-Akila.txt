Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said today the protests and the work stoppage by extremist groups may have led the school children to resort to violence and aggressive behaviour especially during big match season.

He said such behaviour during the big match season had occurred even in the past but unfortunately today the trend seems to be on the rise and needed to be controlled before it gets out of hand.

The minister said the ministry had discussed this matter with principals of leading schools and that he hoped to resolve this matter sooner than later.

He said this at a news conference held at the BMICH to launch the new Peace Education and Reconciliation Unit (PERU) and the National Unity and Reconciliation (ONUR).

“We have recruited 4,000 school principals. There are about 40,000 vacancies for teachers and we will fill those vacancies within the next two years,” the minister said. (Ajith Siriwardana)
