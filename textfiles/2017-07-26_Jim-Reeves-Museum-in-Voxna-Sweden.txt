Jim Reeves Museum in Voxna, Sweden


	



The indefatigable  Jayaratne Perera, President of the Elvis Presley Fan Club, has sent a brochure of the Jim Reeves Museum in Voxna, Sweden. 

It claims to be the world’s only Jim Reeves museum, though another in Nashville, along with a Jim Reeves memorial in Carthage (both in Texas, USA), are cited on the internet.   

In any case, a Jim Reeves museum in Sweden comes as no big surprise since the country’s passion for English pop is well known (ring any bells?). The museum looks well appointed, with hundreds of memorabilia and pictures, and the brochure carries a photo of its guardian together with Joyce Jackson, Jim Reeves’ Secretary.  

 

‘Spotlight’ is the club newsletter and still going strong after so many years. It covers not just the life of Elvis, but also many other figures from the US entertainment industry of the era, such as Jim Reeves, Ricky Nelson, Hank Snow and, surprise, surprise - ABBA.
