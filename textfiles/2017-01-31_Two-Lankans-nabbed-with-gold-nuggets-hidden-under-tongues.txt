Two Sri Lankan men were arrested with 180gramms of gold nuggets worth Rs.1 million hidden under their tongues at Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) this morning while trying to smuggle them out to Trivandrum, India.

BIA Deputy Customs Director Parakrama Basnayake said the men were arrested after monitoring their suspicious behavior as they were unable to speak properly.

During the raid the customs found two unfinished gold nuggets hidden under their tongues and they were trying to go to India at 02.25 this morning by UL 1161, he said.

Investigations revealed the two men in their fifties were siblings.

“They were residents of Kandy and Avissawella. Their passport records indicate that they were frequent travelers to India”, Mr. Basnayake said.

The raid was conducted by the Assistant Customs Superintendents Ms.Sudhiraa Perera, Mahesh Gunatikele, Buddhi Bandara, Tharanga Gunasekera and Rahamathullah Razeem. (Chaturanga Pradeep)
