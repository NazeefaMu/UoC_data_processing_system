If need arises, use tri-forces to remove garbage: Ravi


	

Relevant authorities should take stringent and immediate measures to remove waste material gathered in Colombo within four days, and for this purpose, they may seek the assistance of the tri-forces if necessary, Foreign Affairs Minister Ravi Karunanayake said today.

He made this statement while addressing a ceremony held to lay the foundation stone for a new building at Kanapathi Hindu College in Kotahena.

Minister Karunanayake said the tug-o-war between the Colombo Chief Minister and Linear Ministry over garbage removal should not inconvenience the general public.

He said the nauseating stench of garbage scattered around the city was an eyesore, and that not removing garbage on a regular basis posed serious health hazards to the people.

However, when contacted Colombo Municipal Council Commissioner V.K. Anura, he refuted the allegations saying there was no garbage in the city. (Thilanka Kanakarathna and Sheain Fernandopulle)
