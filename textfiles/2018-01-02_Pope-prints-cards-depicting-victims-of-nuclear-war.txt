The Pope has ordered cards be printed and distributed depicting victims of the nuclear bombing of Nagasaki — captioned ‘the fruit of war’. The harrowing image shows a boy carrying his dead brother on his shoulders while waiting in line at a crematorium. It was captured by US Marine photographer Joe O’Donnell after the nuclear bombs were dropped at the end of World War II. Pope Francis requested that ‘the fruit of war’ be written on the back of the card, accompanied by his signature.  
The harrowing cards comes after the Pope told an anti-nuclear weapon conference that the possession of nuclear weapons was now ‘irrational’.
