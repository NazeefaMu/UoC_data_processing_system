‘Star Wars’ mania at fever pitch before new film opens

 
US: A long time ago, in movie theaters around the world, a pop culture phenomenon was born.
Nearly 40 years after “Star Wars” first hit screens, excitement for next week’s release of the latest installment in the blockbuster space saga is reaching fever pitch.
Fans of Han Solo, Princess Leia and Luke Skywalker are counting the days, hours and minutes until they can see “Star Wars: The Force Awakens,” the continuation of the epic created by George Lucas.
Stars will hit the red carpet for the film’s world premiere in Los Angeles on Monday. The global roll-out will begin on Wednesday in France, Belgium and more than a dozen other countries before it officially hits US theaters Friday.
“Star Wars” has attracted generations of loyal fans ever since the first film arrived in 1997, introducing the world to The Force, Jedi knights, Darth Vader, Wookiees and two clever droids, R2-D2 and C3PO.
The intergalactic tale of good versus evil, friendship, loyalty and love created a defining moment in the history of popular culture and launched one of the biggest movie franchises ever.
The hype around the movie is such that 70 US super-fans are paying up to $5,000 to fly to Paris so they can see the film on Wednesday -- two days before most Americans will have a chance to do so.
Some are making the 18,000-kilometre (11,200-mile) round trip from Los Angeles in one day, taking a bus from Charles de Gaulle airport outside Paris to a nearby cinema to see the movie, before returning to the US the same evening.
“It’s so awesome to see all ages interacting with it in that enthusiastic way,” Oscar-winning actress Lupita Nyong’o, who joins the franchise using motion-capture technology to play pirate Maz Kanata, told AFP.
