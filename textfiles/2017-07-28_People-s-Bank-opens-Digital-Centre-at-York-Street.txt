People’s Bank achieved a unique milestone in its digitalisation drive with the opening of its fully-fledged Digital Centre by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, at York Street, Colombo 1.
Incidentally, it becomes the first fully-digitalized branch, thus creating history in Sri Lanka’s banking industry.

Initially, the customers visiting the Digital Centre will have bank staff on hand to assist them to navigate Express Banking on electronic devices provided by the bank until they feel comfortable to conduct transactions without assistance. The launch of this Digital Centre marks a quantum leap for the bank in its dynamic leadership to become the most digitalised bank by the year 2020, to unlock the benefits of digitalisation for its customers.

Vasantha Kumar, corporate management, government officials and People’s Bank staff as well as clients were among the distinguished guests.


Commenting on the momentous occasion, Fernando said, “People’s Bank has been an integral pillar in the nation’s development by understanding and responding to customer needs and industry trends. As the bank with one of the largest customer bases in Sri Lanka’s banking industry, People’s Bank has demonstrated its leadership status by initiating digitalisation in alignment with the latest consumer and market trends. The launch of the Digital Centre marks a proud milestone in our journey to bring the benefits of digitalisation banking to the nation.”


Explaining the benefits of the new digitalized bank, Kumar added, “The launch of the Digital Centre is a proud moment for us. Customers stepping into this branch can enjoy the benefits of Express Banking to learn how they can conduct transactions in real time right from the moment of opening an account, instant access to e-statements, SMS alerts, debit cards, cash deposit and withdraw, fund transfers, bill payment via mobile, Internet banking and kiosk machines and a variety of other beneficial services to enhance convenience.
