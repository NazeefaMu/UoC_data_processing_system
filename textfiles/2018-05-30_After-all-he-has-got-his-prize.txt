This Diyawanna member, once an associate of Prince Panchaudha, took political refuge in the Compassionate One on the eve of the last mini-polls. 

 


Later he became a star speaker at the Blue party poll rallies and after the polls were over, he requested that he be raised to the status of a governing one in a province; however, his request went unheeded. 


Meanwhile, some members from the Panchaudha group had heard that their erstwhile pal had after all struck gold - in the form of a coconut estate in Wayamba worth Rs.30 million! Now set to go to town with the story, the Panchaudha faithfuls are said to be, nevertheless, perusing documents at a registry to double-check whether the new owner of this estate is a bald headed one familiar to them.
