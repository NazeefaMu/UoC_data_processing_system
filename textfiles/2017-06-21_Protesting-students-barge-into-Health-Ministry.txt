The protestors of the Inter University Students Federation (IUSF) forcibly entered the Health Ministry building at Maradana a short while ago.

The protesting students demanded the abolishment of the private medical faculty at the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM).

The students had also covered the ministry’s sign board reading ‘Suvasiripaya’ with one of their banners which demanded the private medical faculty be abolished.

Earlier today, the Colombo Chief Magistrate issued an order preventing IUSF students from forcibly entering government institutions. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
