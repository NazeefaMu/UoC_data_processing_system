This raging affair of the ex-wife of a senior politico from the South with a young one of the same tribe from the same part of the country is the main topic among the gossipy ones in political circles these days.
The politico from the South who has married again is said to be paying Rs.35,000 a month as maintenance to his divorced wife and her little daughter by him. 
Meanwhile, this fair one having close ties with the cinema, is also getting a monthly allowance from her paramour-politico, who too is a married man with one child, they say.  By the way, this lucky one well-heeled with monetary gains from both her legal and extra-legal relationships had also already extracted Rs.10 million out of the Rs.50 million her ex-husband had been given as inducement to switch his party allegiance.
