The middleman who is suspected to be the brain behind the recently thwarted illegal ferrying of Sri Lankan refugees from Kanniyakumari to Australia has been arrested by Indian police.

On getting information about the possible illegal ferrying of Sri Lankan expatriates via Muttam in Kanniyakumari district to Australia, Q Branch police stepped up vigil in the area and thwarted an attempt by arresting nine persons.

With the information they could extract from the arrested during interrogation, the police arrested five more persons who facilitated hiring of the boat for the illegal voyage.

The police, during the investigation, came to know that each refugee had given up to Rs. 1 lakh to brokers for illegally migrating to Australia. Against this backdrop, the police nabbed one Arul Inba Thevar (55) of Pollachi, who is suspected to be the brain behind the venture. (The Hindu)
