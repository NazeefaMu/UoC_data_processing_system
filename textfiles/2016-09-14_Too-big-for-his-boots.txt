Too big for his boots?


	



 

A government department responsible for law enforcement and public security celebrated its 145th anniversary on a grand scale recently.

 


The Big Boss attended the event as its Chief Guest. The Chair of the august assembly too was present as a guest of honour. The purohita in charge of the related portfolio also participated as a distinguished guest.  


According to the tradition, on occasions such as this, the Chief Guest seated on the stage is flanked by the Guest of Honour and the purohita in charge of the subject at the top table. However, at this event, while the Chair of the assembly was seen seated next to the Big Boss on one side it was the head of the department who took the chair next to the Big Boss on the other side. 


As a result, the purohita in charge of the subject had to take a seat several places away from the Big Boss. 


The affront caused to the purohita concerned has been formally reported to the authorities in the highest echelons for necessary action.


Incidentally, this was not the first occasion where this high-minded departmental head had violated the order of precedence in regard to seating at official functions, they say.
