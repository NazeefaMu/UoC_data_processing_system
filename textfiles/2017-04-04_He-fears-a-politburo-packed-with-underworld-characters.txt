A group of Diyawanna members from the JO camp, attending the death anniversary of the Boralugoda Lion the other day, were hosted to a tea party.

 


They were engaged in political gossip and presently drifted to the subject of the new political party founded by an erstwhile colleague.


At this stage one member addressed a colleague: “Now there’s a rival for you…You might lose your electorate!”


“The party leader is no problem for me, Machang,” replied the other member. “What really frightens me is the politburo. Do you know why? It’s packed with drug barons and underworld characters.”  He rattled off half a dozen aliases of well-known criminals in the country.
