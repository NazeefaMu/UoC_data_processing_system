Public had to maintain his canine pets too


	

The political stalwart of this story was an uncrowned king of yesteryear.

 


A dog lover, the political bigwig was the owner of two mongrels brought up in air-conditioned comfort. Each of them was worth about Rs.700,000, they say. 


When the stalwart was at the zenith of power, the two pooches were maintained at public expense. Two public employees were deployed to attend to the needs of the two pets like feeding, bathing and taking them for regular walks for exercise. They were not losers as dog handlers for they were paid VIP Security Allowance of Rs.5,000 in addition to their normal monthly pay, they say.
