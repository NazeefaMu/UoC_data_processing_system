Grant redress to tea, rubber and paddy farmers in next budget - Dullas

The government should grant redress to tea, rubber and paddy farmers in the next budget by ensuring they are paid the minimum guaranteed price promised, Matara district Member of Parliament Dullas Alahapperuma said.
The tea and rubber industries are facing a serious crisis due to the drop in global sales which has resulted in the farmers not being paid the government guaranteed price of Rs. 80 per kg of green tea leaves and Rs. 350 per kg for rubber, he told a press briefing in Matara yesterday.
The guaranteed purchase price for paddy is Rs. 50 per kilo. Green tea leaves are purchased between Rs. 55 and Rs. 60 while rubber is purchased at Rs. 190 per kg today. Four tea factories in the Matara district have been forced to stop purchasing green tea leaves, Alahapperuma said. "The tea and rubber industry faced a similar crisis in 2008 but former President Mahinda Rajapaksa was able to safeguard the tea and rubber farmers as well as the factories. The present government can take similar action and save the tea and rubber industry. We demand that the tea, rubber and rice paddy farmers receive redress and are safeguarded when the government presents the budget next week," he said.
