A dispute over a mug on a poster


	

An objection made to the display of the mug of a certain politico on an SLTB poster has led to the printing of a new set of posters at a huge additional cost. 




A poster displaying the mug shots of several political stalwarts from both the Green and Betel Leaf parties had been brought out recently to mark the launching of a coordinated operation schedule  to be held in the Wayamba province. A provincial purohita had flown into a rage on seeing the mug shot of a particular politico on the poster and had demanded  the withdrawal of the poster and the display of a new one sans that of the politico he objected to. 


Employees in the public transport sector in Wayamba say that it was a crime to have new posters printed at a huge cost to pander to the whims of a political authority.
