The trade unions of the Railways Department today warned of another work stoppage from Tuesday (21) midnight if the authorities failed to resolve their issues relating to salary anomalies as promised by President Maithripala Sirisena.

Locomotive Engine Operators’ Union (LEOU) Secretary Indika Dodangoda told Daily Mirror that the Railways trade unions had scheduled to launch a work stoppage today since no specific solution had been granted to their grievances at yesterday’s Cabinet meeting.

He said however President Sirisena had again assured them to resolve their issues and added that the trade unions which met today had decided to wait till next Tuesday. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)
