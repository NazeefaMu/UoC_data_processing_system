As part of the anniversary celebrations, 110Burnetters came together to commemorate the agency's 19 years of success. The proceedings kicked off with the lighting of 110 oil lamps by each member of staff to symbolize each employee's creative spirit. A Lemon sapling was also planted at the head office, with the soil brought from each Burnetter’s home, as a symbol of unity, new beginnings and celebration of teamwork. The festivities thereafter concluded with the team enjoying breakfast and a morning of fellowship together. 

In an effort to give back whilst celebrating their success so far, the agency team also partnered with the Sri Lanka Blood Bank, to host a blood donation drive at the head office. A total of 24 donors including many Burnetters came forward and donated 20 pints of blood which will go to help those in need.
