The GMOA said it would complain to the Bribery Commission (BC) tomorrow over the alleged financial misappropriation which had taken place when the government took over the Neville Fernando Teaching Hospital (NFTH).
GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said the government would be spending Rs.3, 000 million annually to maintain the hospital which is greater the than the annual income receiving by the Hambantota Port Deal.
“This amount is even higher than the value of the Hambantota Port Deal which is only Rs.1, 800 million. Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne had caused a huge loss to the country by agreeing to take over NFTH,” he said. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
