In an important symbol of enduring friendship with Sri Lanka, U.S. Ambassador Atul Keshap and the Bureau of Overseas Buildings Operations (OBO) Principal Deputy Director William Moser, alongside local officials, broke ground yesterday on the new U.S. Embassy in Colombo, US Department of State said.

Spokesperson of the US Department of State in Washington, DC, said in a statement that the multi-building complex will be located on the current Embassy site, which has expanded to include an adjacent property. The new 5.7-acre complex will include a Chancery, Marine Security Guard Residence, support buildings, and facilities for the Embassy community. It will provide Embassy employees with a safe, secure, sustainable, and modern workplace.

ZGF Architects, LLP of Portland, Oregon is the design architect and Integrus Architecture of Spokane, Washington is the architect of record. Caddell Construction Co. of Montgomery, Alabama will construct the facility.
Since 1999, as part of the Department’s Capital Security Construction Program, OBO has completed 133 new diplomatic facilities and has an additional 52 projects in design or under construction.

OBO’s mission is to provide safe, secure, and functional facilities that represent the U.S. government to the host nation and support our staff in the achievement of U.S. foreign policy objectives. These facilities should represent American values and the best in American architecture, engineering, technology, sustainability, art, culture, and construction execution.
