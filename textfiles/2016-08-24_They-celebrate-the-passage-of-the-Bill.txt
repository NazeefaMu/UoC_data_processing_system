An all-night dance was held at a foreign diplomatic mission in Colombo to celebrate the passing of the Office of Missing Persons (OMP) Bill in Parliament, they say.

 


Certain people with ties to the HR office in Geneva too had participated in this event.


Meanwhile, a high-ranking diplomat from a leading country in the West reportedly met a prominent political leader at the Parliament lobby on the day the OMP Bill was passed.
