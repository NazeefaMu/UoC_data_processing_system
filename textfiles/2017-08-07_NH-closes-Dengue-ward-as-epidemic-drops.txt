The National Hospital in Colombo will close down its dengue ward from this week citing that the spread of dengue was declining gradually, National Hospital Deputy Director General Dr. Anil Jasinghe said.

Dr. Jasinghe said dengue patients being treated at the hospital had dropped to 185, in contrast to some 400 patients receiving treatment daily some time ago.



He said though this ward would be closed, there were 16 other wards at the National Hospital that would treat patients with dengue fever. (Ranjan Kasthuri)
