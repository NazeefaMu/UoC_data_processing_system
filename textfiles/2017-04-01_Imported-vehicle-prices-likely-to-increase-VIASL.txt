Imported vehicle prices likely to increase: VIASL


	

The prices of imported vehicles is likely to increase because of the increase in the exchange rates, especially the Japanese Yen, Vehicle Importers' Association of Sri Lanka (VIASL) said yesterday.

VIASL Chairman Dinesh Senanayake said the selling rate of a Japanese Yen is Rs.1/40.

“Therefore, a vehicle worth Rs.5 million will be increased by Rs.200,000. This will only effect future vehicle imports,” he said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)
