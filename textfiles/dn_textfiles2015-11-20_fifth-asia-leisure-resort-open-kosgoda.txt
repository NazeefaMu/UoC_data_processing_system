Fifth Asia Leisure Resort to open in Kosgoda

Asia Leisure will open another resort in Kosgoda in December 2016.
Asia Leisure's accelerated thrust on expansion is further cemented with the launch of this, their fifth resort.
The 30 key property with an investment outlay of US$ 5 million shares in the governments drive for increased Foreign Direct Investment with investors consisting of a consortium of Japanese and Sri Lankan parties, with the management of the resort by Asia Leisure.
Asia Leisure Chief Executive Officer, Reyhan Morris said Asia Leisure is bullish on its investment perspective, having already launched two new properties in the last 20 months.
"Kosgoda represents a new dimension of expansion where Asia Leisure is entrusted with delivering expectations of shareholders and other stakeholders through a management contract."
Morris said the Group is currently building their first international resort in the Maldive Islands.
The Group is confident that with global travellers spending more of their dollars on experiences, lifestyle resorts such those by Asia Leisure will gain the most as Sri Lanka emerges to be a top tourism destination.
The resort in Kosgoda has been conceptualised for that breed of new-age traveller who is design-perceptive, technology dependent and consistently craving extraordinary experiences. Asia Leisure is a fully owned subsidiary of Asia Capital PLC.
