	The Opposition, while assuring that the security of the incumbent President and his family would be ensured in the event of his defeat at Thursday’s Presidential Election, urged him to allow immediate transition of power.
	UNP MP Mangala Samaraweera told a media briefing that dissolving Parliament on the day of the election or before would be suicidal as the government would lose its power in Parliament as well, in the event it was defeated at the Presidential Election losing the executive power.
	He said his party had asked its grassroots level members to contain themselves in the event the common candidate emerged victorious at the election and not to harm the opponents.
	Coming up with several allegations he said there were moves to search the UNP Headquarters, Sirikotha and his own residence by the CID, which is said to be looking for a book with a family tree.
	Meanwhile, Mr. Samaraweera said no one could find fault with former President Chandrika Kumaratunga for referring to the late LTTE leader as ‘Mr. Prabakaran’ as the current president himself had referred to the LTTE leader the same way in 2005.
	“However, we are not asking the people to respect Prabahakaran,” he added.(Yohan Perera and Darshana Sanjeewa)
