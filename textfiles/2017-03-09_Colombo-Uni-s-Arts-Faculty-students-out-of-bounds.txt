The second, third and fourth year Arts Faculty students of the Colombo University were placed out of bounds following a clash that took place yesterday, Vice Chancellor Prof. Lakshman Dissanayake said today.

Prof. Dissanayake told the Daily Mirror that measures had been placed after a clash broke out between two groups of students over the forthcoming student council election at the university.

“We have advised the students to vacate the hostel by yesterday night for their own security. The students connected to this clash are staying at the same hostel. Therefore there is a possibility of continuing their fights at the hostel again,” he said.

However he said that no student had been suspended in connection with the clash.
He said that already an inquiry had been started over the clash.  

“All the other faculties and academic proceedings for the first year students in the Faculty of Arts will continue as usual,” he said.

The clash took place at the hostel at Ananda Rajakaruna Mawatha in Colombo and the injured students have been admitted to the Colombo National Hospital. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)
