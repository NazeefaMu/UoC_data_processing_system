Abduction case: Dinithas parents told not to comment
	
	Dinitha Aloka Ranasinghes parents today assured Colombo Chief Magistrate Gihan Pilapitiya that they would refrain from commenting to the media nor launch any public protest over the abduction of their daughter or the pending habeas corpus inquiry in Court.
	This assurance was given by her parents Arambage Gamini Ranasinghe and Indira Rodrigo of Lionel Edirisinghe Mawatha in Colombo 5 sequent to a restraining order issued on them.
	The case was taken up for inquiry on a motion filed by parents. Senior Counsel Asoka Weerasuriya and Gamini Perera appearing for the parents said the Magistrate was holding the habeas corpus inquiry on the direction of the High Court to find out whether the girl was being illegally held in custody and to report the findings to the High Court.
	The Counsel said it was not the Magistrates Court but that the District Court was the proper forum for the respondents in the habeas corpus application to express their grievances and obtain any restraining orders.
	They said the respondents had obtained the restraining order from Court by misrepresenting facts and as such requested that the restraining order be invalidated.
	However, Magistrate Pilapitiya ruled that a Magistrate could issue such orders as it was within his or her authority to act as a District Judge.
	The girls parents filed the habeas corpus application in the High Court and citied as respondents -- Eksath Senaratne, Chatura Senaratne, Dr. Sujatha Senaratne, Dr Rajitha Senaratne, Sarupa Manatunge, Osala Herath, Samantha Kumara, Cinnamon Gardens Police OIC K.A.A. Gamage, the Chairman and OIC of the National Child and Womens Bureau and the IGP.
	The Colombo High Court referred the habeas corpus application to be inquired into in the Colombo Magistrates Court. (T. Farook Thajudeen)

Education mess not fault of SB or Amunugama: IUSF
	
	The Inter University Students Federation (IUSF) said today neither former Higher Education Minister S.B. Dissanayake nor current Minister Sarath Amunugama were responsible for the breakdown of the education sector but it was the result of the countrys adverse educational policies.
	IUSF Convener Najith Indika said the Higher Education Minister had taken a another adverse step by issuing a special gazette on May 7 allowing the Malabe South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) to sell Civil and Mechanical Engineering Degrees.
	It is not the ministers who should be faulted but the faulty education policy which through such policies is attempting to bury the free education system in Sri Lanka. SAITM is a dangerous joke which is allowed to belittle education sector. It is pointless to replace higher education ministers if the incumbent government is also encouraging adverse policies on state education, Mr. Najith said.
	He said SAITM did not have the infrastructure facilities to cater to engineering students and added that SAITM needed laboratories for Robotics and Artificial Intelligence, Geology, Hydraulics and Survey Research.
	Mr. Najith said without these basic facilities, SAITM was not able to generate well qualified engineers and it would be disastrous for the country should this trend continue.
	SAITM degrees are only available for the rich who can afford about Rs.12 million even if they had not passed the GCE Advanced Level Exam, he said and pointed out that the crisis facing the higher education sector would not be resolved until the lack of space and funds to provide university admission to those who were successful at the GCE AL had been properly addressed.

This battle between two Deputies has given an added significance to the recent news suggesting a lurking security threat to the New Big Boss, small fry in the department say.

Gotabayas FR petition to be taken up today
	
	The fundamental rights application filed by former defence secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa requesting that an interim injunction be issued against any move to arrest him by the FCID, will be taken up for hearing before the Supreme Court today.
	This petition is to be heard before a three member supreme court bench comprising Justices Eva Wanasundera, Buwaneka Aluvihare and Sarath Abrew.
	In his petition Mr. Rajapaksa has cited Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, the Cabinet of Ministers, the Presidential Secretary, the IGP, the Director of the CID and the DIG in charge of the FCID as respondents.
	The former defence secretary has stated that the FCID was established on February 13 and is headed by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. The FCID has already taken the petitioners brother Basil Rajapaksa and former minister Johnston Fernando into custody.
	In view of the above situation, the petitioner says that he could also be arrested and, therefore, appeals to the Supreme Court for an order staying any action that could lead to his arrest. The petitioner has also asked for an order that the gazette notification issued establishing the FCID be made null and void.

This member representing the Flame in an important council had recently called on a VVIP at his residence to seek the membership of the Blue party. Of course, earlier he had sent out feelers to the Green party and failed to get the greenlight and he had to settle for the second best, they say.
So it would be no surprise, if this provincial  politico, who often doubles as a media personality entered the fray in the Colombo district at the coming general election from the Blue party list.

	For our politicos going into histrionics at May Day rallies is not something unusual and people are also quite used to them.
A certain Minister during his address at the Blue Partys May Day rally heaped praise on a VVIP of the present government for freeing the people from the shackles of slavery. Faces of some Blue stalwarts turned a shade darker when they heard this statement. A Diyawanna member hailing from Hambantota turned livid.
As soon as the Minister concluded his speech, the Hambantota member confronted the colleague from Colombo who had organized the May Day rally.
Look here. Why on earth did you include that fellows name in the list of speakers he demanded. Why the hell couldnt he make any mention about the person who really liberated the country
The Colombo district organiser of the rally had remained quiet as the angry Diyawanna member from Hambantota poured out his wrath on him for several minutes.

	A few Tamil National Alliance (TNA) members of the Northern Provincial Council (NPC) yesterday announced that the period May 13 to 19 would be marked as Tamil Genocide Week and began commemorating the dead with a function in Mullavaikkal in Mullaitivu District where the final battle was fought in 2009, a party member said.
	The military defeated the LTTE on May 19 -- which is marked and celebrated as Victory Day in the south. TNA NPC member M.K. Sivajilingam told Daily Mirror that he regarded this period as the genocide week.
	We lit lamps and offered floral tributes at a small function in Mullavaikkal in Mullaitivu District. This week we will have commemorations throughout the north. We requested the party hierarchy to hold the main function on May 19, he said.
	He said he was backed by a few other members of the TNA in this exercise.
	It is learnt that the TNA, as a party, has not organised any such commemoration. Yet its members will hold separate events to commemorate those in the north who died during the war that ended on May 19, 2009. (Kelum Bandara)

	Former Sri Lanka cricket captain Kumar Sanagakkara was among those who criticsed Andrew Strauss over his handling of the latest Kevin Pietersen saga, questioning Strauss' logic in excluding the English batsman.
	Sangakkara, who plays alongside Pietersen at English county Surrey, tweeted: "I don't trust @KP24 enough for him to play for England but I trust him enough to advise me on ODI cricket" #strausslogic.
	In his new role as the ECB's director of cricket, Strauss announced on Tuesday that Pietersen 's England exile would not end despite posting a career-best 355 not out for Surrey on the same day.
	Former South African skipper Graeme Smith was among others who criticised the move tweeting: 'I see the head boy is making English cricket the laughing stock again! #StraussLogic'

	Both the Green party and the deposed strongmans cabal are pressing that the Diyawanna council be dissolved paving the way for an early general election.
Both parties are keen on going for an early election on Astrological advice, they say. Astrologers have told the Green party leaders that stars would be favourable to them if the election is held before July 17. According to the advice of astrologers whom the cabal leaders have consulted, the deposed strongman becoming the next Prime Minister is a certainty if the general election is held in August. However, the New Big Boss who commands the power to dissolve the council remains unconcerned about the strident calls for dissolution to the much chagrin of the Greens, our sources say.

	This Diyawanna member who once captained a team that won a World Cup is now the Blue party organiser for an electorate which has produced two Prime Ministers.
Recently this politico went round his electorate meeting his constituents from all walks of life.
An elderly person who was among the people the politico met, inquired from him as to why he was going round the electorate alone. We expected the Madam to accompany you whenever you visit this area, the senior citizen added.
The Diyawanna member smiled, but offered no reply.
The elderly person raised the same query again.
Realizing he could not dodge giving an answer, the politico decided to take the old man into his confidence.
Loku Unnehe, the politico addressed the man in a conspiratorial tone. I want to retain intact at least the votes already there for our party in this area. I dont want to lose such sure votes by providing an occasion for someone to indulge in the habit of tongue-lashing various people in my presence.

	This Diyawanna member did a pole-vault to the government party soon after his election to the Diyawanna Council. He was an attendee at the Blue partys May Day rally at Hyde Park.
Getting into an expansive mood, he requested the organisers to list him as a speaker at the rally. In fact, he had thought that his elder brother being a leader of a minority political party with a sizable following in the Colombo district, the organizers would readily welcome his request.
The organisers ignored the Diyawanna members request and the latter flew into a rage. He immediately stepped down from the May Day stage and made a beeline to the Kirillapone May Day rally organised by the deposed strongmans cabal. 
The organisers of the Kirillapone rally received the latest volunteer with open arms and also invited him to address the rally.
And the politico used this opportunity to slam the Maithri- camp of the Blue party left, right and centre, they say.

	Sports Minister Navin Dissanayake will run Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) with the present interim committee till next year, but SLC stakeholders have not shown their pleasure at the decision, two media releases issued yesterday by the Ministry and Stakeholders after a discussion between the parties show.
	The Minister pointed out the importance of the validity of the Interim committee and assured to hold the elections for the Sri Lanka Cricket Board within the month of January 2016 stated the release issued by the Minstry.
	However the former Exco members of the SLC, who represented the stakeholders at the meeting have not agreed to it and wanted to consult all stakeholders to get their views.
	The delegation however insisted that the Hon Minister should expedite the so called investigations in order to hold the elections as early as possible and promised to revert back to the Hon Minister after discussing with the stakeholders about his request stated the release issued by stakeholders.
	Hon Minister also informed the delegation that he had informed the ICC officials that he would have discussions with the stakeholders to resolve this issue amicably as he had wanted time till January next year to have the elections added that release.
	Both parties have however agreed on one point - that the discussions were cordial.
	All in all the discussions were cordial and the delegation and the Hon. Minister agreed to support each other for the larger interest of the game and the Country stated the release from stakeholders while Ministry release stated The discussions were very cordial while the Former Board members assured their fullest cooperation and support to the Minister of Sports Navin Dissanayake to uplift Cricket in the country.
	Meanwhile, Minister Dissanayake told Daily Mirror yesterday that three members of the SLC Interim committee who travelled to Dubai with him indeed took part in the discussion along with him and rejected the media reports that said only he was allowed in for the discussions.
	Minister also revealed that ICC has agreed to release all the due funds to SLC gradually according to a formula.

	An estimated US $ 12 million have been held back by ICC after Minister Dissanayake decided to appoint an interim committee, a decision that has also come under attack from SLC Stakeholders.
	As per our meeting held with the stakeholders on 25th April where a mandate was given to the outgoing Executive committee by them to take appropriate action for denying our legitimate right to elect office bearers of our choice and the subsequent appointment of an Interim committee read the start of the media release issued by stakeholder yesterday.

Interim order stays Gotas anticipated arrest
	
	The Supreme Court today issued an interim order staying the arrest of former defense secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa and granted leave to proceed in the fundamental rights petition filed by him.
	A two-judge bench comprising Justices Eva Wanasundera and Sarath De Abrew issued the interim order having heard submissions by counsel representing Mr. Rajapaksa and the Attorney General.
	When the matter was taken up for inquiry at 10.45 a.m., Supreme Court Judge Buwaneka Aluwihare who was appointed to hear the case with the other two judges stepped down, citing personal reasons. He said he was unable to hear the case, at which point Justice Eva Wanasundera sent the file to the Chief Justice for his direction.
	Counsel Romesh De Silva PC said he would remain in courtroom 502 until CJs direction was received. The direction was delivered within five minutes. He directed Justice Eva Wanasundera and Sarath De Abrew to hear the petition.
	Thereafter after an interval in which other cases were taken up, Justice Buwaneka Aluwihare recused himself from the bench at 12.30 p.m. The case resumed soon after with Counsel Romesh De Silva PC making his submissions.
	He said that the Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID) was ultra vires and all actions flowing from it are therefore illegal. Mr. De Silva said the FCID had arrested 10 people so far with each of them being called in for questioning and then arrested. Justice Wanasundera asked Counsel whether any person who had visited the FCID had walked out without being arrested.
	No. Not to my knowledge he replied, having said that Mr. Rajapaksa himself had visited the FCID previously.
	Counsel said the move to arrest Mr. Rajapaksa was politically motivated and provided paper cuttings of Daily Newspapers which stated that the National Executive Council had unanimously decided to arrest Mr. Rajapaksa.
	The Cabinet Spokesman Rajitha Senaratne has said the National Executive Council has decided to arrest Mr. Rajapaksa. How could he have said that This newspaper report has not been denied to date, he said.
	Mr. De Silva while elaborating on the Police Ordinance said that the IGP had derogated his power to the Cabinet, through the FCID.
	The IGP is acting like a puppet and is carrying out his duties like one, he said.
	Mr. De Silva spoke on the concept of arrest, saying a suspect could only be arrested in the event he was likely to abscond Court or interfere with the investigations.
	Speaking on behalf of the respondents, Deputy Solicitor General Arjun Obeysekara said the FCID was constituted by the IGP under the law and the Police ordinance upon direction by the Cabinet of Ministers.
	The Cabinet of Ministers or the executive have the power to make such direction in the wake of serious financial crimes which have taken place he said.
	The DSG said the FCID was an independent Unit and acted only on the instructions of the IGP and was not politically motivated. He said though various politicians made statements the FCID took decisions on the instructions the IGP and within the law.
	The DSG said that an arrest is made according to the Criminal Procedure Code and the actions are not arbitrary nor is it an infringement of a persons fundamental right.
	Having heard the submissions of the Counsel the Court granted interim relief as prayed for in the Petition, which prevents his arrest until the final determination of the case. The relief sought is not confined to the FCID, and prevents the arrest of Mr. Rajapaksa by any officer of the state.
	Romesh De Silva PC, with Ali Sabry PC and Sugath Caldera instructed by Sanath Wijewardane appeared for the petitioner while Deputy Solicitor General Arjun Obeysekara with Gayesha Wijemanne appeared for the respondents.
	The petitioner cited Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and the members of the Cabinet, Secretary to the Cabinet, Secretary to the President, IGP N.K. Ilangakoon, CID Director B.R.S.R. Nagahamulla, FCID DIG Ravi Waidyalankara and the Attorney General as respondents.
	The petitioner filed the FR petition seeking an Interim Order preventing the police from arresting him over several purported investigations and a declaration that the gazette notification on the FCID was ultra vires.
	He said in his petition that consequent to the Presidential Election held on November 17, 2005, his brother Mahinda Rajapaksa was elected the President and accepted the post of Defencd Secretary in December 2005 - an area in which he possessed large wealth of knowledge and experience having served the Sri Lanka Army.
	Mr. Rajapaksa said the members of the National Executive Council (NEC) had in several newspapers and media channels continued their malicious and vicious campaign against him and the members of his family alleging that they had staged a coup on the night of the elections to cling to power contrary to the mandate of the people.
	The members of NEC who were instrumental in articulating the allegations continued with their efforts to make false and baseless allegations against him over the floating armoury docked at the Galle harbour with a large consignment of weapons and ammunition, allegations of corruptions and irregularities in the purchase of MiG 27 in 2006, purported share manipulation at Lanka Hospitals Limited and the leasing of aircraft during his tenure as Chairman at Mihin Lanka.
	In the light of the backdrop of the events transpired, there was a serious likelihood that, if he appeared before the FCID, he would be arrested pending investigations, without rationally considering the explanations and clarifications he could provide, he bemoans.
	Mr. Rajapaksa said the FCID was established to look in to complaints forwarded by the cabinet sub-committee headed by the Prime Minister who was also a member of the National Executive Council.
	He said in the light of the complaints being forwarded by the Sub-Committee, there was a likelihood that the FCID is biased and coerced and could make a finding adverse to him.
	Counsel de Silva said the Cabinet had the power to supervise the investigation of the FCID and the Secretariat of FCID is under the patronage of the Prime Minister.
	He said the petitioner was expected to attend an inquiry of the FCID within three days.
	Mr. De Silva said that every person has the right to life and their liberty could not be taken on narrow grounds and it is just allegation.
	The DSG countered these submissions in terms of Section 20 of the Police Ordinance and that the IGP could frame any orders and regulations and was empowered to set up any divisions similarly as the TID and the Fraud Bureau.
	He said there was a need to setup a separate unit to investigate the crimes with the magnitude and matter they had been carried out.
	The FCID is under the IGP and headed by a DIG and not supervised by the Cabinet, the DSG said.
	He said Section 109 of the Criminal Code of Procedure would apply and a B Report was filed before the Magistrates Court and Magistrates permission would be sought for judicial custody of the suspect and that there was no mad rush to arrest the petitioner.
	The DSG said there was a law under which the investigation should be conducted and under Section 24 of the Criminal Code of Procedure, the judiciary could make an order for the arrest to assist the investigation.
	He said that the petitioner was given enough time to come to the FCID but on his request, the date for his appearance before the FCID was extended and nowhere was it stated that he would be arrested. (S. Selvanayagam, Lakmal Sooriyagoda and Hafeel Farisz)

Kim Jong-Un executes defence minister for sleeping
	
North Korea's defence minister has been publicly executed with an anti-aircraft gun for falling asleep during military meetings and answering back to leader Kim Jong-Un, Daily Mail reported today.
Hyon Yong-Chol, 66, who was named head of North Korea's military in 2012, was killed in front of hundreds of bloodthirsty officials at a military camp in the capital Pyongyang on April 30.
It is not the first time a ZPU-4 anti-aircraft gun has been used for executions in North Korea, with recently released satellite images showing a number of unidentified people being killed using the brutal method at the same camp last October.
Hyon was apparently caught falling asleep during formal military events and is said to have also spoken back to Kim Jong-Un on several occasions.
Hong Hyun-ik, chief researcher at the Sejong Institute, a security think tank based in Seoul, told local broadcaster YTN that the anti-artillery gun used would have left the body utterly unrecognisable.

Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa had sent a letter of demand to Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera demanding Rs.1 billion as compensations over a statement alleged to have made by the minister during a news conference.
Athula Priyadarshana de Silva, the Counsel who had sent the letter on behalf of the former President, said that the statements made by Minister Samaraweera were defamatory and had made with the sole intention of insulting Mr. Rajapaksa.
Though the damages caused to the image of my client are beyond estimation, he had estimated it to a Rs. 1 billion for the sake of legal requirements, the counsel said.
The letter dated on May 12 noted that if the Minister failed to pay Rs. 1 billion within 21 days, legal action would be taken against him to obtain the amount.
The letter said Minister Samaraweera had alleged Mr. Rajapaksa and family members of theft, alleging their wealth was USD 18 billion and Mr. Rajapaksa was the first trillionaire of Sri Lanka.
The letter rejected the allegations as completely false and had no base.(Lahiru Pothmulla)

SL woman pleads in UK not to send her back
	
	A Cromer woman who claimed she was raped and then tortured with cigarettes by security forces in Sri Lanka has pleaded with the Home Office not to send her back, the Norfolk Eastern Daily Press reported.
	Cromer is a coastal town and civil parish in north Norfolk, England.
	The report said:
	Her husband said he escaped from the soldiers after being shot and wounded and came to Cromer in 1998.
	The alleged victim recently joined her husband in the seaside town.
	The couples background was revealed at an Immigration and Asylum Tribunal in Birmingham.
	The woman appealed against a Home Office decision to deport her back to Sri Lanka after rejecting her application as an asylum seeker.
	John Smith, representing the Home Office, said they refused the womans application because she had been unreliable in making claims about her bank statements and employment.
	The woman, who denied these claims, told the tribunal she was held in captivity, raped by security forces in Sri Lanka and burned on her body with cigarettes.
	She expressed fears she would face further danger should she be sent back.
	Emma Rutherford, representing the woman, told the tribunal her client might commit suicide if separated from her husband and sent back to Sri Lanka.
	The husband said he was diabetic and his wife did the cooking and looked after him.
	He added: I do not want to return to Sri Lanka because I like the food in Cromer and dislike the weather in Sri Lanka.
	I escaped from the security forces to reach England after being shot and I still have the wounds to prove it.

	It would urge the government to conduct an inquiry in line with the inquiries being carried out by Financial Crime Investigation Division (FCID) against officials and opposition members.
	The motion is also a message to President Maithripala Suirisena not to ignore this matter and to remove Mr. Mahendran from his post if parliament passes a motion against him. A motion against Mr. Mahendran in already in the Order Paper with the signatures of 91 members including those of several ministers, Mr. De Silva said.
	He said a Rs.5,000 currency note has been issued with the signature of the Central Bank Governor who is a Singaporean and pointed out that signing a Sri Lanka currency note in English by a foreigner was a stigma on Sri Lanka and would lose investor confidence on the country.
	Commenting on FCID investigations and subsequent arrest of opposition politicians and public officials on trumped up charges under the provisions of the Public Property Act (PPA), Mr. De Silva said the allegations were invalid and they could not be charged and remanded under the PPA.
	He said the SLFP was not opposed to inquiries into financial frauds and corruption if they were conducted in an unbiased and lawful manner by the proper law enforcement agencies.
	Mr. De Silva said the report by the three-member committee set up to inquiry into the controversial bond issue was submitted to Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe but it had still not been released or presented in parliament as promised raising more questions than answers.
	Responding to a journalist on the power struggle at some provincial council, Mr. De Silva said the courts had totally vindicated the position held by the SLFP.
	The UNP has changed the power equation in Uva and attempted a similar manoeuver at several other provinces using affidavits submitted by a few UPFA members. The Court of Appeal has given a verdict in favour of the incumbent Chief Ministers and said power equation in the Provincial Councils could not be changed through affidavits. While bowing down to the Court of Appeal verdict, we will take strict disciplinary action against all UPFA members who violated the party stand and gave affidavits to unseat UPFA Chief Ministers, he said.

She is in. He is out.
	
	The Charming Lass from Kolonnawa who had been sulking for some time is somewhat cheery again, they say.
This change had come over her after being nominated as a member of the Central Committee.
Quite recently the Lass received news that made her happier still: that the party hierarchy had decided to field her on the Colombo district list as the organiser for Kolonnawa, the stronghold of her slain father and to shift her arch rival Dumi to Avissawella.
Dumi who has pitched camp in Kolonnawa is unhappy over the new development. But this setback is nothing compared to the other problems he is facing at the moment, they say.

SL frees 37 Indian fishermen
	
	Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena today ordered the release of 37 Indian fishermen lodged in various prisons of the island nation after a meeting with a delegation of five Indian fishermen.
	President of Rameswaram Fishermen's Association Sesuraja, who led the team to Sri Lanka, told PTI that Sirisena told them that the fishermen would be released soon.
	But the Sri Lankan President did not mention about the Indian boats still in detention in Lanka, he said.
	N Devadas, another leader of the association who was also a member in the delegation, said they also sought permission from Sri Lanka to fish in the Palk Straits as they were frequently attacked and arrested by the Lankan navy.
	Sesuraja said they met Sirisena in a bid to sort out various problems faced by them while fishing in the traditional fishing areas in Palk Strait.
	He said Sri Lanka had agreed to take steps for holding official level and fishermen level talks to sort problems faced by fishermen of the two countries.

	A certain Ministry Secretary has confided in a colleague that it has become an imperative for him to move out of his Ministry with the least delay if he is to keep alive the hope of retiring from service with his pension safe and sound.
An outside authority has begun giving me instructions regarding payments our Ministry is required to make to certain contractors, the Ministry Secretary had explained to his colleague.
This outside authority is said to be a holder of an important office connected with Finance.
Following discreet inquiries he made, the harried Ministry Secretary had learnt that somebody was collecting a five per cent commission from the contractors to whom he was making payments expeditiously on the orders of the Finance Authority.
