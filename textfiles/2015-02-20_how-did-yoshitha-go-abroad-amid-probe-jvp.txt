The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) today criticised the decision to allow former President’s son Lieutenant Yoshitha Rajapaksa to leave the country when there was an ongoing investigation into allegations made against him.
JVP MP Vijitha Herath said the defence secretary had assured they would appoint a committee to look into the privileges afforded to Mr. Rajapaksa.
“We complained that Yoshitha Rajapaksa had given special privileges during the previous government. But in the wake of all these allegations and ongoing investigations, the navy has granted him three months’ leave. Neither has he been summoned by the committee probing the allegations,” he told a news conference.
Mr. Herath said his party was displeased over the slow progress of investigation into LTTE’s former arms procurer Kumaran Pathmanathan alias KP and those who were alleged to have committed several acts of bribery and corruption. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
