Several countries including US and UK have expressed their concerns over the decision taken by President Maithripala Sirisena to dissolve Parliament on November 9, days before it was due to be reconvened.

“President Maithripala Sirisena's decision to dissolve Parliament poses a vital threat to Sri Lanka's democratic institutions. There is much at state and such actions jeopardize Sri Lanka's economic progress and international reputation. We call on the President to respect his country's democratic tradition and the rule of law, and to fulfill the commitments to good governance and democracy upon which he and his government were elected,” the United States said.

The European Union said that the decision of President Sirisena to dissolve the Sri Lankan Parliament ahead of its planned reconvening risks undermining public confidence in the country’s democratic institutions and processes and further deepens the political and economic crisis in the country. 
“A fully functioning Parliament is an essential pillar of democracy. As a longstanding supporter of a democratic Sri Lanka, the European Union expects a swift and peaceful resolution of the current crisis, in line with the Sri Lankan Constitution,” the EU said.

Meanwhile, issuing a statement Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs Marise Payne said Australia expressing its concern and disappointment with President Sirisena’s decision to dissolve the Sri Lankan parliament on 9 November.

“As a longstanding friend, we believe this action undermines Sri Lanka’s long democratic tradition and poses a risk to its stability and prosperity. We urge respect for the country’s democratic institutions and for all parties to continue to exercise restraint,” she said.

The UK Minister of State for Asia and the Pacific Mark Field also stated that he was concerned about the latest development in Sri Lanka.
 
“As a friend of Sri Lanka, the UK calls on all parties to uphold the constitution and respect democratic institutions and processes,” he said.

Issuing a statement, Norway also said that it is deeply concerned by President Sirisena’s decision to dissolve the Sri Lankan parliament on November 9th, just days before it was due to be reconvened. “As a longstanding friend, Norway believes this action undermines Sri Lanka’s long democratic tradition and poses a risk to stability, prosperity, reconciliation and accountability. Norway calls on all parties to respect democratic institutions and continue to exercise restraint,” it added.

Switzerland also deplored the political crisis in Sri Lanka and the recent decision to dissolve Sri Lanka’s Parliament. It calls on all parties to follow democratic processes and to respect the rule of law.
“Switzerland is deeply concerned by the increasing political crisis in Sri Lanka and the recent decision to dissolve Sri Lanka’s Parliament. Switzerland considers that this decision threatens the stability of Sri Lanka, may have adverse effects on its economic prosperity, its democratic future and the ongoing reconciliation process supported by Switzerland in the past years. Switzerland calls upon all parties to revert to the rule of law and to the principles of good governance. It requests all actors to exercise restraint and calls upon President Sirisena to settle the current crisis as quickly as possible while respecting the country’s democratic institutions and processes.”
