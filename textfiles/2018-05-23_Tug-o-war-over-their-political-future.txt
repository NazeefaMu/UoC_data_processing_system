Tug-o-war over their political future


	



 

A few politicos of the Group of 16 that crossed over to the opposition recently are said to be embroiled in a polemical row.

 


The group’s majority reportedly holds the view that they should team up with the JO instead of keeping one leg in the government and other in the opposition. 


However, two gabby ones, one from the central hills and the other from Uva are adamant that they should continue to hold on to the Blue identity despite being in the opposition and one or two others including an offspring of a governing one are standing by 
the duo.


Meanwhile, some of them have taken exception to the statement made by John the Silent from the Gem City about the next party leader.


Notwithstanding the ongoing row, the loyalists of the former strongman within the group who are keen on teaming up with the Pohottuwa may have the last laugh, they say.
