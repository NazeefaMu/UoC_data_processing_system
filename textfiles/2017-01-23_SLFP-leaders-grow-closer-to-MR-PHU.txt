Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) Leaders grow closer to its patron and former president Mahinda Rajapaksa when an election is approaching, the Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) said today.

PHU General Secretary MP Udaya Gammanpila said these leaders know that they would lose the election if Mr. Rajapaksa was not there by their side on the election stage.

“SLFP leaders try to get Mr. Rajapaksa on to their stage by working their charm on him. However, as usual, they will blame and shame him once the election is over,” he told a news conference. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
