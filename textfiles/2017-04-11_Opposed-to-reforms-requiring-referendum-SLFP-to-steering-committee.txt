The Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) has informed the Steering Committee working on constitutional proposals that it was only supportive of constitutional reforms which does not require the approval by the people at a referendum.

SLFP front-liner and Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva informed the committee of the stance taken by the party and stressed the need to prioritize electoral reforms.

He said the SLFP was open for discussions on the concurrent list of subjects jointly handled by the central government and the provincial councils and that the unitary nature of the present constitution should not be compromised. (Kelum Bandara)
