Major General Sudantha Ranasinghe said today search operations in Aranayake would continue and rejected reports that the operations had been stopped.

“We have reduced the number of troops but we are still continuing our operations,” he said.

Meanwhile, he said religious observances including a Sanghika Daana would be held on June 2 at 8.30 am at a school building near the landslide site to invoke blessings on the dead.
