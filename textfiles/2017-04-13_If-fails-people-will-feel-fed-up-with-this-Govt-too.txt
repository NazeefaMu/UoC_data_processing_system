Issues of Sri Lankan Tamils need quick solutions but if the government fails in giving solutions, the people will feel fed up with this government as well, Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan has said in Vavuniya on Wednesday. 

According to PTI, he has said Tamils in Sri Lanka had anticipated a change for the better with President Maithripala Sirisena’s election two years ago, but they are yet to receive solutions to their problems.

"We see a difference in the current government from the past one on their policies, statements and standings, but our people are yet to receive solutions to their problems. It has been over two years since this government came," he said addressing a ceremony to handover houses to people displaced due to the LTTE conflict.
