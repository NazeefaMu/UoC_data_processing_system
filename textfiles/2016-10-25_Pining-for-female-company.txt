A senior Minister well past his sixties, representing a constituency North of Colombo has openly confessed his unhappiness over the unavailability of two female members on either side of his seat in Parliament. 

 

He has said that if there are two fair members next to him on either side, it would buoy up his spirits. The Minister has said that if there is at least one fair member seated by his side wafting a sweet fragrance it would keep him in good cheer for the whole day.
