More than 3,400 British bombs have been dropped on ISIS targets in Iraq and Syria, a new analysis of the war reveals today.  


The Ministry of Defence claims to have caused no civilian casualties with the air campaign which began with strikes in northern Iraq in 2014.  


The Royal Air Force has flown more than 8,000 sorties since the air war began while a coalition of local forces takes the fight to terrorists on the grounds.  
Britain joined an international coalition against the group after it swept into Northern Iraq and Syria to seize territory amid the chaos of the Syrian civil war.  


Analysis by the i newspaper that up to September this year, UK forces dropped at least 3,482 bombs and missiles in the battle against ISIS, including 2,089 Paveway IV smart bombs and 486 of the more accurate Brimstone missiles dropped by Typhoon and Tornado jets.  
RAF Reaper drones have also fired 724 Hellfire missiles at 
ISIS targets.  




The Government describes the Brimstone as the most accurate weapon available that can be fired by aircraft, and they are conservatively estimated to cost £100,000 each.An MoD spokesperson said: ‘We have no evidence that RAF strikes have caused civilian casualties.  The claim of no civilian casualties is disputed by Airwars, a campaign group monitoring the impact of coalition air strikes.  
It warned the RAF’s claim was based on observation from the air and not eyewitness accounts on the ground.   


Samuel Oakford, an analyst for Airwars, told i: ‘Given evidence that non-American Coalition members are responsible for civilian deaths, it is incumbent on countries as active in the campaign as the UK to be transparent about what happens after they drop bombs in Iraq 
and Syria.’
