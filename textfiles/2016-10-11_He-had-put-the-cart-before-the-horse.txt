He had put the cart before the horse!


	



 

Some structural parts of a section of this building complex housing a Ministry related to sea activity were demolished some time ago to make way for building a set of new cubicles under a restructuring plan.

 


However, the work under the restructuring plan has failed to kick off for want of funds for the purpose and this has crippled the functioning of several divisions of the Ministry which had to be moved out to make way for the proposed renovation work. Important files maintained at the displaced divisions are lying in scattered all over the place gathering dust, they say.


A certain white collar high-up transferred by way of a ‘good riddance of bad rubbish’ measure to this Ministry from another Ministry that represents a blind-folded lady holding the scales even had launched the restructuring project without getting the necessary financial provisions allocated in advance for the purpose, they say.
