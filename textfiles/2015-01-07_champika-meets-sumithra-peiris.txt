JHU General Secretary Patali Champika Ranawaka has met Sumithra Peiris this morning and explained that the confusion over photos of Lester James Peiris and KP was unintentional, JHU sources said.
While apologizing for the ‘inadvertent error’ Mr. Ranawaka has explained that confusion had taken place due to availability of two photos, one issued by government information department regarding a totally unrelated incident, on the same page.
The ex-minister has said he had mistaken the cropped up photo too as one issued by the government itself some time back.
