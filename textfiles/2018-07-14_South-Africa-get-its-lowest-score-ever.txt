The Proteas were once again undone by the spin with Perera taking 6 wickets and Herath cleaning up the rest. Lakshan Sandakan took the final wicket of Tabraiz Shamsi as South Africa were bowled out for 73. Sri Lanka win the first Test by 279 runs to take a 1-0 lead in the 2-match Test series.

South Africa were all out for 73 in their second innings, the worst for them in Sri Lanka. They were bundled out for 126 in the first innings on Friday, their previous lowest total in the island nation.

Perera followed up his first-innings figures of 4-46 with six for 32 in the second, his best bowling figures in tests, with veteran left-arm spinner Rangana Herath picking up three.
