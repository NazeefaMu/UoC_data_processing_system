Blue party’s local politicos loyal to the former strongman have begun regrouping with the upcoming local government polls in sight.
The livewire behind the regrouping of these local politicos is a family member who is widely looked on as the main cause for the former strongman’s downfall.   The key figures of the joint opposition who had been faithful companions of the former strongman on his political journey so far, are said to be highly upset over the family member’s comeback to the scene to direct the former strongman’s political destiny. 
The joint opposition bigwigs say that they stood by the former strongman at his darkest hour and now this family member who is not popular among his own kith and kin has come back to sideline them and send  their political plans haywire. 
They also have warned that the simmering anger among the Blue party men at the family member’s self-appointed role as the new party organizer will soon reach boiling point and therefore, the former strongman should lose no time in showing him the door.
