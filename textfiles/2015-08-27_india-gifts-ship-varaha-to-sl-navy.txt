Former Indian Coast Guard Ship Varaha, which had been in service with Sri Lanka Navy as Naval Ship ‘Sagara’ since 2006, was today ceremonially handed over to Sri Lanka Navy by Indian High Commissioner to Sri Lanka, Y. K. Sinha at Colombo port.
Defence Ministry Secretary B. M. U. D. Basnayake accepted the ship on behalf of the Government of Sri Lanka.
Commander of the Sri Lanka Navy, Vice Admiral Ravindra Wijegunaratne welcomed High Commissioner Sinha, Chief of Defence Staff Kolitha Gunatilleke and the other distinguished invitees onboard Sagara.
SLNS Sagara is an Offshore Patrol Vessel made by India in 1992. The ship, which is 75m in length and 11m in width, was provided by the Indian Government on a free dry lease agreement to the Sri Lanka Navy in 2006 in appreciation of the Sri Lanka Navy’s efforts to maintain the maritime security in the region.
SLNS Sagara served the Sri Lanka Navy in many successful operations conducted during the conflict period. It has contributed immensely for surveillance activities since 2009 to date.
