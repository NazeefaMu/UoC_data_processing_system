Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said today the new Standing Orders which will be effective by April 15 compels ministers to answer questions in Parliament and asking for extra time would be limited under the new SOs.

The Speaker said this when MP Asoka Priyantha complained that his question was not answered by subject Minister Mahinda Amaraweera, who was not in Parliament at the time.

“I am not finding fault with the minister but I only stress the need for ministers to answer questions raised by new MPs,” he said. (Yohan Perera)
