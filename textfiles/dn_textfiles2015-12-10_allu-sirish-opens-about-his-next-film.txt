Allu Sirish opens up about his NEXT FILM

Allu Sirish claims this film will be a game changer.
An actor, who hasn’t had a film release in over a year, says he has invested a lot of time on his next project, which is currently on the floors. He believes it will be a game changer for his career. “This gap gave me an opportunity to learn a lot and understand what I want to do with my career. It opened some new doors and helped me to see things from a different perspective,” Sirish told a news portal, adding that the time taken for his next project is totally worth it. The yet-untitled film, which is currently on floors, is being directed by Parasuram. ”This is a big film. I’m sure that it will be a game changer for my career. This is the kind of film that will bring scores of families to the cinemas again. I’ve worked so far only in love stories but this is a family drama,” he said. Explaining about his character in detail, Sirish said: “I couldn’t get the pulse of all the characters that I’ve played so far. However, the character in this film is very close to my inner self and that got me excited. I could easily relate to it. ”I like to do films that help me get in touch with some part of me.”
While Sirish is spending ample time on a project, his brother Allu Arjun has had four releases in the last two years. ”If I really push myself, I can easily do two films a year. But I don’t see the need to hurry and end up doing bad projects. I don’t like to ape my brother and do things exactly the way he does. Each film is like raising a child and this process can’t be rushed,” he said.
Before the project went on floors, Sirish spent quality time in the gym. He says it wasn’t in preparation for his role in the film. ”I had to undergo a knee surgery after the release of my last film. In order to get back in shape, I started working out and I loved the transformation. Fitness has now become a way of life,” he said.
Also starring Lavanya Tripathi, nearly 50 percent of the film has already been completed. ”We are planning to release it in February or March next year. Even if it gets delayed, we’re fine because we don’t want to hurry,” Sirish, who is still keen to explore opportunities in Tamil. He made his acting debut in 2013 Tamil-Telugu bilingual Gouravam.
