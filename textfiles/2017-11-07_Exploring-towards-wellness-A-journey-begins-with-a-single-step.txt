The conference will also address the novel approaches in healthcare industry including genomics, personalized medicine, and nano drug delivering.   


The trade fair will showcase 120 stalls distributed among international and national business community engaged in the fields related to traditional/herbal medicine, nutraceuticals and functional foods. Further, the trade fair will facilitate Business to Business [B2B] and Business to Academic [B2A] interactions providing a common platform to discuss, communicate on Private-Public Partnerships [PPP]leading to novel product development through cutting edge research linking industry and academia.   
Interestingly, Sri Lanka has a unique biota of plants of which 12% is endemic to the country. Many of these plants are being used as raw materials for various concoctions and drug preparations in TM of Sri Lanka. However, less than 1% of these plants have been evaluated scientifically for their medicinal properties and few have reached to the product development stage. 


TradMed International highlights timely requirement to tap into this goldmine opening pathway to novel product development through value addition.
