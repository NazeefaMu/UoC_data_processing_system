Sri Lanka reinstated full ICC membership

 
Following last month's elections, Sri Lanka Cricket's membership of the ICC has been reinstated in full, states an ICC media release following a Board meeting held in Dubai.
"SLC is now entitled to full funding and attendance and voting rights at the Board and Full Council," the release stated.
The SLC had been stripped of its voting rights at the ICC table in April last year and given only observer status, when the ICC took a dim view of a government appointed interim committee in Sri Lanka. The interim committee was dissolved and elections held early in January.
Sri Lanka was represented at the Board meeting by vice president Jayantha Dharmadasa.
