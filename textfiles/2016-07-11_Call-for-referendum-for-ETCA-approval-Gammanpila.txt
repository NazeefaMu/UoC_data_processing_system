Call for referendum for ETCA approval - Gammanpila


	

Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) General Secretary MP Udaya Gammanpila  today challenged the Government to call for a referendum in order to seek public approval for the Economic and Technology Cooperation Agreement (ECTA).


Addressing a media briefing, MP Gammanpila said they would not agree on the ECTA if the Government is unable to seek public approval for the ECTA through a referendum. He also said signing such agreements would completely devastate the country’s independence.


“There is a saying in English literature that ‘Do not catch anything that you cannot throw away’. This saying is applicable to the Governments’ current situation. If Sri Lanka would sign an agreement with a huge country like India, our country would never be able to get rid of them in any circumstance,” he added. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)
