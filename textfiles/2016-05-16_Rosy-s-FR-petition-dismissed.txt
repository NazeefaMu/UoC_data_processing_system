Rosy's FR petition dismissed


	

The Supreme Court today refused to grant leave to proceed with the rights petition filed Rosy Senanayake seeking a recount of preference votes polled in the Colombo District at last year's general election.

The Bench comprised Chief Justice K.Sripavan and Justice Upali Abeyratne.

The petitioner sought recounting of preference votes particularly secured by her, Hirunika Premachandra and Mano Ganeshan.

The Elections Commissioner, Colombo District Returning Offer, the Attorney General and 22 others were cited by her as respondents.

The petitioner said the votes she had polled at some of the polling divisions and the votes secured by some of the other candidates had been arbitrarily, illegally and unlawfully altered by the election officials when entering them into the computer system.

She said the Elections Commissioner’s office had not issued passes to enabling counting agents of the party to be present in the computer room at the time the written statements were being processed and entered into the computer system.

Ms. Senanayake said she was unaware of the irregularities taking place in the computer room and as such was unable to exercise her rights as a candidate to request a re-count of the preference votes.(SS Selvanayagam)
