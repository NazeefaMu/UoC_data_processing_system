London, (Daily Mail), 10 July 2017 - Seventy firefighters are battling a huge blaze at London’s famous Camden Lock Market with terrified witnesses fearing the building would explode at any moment.   


Giant smoke clouds could be seen for miles across the capital and 10 fire engines rushed to tackle the blaze just before midnight on Sunday.  


The fire service said it is too early to say where the fire started or whether anyone has been injured.  
However witnesses say they believe the fire started at Gilgamesh - an upmarket Indian restaurant based inside the huge market hall, home to 1,000 businesses.   


Part of Camden High Street was blocked off while crews battled to get the fire under control with members of the public are urged to stay clear of the area.
