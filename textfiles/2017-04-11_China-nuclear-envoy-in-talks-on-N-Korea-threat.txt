China’s top nuclear envoy arrived in Seoul Monday for talks on the North Korean threat, as a US naval strike group headed to the region in a show of force.   


President Donald Trump, fresh from a missile strike on Syria that was widely interpreted as putting Pyongyang on warning, has asked to be provided with a range of options for eliminating the North’s nuclear capabilities.   


 “Presidents before and President Trump agreed that that is unacceptable, that what must happen is the denuclearisation of the peninsula,” US National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster told Fox News on Sunday.   


Speculation of an imminent nuclear test is brewing as the North marks major anniversaries this month including the 105th birthday of its founding leader -- usually celebrated with a demonstration of military might.
