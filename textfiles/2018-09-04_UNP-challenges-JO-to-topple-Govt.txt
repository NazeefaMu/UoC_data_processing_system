UNP challenges JO to topple Govt.


	

While saying that the Government was neither scared nor interested in the JO protest scheduled to be held tomorrow, Law & Order Deputy Minister Nalin Bandara challenged JO members to topple the Government.

Addressing a news briefing, he said that the JO members had emphasized on several occasions that they would topple the Government by means of this protest campaign.

“They boast saying that a large crowd will accompany them in the endeavour to topple the Government. People are not that much stupid to join hands with them,” the Deputy Minister said.

“This is not the first time that these JO members are marching to Colombo. There have been protest marches prior to this one and none of them produced good results. Likewise, this also would become a dead duck,” he added.     

  He said that although there was an allegation that the Government attempted to sabotage the protest, it had no such intention.  (Sheain Fernandopulle)
