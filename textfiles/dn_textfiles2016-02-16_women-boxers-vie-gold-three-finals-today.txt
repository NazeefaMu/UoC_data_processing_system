Women boxers vie for gold in three finals today

Sri Lanka shooters bagged four silver and eight bronze medals at the 2016 South Asian Games worked off at Guwahati Kalipara Firing Range yesterday. This achievement is a significant improvement when compared to the 2010 Dhaka SAG where they won only two bronze medals.
Damith Krishantha of Sri Lanka Navy created a new Sri Lankan record in the 50m Rifle Triple Action Shooting with a performance of 1149 points. The Men’s and women's teams also won the silver in the 50m Rifle Triple Action event.
Sri Lankan pugilists added two silver medals to the overall medals tally when the boxing events were worked off at the Sai-sag Centre in Shillong. Ruwan Thilina Weerakkody (56kg) and Dinidu Dasun (64kg) had to settle for the silver when they were both defeated by their Indian opponents in the finals.
Boxers Gayan Sanjeewa (60kg), Ishan Ranjeewa Seneviratne (52kg), Thiwanka Sandaruwan (49kg) and Sisira Kumara (69kg) secured bronze medals in their respective weight categories. Sandaruwan who fought hard against his Indian rival was deprived of silver by a poor referee’s decision.
Sri Lanka women boxers participating for the first time in SAG will be featured in three finals today at the Sai-sag centre. Anusha Kodituwakku (51kg), Vidhushika Prabhashika (60kg) and Nilanthi Arachchige (75kg) are in high spirits to bring honour to the country.
Judo contests began yesterday and the finals will be held today at Shillong. Six Lankan men and six women judokas will be seen in action during the contests. The Taekwondo competitions concluded yesterday and Sri Lanka had to be satisfied with one silver and four bronze medals. Altogether 13 Lankans competed in the Taekwondo events and Piyum Sanjeewa (over 87kg) won the solitary silver. Sri Lanka also won three men's category bronze medals and one women's bronze in taekwondo. "Our performance was not up to expectations. We won one gold, one silver and four bronze medals at the 11th SAG. We hoped to bring more medals this time, but had to compete with tough Afghanistan opponents who were of Olympic standard," said the team manager.
