Opposition Leader Nimal Siripala de Silva, in an emotional speech asked those agitating for his removal to do so if they wished to. He said he would respect any ruling by the Speaker in this regard.
He made this remark during various points of view raised in the House over the post of opposition leader.
Mr. De Silva said a group of MPs developed the argument that he as an MP from the United People's Freedom Alliance (UPFA) could not cling on to the post because the party had become part of the government.
“If I cannot hold the post as a member of the UPFA, then no other MP from the UPFA can also stake a claim for it," he said.
His remarks were received with applause by government members while opposition MPs, pressing for a replacement responded with sarcasm. (Kelum Bandara and Yohan Perera)
