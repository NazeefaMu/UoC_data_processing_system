The first two customers to pre order the eagerly-awaited Samsung Galaxy S9 and S9+ - Mr.W A W Bandara and Mr. S R S Asmeer - were felicitated by Samsung Sri Lanka and Dialog Axiata PLC at the Dialog Iconic Showroom. They are all set to enjoy the delightful features of the new model, such as the advanced camera, innovative low light camera, super slow-mo video capabilities and personalized AR emoji features. Samsung and Dialog, two market leaders in their respective areas of business, have combined their synergies to extend this irresistible offer to customers who can now fulfil their dream of owning their very own Samsung S9 and S9+!

The S9‘s AR Emoji is capturing users’ hearts the world over and they can’t get enough of having their own digital avatar expressing their candid feelings! The quirky GIFs too are fast becoming a favourite amongst S9 fans. S9 and S9+ have re-imagined the way people communicate, personalizing their expressions and making it easy to share their feelings with their loved ones. 

The low light camera is proving to be ideal for capturing romantic and soulful images, resulting in real clarity. The Galaxy S9’s rear camera and the primary sensor in the dual camera setup of S9+ feature 12-megpixel lens with variable aperture of f/1.5 to f/2.4. The lens is also equipped with Optical Image Stabilization (OIS) and dual pixel autofocus. The presence of variable aperture makes it possible to snap amazing shots in low-light conditions as well as well-lit scenarios.  

What’s more, users are having a whale of a time playing around with the Super Slow-mo video capabilities to freeze and slow down their favourite moments, resulting in some memorable memories. S9 fans believe the models are designed to boost people’s lifestyle and social aspirations! Customers are loving the enhanced speaker sound, making it easy to video chat and listen to music.
