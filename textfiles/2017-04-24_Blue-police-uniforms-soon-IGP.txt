Khaki police uniforms worn by police personnel will soon be replaced by blue uniforms, IGP Pujith Jayasundara said yesterday.

Speaking at an event in Ella, Jayasundara said most police departments in the world had blue uniforms.

“We thought the department needed a change so we decided to change our uniforms to a dark blue. We will implement this soon,” he said.  

Jayasundara said he hoped the change would push the police department in a new direction.(Darshana Sanjeewa)
