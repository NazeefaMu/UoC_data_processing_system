President Maithripala Sirisena today pledged he would never leave room for the international community, any other country or group to raise issues regarding Sri Lanka’s fundamental rights, human rights, democracy or give them any excuse to interfere in the internal affairs of the country.
“I will fulfil all my pledges in restoring and safeguardingthe human rights and the fundamental rights of our people and lead the country on a victorious path while protecting its unitary character,” the President said the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) May Day rally which was the first public rally he addressed after being elected as party Chairman and Sri Lanka’s new President.
He said the rights of the working class will be safeguarded under his administration and said everyone should be responsible to protect Sri Lanka’s freedom, integrity and peace.
“We must work together regardless of political differences. The SLFP had placed its faith in me by appointing me as the party chairman while the people had placed their faith in me by electing me as the president of the country. I will treat all people on an equal footing and vow not to promote discrimination or give special treatment. I consider all citizens as Sri Lankans whatever their political party affiliations are,” the President said.
He said he was able to secure the livelihood opportunities of several SLFPers who were sacked from the Board of Investment (BOI) and the Road Development Authority (RDA).
“I was able to do this as SLFP Chairman and the President of the Country. I will only use my powers to protect our citizens,” he said.  
Commenting on reports that he was taking action based on the advice he received from others, the President said no one other than the people who will be allowed to control him.
Meanwhile, he said the 19th Amendment to the Constitution would provide more space for freedom of expression make the President answerable to parliament restricting his power to take arbitrary action.
The President said he met SLFP leaders and activists in several districts during the past few weeks and that he would meet the rest of the SLFP leaders soon.
“As members of the SLFP we should join all who love this country and with the support of trade union members and intellectuals help transform the country into a newly developed nation,” he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
