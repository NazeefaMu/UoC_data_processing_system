So finally Angie borrowed from Kate?

The By the Sea red carpet circuit is in full swing for Angelina Jolie, who appeared with Brad Pitt for the film's premiere in New York City last week. Angie, wearer of thigh-high slits and sleek suits, went for a more modest, classic outfit: a vintage pale blue dress with beige heels. The look was nearly the same as the one Kate Middleton wore for her recent red carpet appearance, down to the silver belt.
Brad was a little dressed down to be Prince William, but perhaps he didn't want to take any attention away from his wife. That gaze is Ryan Reynolds-Blake Lively level.
