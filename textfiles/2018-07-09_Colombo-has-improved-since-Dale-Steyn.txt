South African Bowler Dale Steyn, who is in Sri Lanka for the upcoming cricket matches, said he was ‘super impressed’ with Colombo and said the condition of the city had improved since his last visit in 2006.

“Streets are clean, roads are good and parks are well looked after. Great to see a massive difference compared with 2006 when I first toured here,” he tweeted.
