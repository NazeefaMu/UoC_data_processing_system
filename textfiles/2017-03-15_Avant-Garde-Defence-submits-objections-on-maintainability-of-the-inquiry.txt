Avant Garde: Defence submits objections on maintainability of the inquiry


	

The defence counsel today submitted their written objections to the maintainability of the inquiry in the Avant-Garde Maritime Security Services case in which former defence secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa, Nisanka Senadhipathi and six others are charges with corruption by the Bribery Commission.

The Bribery Commission had informed court that the suspects had committed an offence by permitting the Avant Garde Maritime Services to operate a floating armoury and thereby incurring a loss of Rs.11.4 billion to the state.

The other six suspects are Sujatha Damayanthi, Palitha Piyasiri Fernando, Karunaratne Bandara Adhikarai, Somathilaka Dissanayake, Jayanath Sirikumara Colambage and Jayantha Perera.

Subsequently, Colombo Chief Magistrate Lal RanasingheBandara directed the prosecution to submit their counter objections on this matter within two weeks. (Shehan Chamika Silva)
