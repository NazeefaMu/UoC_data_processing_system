The deans of eight medical faculties are to meet today (28) at the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) to explore the feasibility of transferring the ownership of the South Asia Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) to Sri Lanka Institute of Information Technology (SLIIT) based on the restructuring module recommended by the five-member Presidential Committee chaired by Deputy Minister Harsha de Silva, reliable sources said.

Dean of the Medical Faculty of the University of Kelaniya, Professor Nilanthi de Silva in a letter sent to medical students last week had asked them to attend lectures again, saying that the SAITM issue would be settled in a positive manner soon, the Daily Mirror learns.

In the letter dated September 19 she had hinted that the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) would be taken over by another entity which she had said "would most probably be SLIIT".

“SAITM will be taken over by another entity (most probably SLIIT) and when it is done within 2-3 months, SAITM will cease to exist and there will be no further admissions (i.e- it will be abolished),” it said.

It had also stated the government had repeatedly maintained that its national policy was to permit private education and according to the policy a non-profit institution like SLIIT, which already has a reputation of offering high quality degrees is a better alternative than the SAITM.

Moreover, it said when the SLIIT or any other entity takes over the MBBS degree programme it would have to obtain fresh approvals in order to adhere to the minimum standards specified for medical education institutions in the country.

Also it had requested the medical students to attend a discussion to be held in Kelaniya University faculty auditorium today at 11am to discuss the demands put forward by the students to return to lectures.

However, sources close to student unions said their participation in today’s discussion was uncertain.

Meanwhile, Speaking to the Daily Mirror Deputy Minister of National Policies and Economic Affairs Dr. Harsha de Silva said last night that the Presidential Committee headed by him had called for the restructuring of the SAITM and for it to be linked to a government authority.

The Deputy Minister said he is not aware of any discussions that were taking place but it is moderate thinking. “Let them go ahead and discuss,” he added.

Meanwhile, the Executive Committee of the Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) would also meet today, reportedly to take several vital decisions over SAITM. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
