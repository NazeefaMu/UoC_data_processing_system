He gets a surprise invitation


	



 

The talkative one of the pure heritage fame had a surprise when he received an invitation to attend the recent Matara anniversary celebration.

 


The invitation card had carried a single sentence in Sinhala which said in effect: “I have the pleasure to invite you to attend the anniversary public rally to be held in Matara in appreciation of your contribution towards a new country and a new journey.”


The card had carried the signature of the Green party stalwart from Matara looking after foreign affairs. 


The pure heritage chief had tucked away the invitation card in a folder he was carrying saying that he proposed to ask the Matara Green stalwart when he met him in the council whether they really appreciated what they had said and done from the opposition benches.
