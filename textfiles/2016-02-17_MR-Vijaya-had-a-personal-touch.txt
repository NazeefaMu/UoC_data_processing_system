There was no difference between the political period of late Vijaya Kumaratunga and the present political conditions, former President and Parliamentarian Mahinda Rajapaksa said yesterday.


Addressing the 28th commemoration of the late Vijaya Kumaratunga, which was held at the New Town Hall, he said that in his opinion he could state that these types of arrests were common under the United National Party’s (UNP) regime.


He said that unfortunately, even he was connected with these as the present Government not only consisted the UNP but also the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP).
“I’m so pleased to have such an opportunity to recollect the memories of Vijaya Kumaratunga and give knowledge to the public about his era.


“Vijaya was one of my personal friends since the 70’s. He had offered me his vehicle once I was unable to go to Matara Magistrate’s Court as there was no vehicle. That day he accompanied me instead of sending a driver. Such personal memories cannot be erased,” he added.
