He says: “Probe them first”


	

This politico holding a high chair in an august assembly has got into an ugly mood after being summoned and questioned by an elite probe committee. 




The previous occupants of this high chair have been looked on as men of integrity and none of them had occasion ever to appear before this probe committee.


The present occupant of the high chair had to appear before the committee several times in the recent past and the man is livid for being made to suffer this ‘slight’.


He had vented his wrath on a committee member blaming them for being in ‘a mighty hurry’ to probe the current affairs of the control body headed by him overlooking the glaring irregularities under the previous administrations.
“You have to consider at least the dignity of the position I am holding. It’s an affront to my high office to subject me to quizzing by this committee,” the big shot had told the committee member.


The member had retorted: “We have summoned you as the head of the national body in question. The high office you are holding elsewhere is immaterial to us.”
