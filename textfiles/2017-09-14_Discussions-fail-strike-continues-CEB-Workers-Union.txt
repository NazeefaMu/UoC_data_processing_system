The Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) Workers’ Union said today that they would continue the strike indefinitely because the discussions held with the Minister and other officials this evening were unsuccessful.

Speaking to the Daily Mirror, Union Secretary Ranjan Jayalal said the discussion was held at the Ministry for about two hours.

“There was no positive outcome of the discussion and therefore we decided to go ahead with the strike until our demands were fulfilled,” he said.

The strike was launched yesterday noon by the workers demanding the immediate cancellation of the salary anomalies by revising the salary ratio between the lower level and the administrative level employees from 1:9 to 1:6. (Chaturanga Pradeep)
