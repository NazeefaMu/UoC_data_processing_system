COPE meeting in chaos?


	

A Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) meeting which was convened yesterday to get the approval for the final report was reported to be in chaos last evening.

According to one MP who is a COPE member, the meeting was going on till late last evening with no compromise reached to finalise the report. “Cope meeting is in chaos, utter chaos,” one member said in his twitter message.

According to informed sources differences of opinions on COPE’s conclusion on the bond issue had led to the dispute among the members.

Another member who did not wish to be named said some UNP members were of a different opinion on the conclusion on the bond case. The members who represented an opposition party said some UNP members were defending the former Central Bank Governor.

However another COPE member said the allegation was baseless. “What rubbish, we have no intention of defending anybody,” this member said when inquired by the Daily Mirror.

It was also reported that there might even be two reports as there were two opinions among the members of COPE on the issue. Sources said there were provisions to submit two reports by a select committee similar to the two reports submitted by the select committee which looked into the charges against one time Chief Justice Neville Samarakoon.
