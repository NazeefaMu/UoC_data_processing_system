Shangri-La’s Hambantota Resort & Spa framed by swaying coconut trees, overlooking the pristine southern coast of our beautiful Sri Lanka which spans 58.8 hectares, making it the largest resort in the country announced the launch of 'The Table by Golden Circle'. This new food and beverage loyalty programme offers unparalleled benefits to members who dine at Shangri-La properties both on the road and close to home. The dining programme is the latest initiative in the ongoing transformation of Golden Circle, which has rolled out industry-leading member benefits, new partnerships and exclusive offers. 



The programme was launched with an exclusive event that took guests on a culinary journey throughout the resort. The many visually pleasing dining locations played host to a myriad of dining experiences including canapés and cocktails on the Putting Green with a fun "shoot for shots" concept, a cheese and wine pairing at Ulpatha, the club house lounge and bar, a South Asian style hawker market at Sera restaurant, followed by a barbecue under the stars on the beach, and to conclude the culinary feast, guests were treated to desserts and live entertainment at Gimanhala lounge. 



"At Shangri-La, we offer guests a variety of culinary authenticities with a modern twist," said Iain McCormack General Manager for Shangri-La’s Hambantota Resort & Spa speaking at the launch. 



The serene atmosphere of the open air lobby adorned with local handicrafts made of natural materials, the turquoise sea view at a distance and the beautifully landscaped gardens with peacocks just strutting around makes you feel like you’ve come to another world. We had an absolutely fabulous time at the Resort experiencing all the dining areas and what 'The Table' had to offer. The quality of the food was of another level. Every dish was prepared with precision. Perfection seemed to be the theme of Executive Chef Nonky Tejapermana who stated, "Our Dine by Design experiences further add to the dining pleasure with tailormade menus highlighted by exquisite locations available around the resort, for a truly personalised and emotional experience." 



From the time of arrival we were surrounded with by warm smiles and efficient service of the staff who seemed to have got the proper essence of what is expected from the hospitality industry. The warmth that was extended to us and the hospitality we experienced was exceptional and highly commendable. What I loved most about the Resort was the fact that they had so many fun activities and so much to do. Exactly what one would expect when visiting a resort. 

The resort boasts of 300 spacious rooms, including 21 suites which offer magnificent views of either the bountiful Indian Ocean, the well-manicured golf course, the sparkling lagoon or the extensive gardens from their balconies. Comfortable bedding that you don’t want to get out of, hand-woven rugs and ocean blue panels complement the modern luxury style. The spacious bathrooms are accessories with rain showers and bathtubs. 



For recreation and activities, they have an 18 hole golf course which is one of the best in the island, pool tables, 3 exotic swimming pools, a 7m trapeze, a drone flying area, trampolines and a huge waterpark. The Hotel offers kids a range of activities at the Cool Zone Kid’s Club which includes, painting, craft designing, climbing areas, doll houses etc., and they have childcare facilities as well. Undoubtedly, this is a resort that your kids will not want to leave. 

For relaxation you can drop by the expansive Chi Ayurveda Spa and if you want to buy local handicrafts the artisan village has it all. A wide variety of dining destinations can be found throughout the resort to suit any mood. While offering a magnificent banquet hall which can easily seat 1000 or more guests, they also provide an outdoor environment to inspire destination weddings under the palms. 

This level of luxury makes time stand still while the enchantment lives on.
