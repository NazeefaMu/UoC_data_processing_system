DPA, 13th DECEMBER, 2017- One of Europe’s biggest gas distribution hubs resumed operations in Austria late Tuesday, after an explosion at the site killed one worker and disrupted the continent’s gas supply system.


“It is starting up,” a spokesman of Austrian oil and gas group OMV told dpa.


The flow of gas towards Italy, Germany and Hungary was being restored following extensive inspections by fire and police investigators, OMV subsidiary Gas Connect Austria said in a statement.
