The Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) warned today it would launch the country’s biggest ever trade union action on Friday with the backing of 160 state sector trade unions including those of teachers, nurses and the SLTB.

It said the TU action would be a protest against the government’s double standards on the SAITM issue and the attempt to destroy free education in the country.

"Six health unions including the GMOA, ten teachers' and principals' unions including the Medical Faculty Lecturers Association and five students’ unions including the Inter University Students’ Federation (IUSF) and Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) unions will join the proposed TU action, GMOA Secretary Naveen De Zoysa said.

He said more than 160 other trade unions had pledged their support to the fight against the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM).

Dr. De Zoysa said two subject ministers are working hard to destroy the health sector and free education which is the life blood of a nation.

“For the first time all state sectors work will be paralyzed by the GMOA-led fight against SAITM,” he said and criticized Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne’s May Day Speech. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
