The captain of the Government should take the responsibility when it was defeated in an election, just like the way a captain of the Sri Lankan cricket team was responsible for its defeats, Minister of Sports Dayasiri Jayasekera said today.

Minister Jayasekera said this in response to an oral question raised by MP Rohini Wijeratne in Parliament last afternoon.

Ms Wijeratne questioned as to who should be blamed for the defeat of Sri Lankan Cricket Team in recent matches.

“Is it you or the SLC Chief or is it the team, who is responsible?” the MP questioned.

The Minister then answered saying the captain has to take the blame.

“However, we managed to win some matches after the new coach took over. We can’t win every time but one must remember that team also wins games. This is the usual situation as you win and you lose” he said. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)
