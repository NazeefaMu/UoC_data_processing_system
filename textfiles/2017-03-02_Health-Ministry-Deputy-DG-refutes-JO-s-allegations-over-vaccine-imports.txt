Health Ministry Deputy DG refutes JO’s allegations over vaccine imports


	

Deputy Director General (Dental Services) of the Health Ministry Dr. J.M.W. Jayasundara Bandara today refuted all allegations levelled against the ministry by the joint opposition (JO) over the importing of vaccine ‘Taxacad’ -- known as ‘Hearticad’ in Sri Lanka -- that is given to the breast cancer patients.

Speaking to Daily Mirror, Dr. Bandara said Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne had not incurred a financial loss to the ministry as the JO claims so.

“The JO said a large-scale financial fraud took place in the tender for the importing of vaccine which is totally false. Until very recently, there was only one importer and he gave us per vial at a cost of Rs.285,000. However, we now have the opportunity to purchase a vial at a cost as low as Rs.160, 000 from a newly-registered company under the State Pharmaceuticals Corporation (SPC). Thus, after awarding the tender to the new company, the Health Ministry has been able to save up to Rs.570 million,” he said.

Dr. Jayasundara Bandara further stated that the vaccine was certified and tested by the National Drug Regulatory Authority (NDRA) and was not detrimental to cancer patients as claimed by the JO.

The joint opposition, under its ‘Top Ten Yahapalana Mega Thieves’ investigation programme, complained to the Bribery Commission on Wednesday that Health Minister Senaratne committed a crime by importing Rs.1, 500 million worth vaccines, thereby violating tender procedures and causing a huge loss to the ministry.

Responding to MP Ranjith De Zoysa’s comment that the subject minister appointed his close confidante Rumi Mohammad as the SPC Managing Director for the smooth functioning of their business, Mr. Rumi Mohammad said though Minister Senaratne was a close acquaintance of him, the minister never instructed him to engage in any wrongdoings or even interfere in tender protocols.

“The JO’s claim that the newly-formed company has a connection with my family is a false allegation. I will seek legal action against those who made false statements in a bid to tarnish my image,” he said. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
