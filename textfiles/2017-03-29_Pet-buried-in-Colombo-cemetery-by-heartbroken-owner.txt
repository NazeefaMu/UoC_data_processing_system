Pet buried in Colombo cemetery by heartbroken owner


	

A heartbreaking story of a dog owner who buried her deceased dog at a cemetery was reported from Colombo recently.

The owner, who had nowhere to bury her beloved pet as she lived in a two storey house, had resorted to pleading with an employee at a cemetery in Colombo to allocate some space for her pet which had died that day.  

The employee observing the toll of the loss on her had agreed to bury the pup for a bribe of Rs. 2,000.  
Several hours later, the pup was inconspicuously bought to the cemetery where it received an emotional funeral. Thereafter, the owner and the employee parted ways having exchanged the promised cash.
