Act of indiscretion to cost him his job!
	

A story that has gone viral in political circles these days says that a certain provincial governing one is about to get the walking papers.

According to the story, this governing one who got appointed to the same province twice had incurred the wrath of Number One for reportedly working hard behind the scene to build a bridge of understanding between the fast dwindling Blue group and theformer Madam.
After getting this information confirmed by national intelligence, Number One had rung up the governing one and told him pointblank to get ready to go home come January. The governing one, usually a talkative one, has gone into a silent mode these days, sources from the North say.

Anada Prathibha: Dancing in a circle
	
I confess, I cant dance. I know of dance and its evolution, of course. But there have been times when Ive wished that I could perform, compose, sing, play a drum or two, and dance, even at the cost of writing (which to be fair is an art in itself too). Besides, there is something ineffable and deeply mystifying about dancing. With its fusion of movement and stillness, precision and improvisation, synchronisation and autonomy, it aspires to break away from tradition while genuflecting to it.
The bedrock of traditional dance is the ves natuma, and it stems from the daha ata vannam. It was and it still remains a form of communication with the gods. Classical in the truest sense of that term, it survived colonial rule, was patronised by British officials and locals alike, and proved to be so resilient that today, it happens to be the most dominant form of dance here. The pahatha rata natuma was driven by a need to propitiate gods and demons, while the most overlooked form, the Sabaragamuwa natuma, was in part at least nourished by the other two traditions.
Evolved
With the changing times these dance forms have evolved to accommodate shifts in the cultural landscape. It has shifted to the bohemians and the radical artists of today, so much so that you come across dance items performed to, for instance, the accompaniment of rock music. Just as Martha Graham borrowed from classical ballet and transformed it to suit the mood of the Americans (who wanted a style they could call their own), our dancers, even the most conservative of them, have emphasised on the need to combine tradition with modernity. Dancing continues to flourish in the village where it belongs, to be sure, but it has come to the city as well. To a considerable extent, that has to do with the schoolchild.
The Dancing Circle of Ananda College has a history going back to 2002. It is probably not the oldest such club in the country, but it is the oldest such club in the city. Its annual showcase item, Anada Prathibha, is to unveil this Friday (December 28th) at the BMICH commencing at 5.30 p.m. I can write on the people who are organising it and on the people who are to perform at it. But that doesnt really interest me. What interests me is the way dancing has found its way to a part of the country that is at once hostile to and receptive of the past and all that it represents.
Pabasara Samodana, Secretary of the Dancing Circle, told me that both the club and event began as a response to a need to promote dancing in city schools. We unveiled a ves mangalya that year. Schools have been sponsoring the initiation ceremony for students for years, but this mangalya was different. Because of it there was an interest in traditional dance. We took advantage of that and formed a society. said Pabasara.
The first Prathibha, he tells me, was held at the Tower Hall theatre, and held as three shows: one for normal ticketholders, one for students (free of charge), and one for parents and well wishers of the performers. The reaction was apparently positive. City schools hadnt seen this kind of show. School shows in Colombo were limited to the concert and the play at the time. A show for dances, drums, and masks simply did not exist. Audiences were, given this lacuna, thrilled.
From then on Prathibha flourished: We held the second show at the Kularatne Hall. We always targeted a small venue. That was because while people were enthusiastic about it, it didnt get the massive crowds we usually got with a concert or play., said Pabasara.This year marks the 9th time Anada Prathibha will be held. The format as such has changed very little from previous installments, but this time around there will be new items. In a broad sense, each item has been catered for a specific audience.
Its a mixture of traditional and Western dancing. We will begin, as always, with a pooja natuma. This years natuma will revolve around Ravana. Then well have a medley of items performed by primary students. Then there will be a mudra natuma based on a Hindu religious folk tale thats become part of our culture. Next there will be a showcase item for our ves muhunu. Interweaving all this will be a vannama, as is always the case in a show like this. A chain of contemporary popular songs will be followed by a Karnatic dance item and a drum medley by the former president of the Circle, Chanuka Moragoda, and his drum troupe the Yaka Crew. said Pabasara.
I have two questions for these boys. Firstly, how can dance subsist at a time when belief systems are eroding among the young, and secondly, how can our dance forms flourish when only one of them, the udarata sampradaya, is taught with any kind of sustained interest
Regarding the first question, Pabasara had an interesting point to make. In the most rudimentary sense (as I pointed out before) traditional dance is an act of appeasement for the gods and an act of genuflection to the Budun-Daham-Sandun trinity. In that sense, it is both religious and cultural. In any case, Pabasara points out that no matter how sophisticated and learned he may be, the student must inculcate within himself (or herself) a sense of awe towards the divine: You cannot dance without respecting the divine, and you cannot respect the divine if you do not believe in it.
The ves mangalya is the root of the udarata natum, and it originates from the kohomba kankariya, which is patently mythical and based on legend. If you cast that aside and concentrate on the outward elements of a dance item, you will not evolve as a dancer or for that matter an artist. said Prabasara.

At least 43 killed in Kabul govt compound attack
	
KABUL AFP Dec 25, 2018 - An hours-long gun and suicide attack on a Kabul Government compound killed at least 43 people, the Health Ministry said Tuesday, making it one of the deadliest assaults on the Afghan capital this year. 
No militant group has claimed responsibility for the raid, which caps a bloody year for Afghanistan as long-suffering civilians and security forces are slaughtered in record numbers. Another 10 people were wounded in Mondays massacre on a site where the Ministry of Public Works and an office that handles pensions and benefits for war veterans are located, spokesman Waheed Majroh said. 
Gunmen stormed the compound mid-afternoon after detonating a car bomb at the entrance, sending terrified government workers running for their lives. Some jumped from windows several floors high to escape the militants. Hundreds more were trapped inside buildings for hours as heavily armed security forces swarmed the area.

Great delight brought rivalry to naught!
	

The Greens, Blues, Buds and Reds were seen in small knots excitedly talking in hushed tones in the Aluthkade complex precincts during the last few weeks.

All these political groups were present in larger numbers in the august complex precincts on the day the historic ruling on the dissolution was to be given by the seven-judge panel.
Cheers broke out soon after the court ruling was announced and the exuberant Green and red groups coming out of the courtroom were celebrating their victory in every discreet manner possible and all were flushed with excitement. In the rush, a gabby Red Diyawanna politico who came out in a run threw his arms round a Green high-up found in his path giving vent to his great delight. The Blue and Pohottuwa groups who watched this scene had started applauding.
Obviously embarrassed Red Diyawanna politico and his comrades quickly faded from the scene, they say.

HOW TO  STAY MOTIVATED
	
Take responsibility in your decisions 

e all have problems in Life. Some are temporary and others are permanent. Each one of us will have different types of problems. Let me broadly categorise those problems as Personal, Family, Financial, Physical, Mental or Social. We want happiness in this world to remain with us, but are drowned with worries and problems. In todays world only a small percentage of people are happy. Most of us enjoy happiness and sadness in equal proportions. However a few suffer throughout their lives with sorrow. At one point in life everyone undergoes a traumatic event. If the situation is not handled properly the person can become a patient because the individual becomes a victim of these problems.They are belittled by their problems. The end result is they become demotivated and inactive. They become dependent on others.
The irony is that though these people want a problem-free life no one endeavours to solve these problems.
For these people one problem becomes another problem and that creates yet another problem. It is like a chain of problems or multitude of problems. This is the saga of the meek and the weak.
Keeping these facts in mind, then I am asking you how to be motivated Having undergone tests, trials and turbulences and solved the problems on my own and become stronger, I feel it is appropriate to pen down my advice after tapping from my experiences.
Let me start with the phrase that is prescribed in the Bible, which provides confidence to the meek and the weak.  Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth. It is one of the Beatitudes from Jesus Sermon on the Mount, recorded in St Matthews gospel (Ch 5, verses 3 to 11).
Stand up in life
When you become meek and the weak you have to stand up in life. This thinking alone will provide you with inner strength. Once you possess this you will be in a position to analyse the matter meticulously.
Take down a piece of paper. Write down the problems and find out the real ones. You need to identify the Root cause of the Problem. When you do this your 50% of the problems are sorted out. Subsequently you have to write down the possible solutions and choose the best possible solution. To do this you may need the support of your family members or friends. Listen to them carefully. But heed this advice. It is you who must take the decision. It is pretty hard at times as you will have a wavering mind due to the loads of advice given. Take responsibility in your decisions and now it is the time to implement this advice. When finding solutions to your problems first, try to solve the biggest problem.
Generally, people tend to solve the easiest problem first. This stems from answering the easiest question in the exam paper during school time as a student. My advice is if you solve the toughest question first, you will automatically get the answers to the rest of the problems.
Now, my advice to be motivated throughout your life span. Keep your eyes open for  Opportunities and Challenges. Please do not try to evade problems. Face them upright. You need to hold the bull by the horns. You need to think positively. You need to be bold and courageous.
Do not resist change. Nothing is permanent except change. Hence, change with the change.

"Keep on performing your duties whether at your home, office, society or country. Believe me you will have happiness and joy in abundance by following this advice"
In the first place you must change. Remember when you do the same thing repeatedly you would get the same result.
Ideally, you must anticipate changes and prepare yourself to face them confidently.
From today onwards try to make a few changes in your daily life. To start speak to your parents, spouse, children and friends. Show them your Affection and Love.
Show them that you care for them. This will give you the Inner Peace.
As prescribed in the Bhagavat Gita, do your duties, but do not focus on the results. Keep on performing your duties whether at your home, office, society or country. Believe me you will have happiness and joy in abundance by following this advice.
We have only one life. Let us enjoy our brief stay in this materialistic world. In order to prepare ourselves for the spiritual world enjoy yourself by starting early in life. There is a myth which says that you have to enter the Spiritual Life after retirement. You do not need to wait until you become 55 or 60 years old. By that time your stamina would have reduced and you may have hearing and reading problems. So, start early in your life; may be the latter part of 30s, most preferably.
I am sure what I have presented thus far would have thrown some light on how to solve your problems if not how to find instant solutions to them. This is the main objective of this article.
I know that you will agree with me that the advice presented in this article will help you to Stay Motivated in your Life.
Yesterday was Christmas. I take this opportunity to wish the readers who celebrated this Holy Day A Merry Christmas. Let us rejoice at the birth of Infant Jesus who is the Saviour of his followers.
I also wish all readers a Happy New Year.
May the Dreams closest to your Heart come true in the upcoming New Year.
Stay Blessed.

If Cabinet increased to 45 -- Prez must seek AG's advice: SLPP
	
In case the UNP forms a national government with the SLMC so as to increase the number of Cabinet ministers to 45, then the President will have to seek the Attorney Generals opinion to consider what action to take next, the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) said today.
The SLPP said it was unethical to form a national government with the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC) which has one elected MP in an effort to increase the number of Cabinet ministers to 45.
If the UNP carries out this ploy, it will be the people who will go the courts against such a Cabinet. There is no point in having 45 ministers just for eight months, MP Lakshman Yapa Abeywardane said.
He said only the two main political parties could form a national alliance but said even that was unnecessary at this moment.
All these attempts are to please MPs who are joining the government and to retain them. We wont allow the unethical increase of the number of ministers, he said.
Meanwhile, he said it was not practical to hold the presidential election, the general election and the elections to the provincial councils on a single day.
The next presidential election will not be held until the early 2020 and as such it was too late for the PC elections, he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Investigation are being conducted on the instructions of Southern Province Senior DIG and Matara and Tangalle Divisional DIGs under the direction of the IGP.
Meanwhile, last morning the Tangalle police personnel manning a roadblock at Kudawella Junction shot at a van which had driven away despite the police signalling it to stop.
Police said in the wake of the shooting incident at Kudawella, the police had set up special security measures in the area under the directions of the IGP.(Darshana Sanjeewa)

Lo and Behold, The  Three Unwise Men..
	
Rampant borrowing was taking its toll on our fiscal stability and a One Billion Dollar Debt Interest instalment was looming, cometh January 2019.

Merry Christmas to all our readers!
It is a relief indeed that after 51 days of political jugglery, trickery and tom foolery, we are back on terra firma ; not that we are home and dry by any stretch of the imagination. Far from it; the dark, looming non prospects that have been lurking in the background in terms of a future for our sons and daughters are as ominous and bleak as ever. But one will have to concede, the hungry wolves have been beaten to the periphery, at least for now.
Normally it is after Christmas that we celebrate the coming of the Three Wisemen, the Three Kings or as some call them, the Magi, who visited infant Jesus, to adore and worship him. Yet for a change this time, for us Sri Lankans, the drama , or rather the farce, of the Three Unwise Men took stage well prior to Christmas. Yes, the Three Unwise Men, the Three idiots, the Three vicious, greedy, senile men, on whom the unfortunate men of this land has been destined to rely for their political future.
What a threesome they are! What a troika! Woe unto any land that has men as these three as their best on offer! Woe unto us who see no path without them. Woe to the political parties who can not shake off these voracious power leeches who never seem ready to let go of the reins.
Gamblers
How ready they were to gamble with the economy, stability, reputation of the country in that political chess game, adamant on checkmating each other and becoming King Had one thought that one, at least one of them, better than the other two, prior to the curtain raiser of the pantomime on 26th October 2018, well, they were sadly and badly mistaken. Werent they
To start with, the Rupee was in an abysmal downward spiral against a strengthening US Dollar. Rampant borrowing was taking its toll on our fiscal stability and a One Billion Dollar Debt Interest instalment was looming, cometh January 2019. All the promises of the 2015 January 08 change was evaporating fast in to thin air ,as the reality that the Sinhala speaking brand of thieves were now being ably substituted by English speaking ones sunk in. Yet , there was some hope; economically the target of becoming a major tourist attraction was getting a big boost with the recognition from  the Lonely Planet , as the No. 01 Spot as a tourist location. Also on the offing was a 460 million Dollar mega grant from US, a rarity for a country beyond the threshold from a poor to a lower middle income country.
Those Two
Then two of the three unwise men, got in to action and the entire political equilibrium was lost, casting the country in to unprecedented constitutional and political turmoil. Making short work of constitutional imperatives in regime change , throwing all the positives painstakingly gleaned over more than 3  years , amid many setbacks and conjuring up shadows of authoritarian, despotic, racist and divisive modes of ruling right in to the middle of democratic governance.
At that time, the third Man, who, in the eyes of the moderate onlooker had been hard done by and backstabbed badly, seemed wise. In fact , in the see-saw dynamics of power struggle that took place in terms of judicial decision, parliamentary majority as well as the cross over game that ensued, he seemed most composed; didnt budge an inch from the Temple Trees , as he had done many a time, albeit due to the persistence of his ardent followers and also did not allow his supporters to engage in a whirlwind of violence which could have ended in bloodshed. In short , he kept the tension and the suspense under a tight lid; sought legal recourse and used the civil society to the hilt putting pressure on the other two men. By that time the other two were looking really Unwise.
Well, then why do I say Three Unwise Men instead of Two , you may ask. Good point reader, but lack of incisive political vision on your part, I am afraid.
At Square One
When the thundering Verdict came from judicial heights that it was time to end the farce started by the Two Unwise or in other words, the two scoundrels, and the third man was yet again installed , in the so heatedly contested seat, he could have said, Shew, what riddance! Saved by a whisker! and seen what led to the catastrophe in the first place. What made his seat so volatile, slippery and shaky, that he had to be picked up and posted there again , only by court order He was at square one, yet again, but was it a signal to start from where he left The gradually deflating, sliding and evaporating phenomena which was at his behest, that thing called Yahapalanaya, was actually nearing a very mournful but sure death, even before the moonlight coup on October 26. He was heading for monumental election defeat even if he had continued in to 2019. His party was struggling to garner the support of even its grass root level members , let alone the floating voter. No , he was not doing well; in fact he was a disaster.
In that sense, this was a blessing in disguise; the court order and the civil society voice , made him seen in a better light. A time to have a fresh start with a clean slate. He should have said, Mea Culpa, Mea Culpa, Mea Maxima Culpa and changed his sinful ways.
And it was here, that he too showed , that he is the legitimate third member of the unholy troika, the threesome national (mis)leadership of this ill fated land. Instead of making amends by getting rid of the corrupted, accused, tarnished lackeys in his inner circle and getting the untainted and energetic ones who could make a U turn and hark back to the January 08 mandate, at least now, he is back in the old game, filling the deck with the same old rotten eggs, trying yet again the numbers game. In doing so he has already distanced himself from the genuine civil society members who stood for democracy and good governance, he has allowed his party to bleed political capital, so arduously if not somewhat fortuitously gained during the notorious 51 days, thus losing the sting the victory could have given democratic and constitutional governance.
Gifts they bring
No, he is no wise man,either; not at all. He is the legitimate, full fledged third head of the Three Unwise Men who have come to visit, nay, haunt the Sri Lankan future. They do not bring gold, frankincense and myrrh to offer us; they have lies, deception and subterfuge that they dole out lavishly to all and sundry.
As we enter the threshold of possibly an election year of momentousness, behold ,The Three Unwise Men, who hold the reins that drive us to the future.
Fingers crossed for a Wonderful New Year, any way, Dear Citizens!!

Lost the bird in hand by trying to catch the one in the bush!
	

The Blues and the Buds had come to an agreement to concede the opposition leadership to the former strongman. They, in fact, wanted to secure the opposition leadership to spite the TNA for backing the Greens in their quest to retain power.

The two groups also had decided to concede the chief opposition organizer post now being held by the Reds to the Uwe senior, a much disillusioned one for some time.
Meanwhile, a rumour said that the Uwe senior was set to throw in his lot with the Greens. The Uwe one shifted his goal post when some Blues planned to join the government.
However, Uwe Senior found himself back at zero one, when Number One stymied the move by Blues to join the government.
Now highly dejected, Uwe Senior had secretly appealed to Number One to make him the opposition leader pointing out that the former strongman was no longer a Blue.
However, Number One had immediately rejected Uwe Seniors appeal and given the green light for the former strongman to occupy the important chair.
In the ensuing confusion, Uwe Senior had lost the opposition organizer post as well to the former strongmans namesake from the South.

N. Korea blasts UN resolution on rights abuse
	

SEOUL AFP Dec 25, 2018 - North Korea on Tuesday hit back at a latest UN resolution that condemned Pyongyangs rights abuses, calling it a serious... provocation that would undermine peace efforts on the Korean peninsula. 
The UN General Assembly adopted last week a resolution -- which passed by consensus without a vote -- condemning the systematic, widespread and gross human rights violations in the isolated North. 
The impoverished but nuclear-armed nation, ruled by the Kim family through three generations, has been accused of state-sanctioned abuses including torture, rape and extrajudicial killings. 
It marked the 14th consecutive year the UN has passed such a document. The North has constantly denied any rights abuses in the country and labelled the UN criticisms as smear campaigns aimed at undermining its leadership.

Jayawardena bringing in the Executive Presidency; we, the citizens of this country, have had to contend with many abuses of this wretched POWER when it passed into the wrong hands, as it has today!!! The burning rhetoric of Dr. Colvin R. de Silvas prediction is painfully visible today when this moronic baboon cant get it into his thick skull that what he DID and what he is CONTINUING TO DO IS WRONG, DEAD WRONG!!! Who gave him the RIGHT, THE POWER TO SACK RANIL The Executive Presidency!!! Nothing penetrates the head of one who does not want to acknowledge HE IS WRONG!!! How does one describe such base ingratitude Specifically speaking, GREED is the summation of this morons idiocy!!! 
Respect cant be bought
Reading the eulogies and tributes to the late George Bush, one particular tribute from Paul Ryan, Speaker of the House, in the USA, was striking, in the present context of our country; he said and I quote: He was the first President to teach me that in a democracy sometimes you fall short and, that how you handle that is just as important as how you win.!!! I guess the sublime meaning of this, portraying how President Bush handled defeat with grace, would be totally lost on our Presidential moron!!! People earn respect in various ways and once respect is established, mostly in the case of politicians like our own, the fear of failure sets in and they will do anything it takes to keep that position!!! What they fail to realize is that respect is EARNED IT CANNOT BE BOUGHT; WHEN SUPPOSED RESPECT IS BOUGHT, VARIOUS STRATEGIES EMERGE TO KEEP THAT RESPECT AND REMAIN IN POWER!!!
Dealing with autocracy
When you have to deal with a leader who has too much power and who plays tricks to stay in power; then few dare to criticize him!!! He cannot be restrained, he does not permit the necessary checks and balances and refuses to listen to any criticism, constructive or otherwise, is shouted down, not listened to!!! Criticism, constructive or otherwise is an essential part of a healthy democracy!!! Today, we are not dealing with democracy but an autocracy!!! A dictatorial moron who should go back to the farm he came from!!! It was heartening to note from one of todays headlines RW HITS BACK AT MS (6/12 DAILY FT) that Ranil was finally hitting back!!! Why couldnt and why didnt he do it all this time Why did he allow the moron to get away with all his personal attacks 
Mental cases
Congratulations to Sarath Fonseka for his brilliant realization that most of the nuts we have in Parliament are MENTAL CASES!!! What we desperately need NOW is NEW BLOOD, NEW IDEAS, YOUNG MINISTERS who are capable of facing whatever is dealt out to them and CARRYING IT WITHOUT FEAR TO A SATISFACTORY CONCLUSION FOR THE COUNTRY!!! All the ancient relics who are now incapable, inconclusive, incompetent, taking up valuable space of Parliament must, for the sake of the country, go back home where they belong and leave the YOUNG ONES, THE NEW GENERATION TO SHOW WHAT THEY CAN DO FOR THE COUNTRY, STARTING WITH ABOLISHING THE EXECUTIVE PRESIDENCY!!! The Parliamentarians we have now are an incompetent, spent force, damp squibs or as they say in Sinhala PUSSWEDILLAS they dont want to go with dignity, all they want to do is hang on when they cant even make their presence felt!!! Most of the young ones we have are sons of brilliant politicians who left their mark on the history of this country and these young men will be proud to uphold the dignity of Parliament and carry on the legacy their fathers inculcated in them!!! COUNTRY FIRST!!! TO MAKE VALUABLE CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE COUNTRY!!! AFTER 70 YEARS OF FREEDOM, THIS IS THE FIRST TIME IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY THAT SUCH MADNESS HAS TAKEN PLACE AND WE ARE LEFT WITHOUT A GOVERNMENT!!! THEY ARE WASTING MONEY ON PARLIAMENTARY SITTINGS WHEN NOTHING CONCRETE OR WORTHWHILE IS GENERATED!!! TOURISM IS NON EXISTENT; A FRIEND FROM SWITZERLAND SAID ALL BOOKINGS TO SRI LANKA FOR CHRISTMAS HAVE BEEN CANCELLED!!!
Please go
Our President has threatened to go back to his VERY VISIBLE GRASS ROOTS  why doesnt he No one is stopping him, it would be a service, a boon for the country if he does go, he would be doing a huge favor for himself and the country!!! PLEASE GO!!! In a video that is going viral, our politicians have been likened to Post Turtles  while stitching a cut on the hand of a 75 year old man, the doctor struck up a conversation with the old man and eventually the topic got around to politicians and their role as our leaders!!! The old man said Well, as I see it, most politicians are Post Turtles  not being familiar with the term, the doctor asked him what a Post Turtle was  the old man said when you are driving down a country road and you come across a fence post with a turtle balanced on top , thats a Post Turtle - the old man saw the puzzled look on the Doctors face so he continued to explain You know the Turtle didnt get up there by himself, he doesnt belong up there, he doesnt know what to do while he is up there, he is elevated beyond his ability to function, and you just wonder what kind of dumb a.. put him up there to begin with!!! Best explanation of our countrys Politicians, I have ever heard!!!
No decency
It is heartening to note that some Buddhist Priests and members of the Maha Sangha have told MR categorically that they dont condone the ugly incident in Parliament and that it cannot be accepted!!! Well done!!! Ven. Ittepane Dharmalankara Thera, Mahanayake of the Kotte Parshwaya of the Kalyani Dharmasree Maha Sangha Sabha told MR We are a people who have such a great history, as such we cannot condone what happened in Parliament recently and added that the incident created a situation where we cannot go to another country and identify ourselves as Sri Lankans!!! Even then, MR has not had the decency to accept that what they did was wrong, despite the Venerable Mahanayake saying that the respect that had been earned by the Bhikkus in the past has been diminished!!! BUDDHISM AND ITS VENERABLE CUSTODIANS ARE NOT SACRED, THE COUNTRY AND ITS PEOPLE MEAN NOTHING, ARROGANCE, GREED AND AMBITION ARE ALL ENCOMPASSING!!! THEY ARE IGNORANT OF WHAT THEODORE ROOSEVELT SAID THE MOST PRACTICAL KIND OF POLITICS, IS THE POLITICS OF DECENCY  THEODORE ROOSEVELT

Ranil won the battle but could still lose the war
	
Can the UNP as it is constituted today go forwards as a progressive force of the people and for the people

There are two primary choices in life; to accept conditions as they exist, or accept the responsibility for changing them.
~Denis Waitley
After fifty long days, sanity returned to the Government quarters. The Executive ultimately blinked. The showdown on the greener patches of Colombo, the Presidential Secretariat grounds, ended in peaceful, yet a not-so-amicable settlement of swearing in of Ranil Wickremasinghe as Prime Minster again and on this occasion, for the fifth time in his long political career. That was December 16. On December 20, the new Cabinet was sworn in. When one examines the constituent members of the new Cabinet with a critical mind, the climax that was reached on December 16 was more like premature climax in an erotic sense, so to speak. The promise that was much in the air was dashed; those parliamentarians whom the critical elector wanted fired are there with more and more responsibilities and bigger Ministries. Those who failed miserably during the previous Ranil Wickremasinghes tenure as Prime Minister from August 2015 to October 2018 are back in. If the United National Partys (UNPs) leadership is not careful and sensible, an even bigger collapse seems to be in the making. The notion of being comfortable just because you beat the President at his own game is a misapprehension.
The collapse that was referred to in the previous paragraph is coming. The average constituent is becoming disenchanted by the day. The Executives behaviour from October 26, 2018 is not the beginning of this coming disaster; it certainly accelerated its pace. Yet the polarization of the country along the lines of the UNP-led coalition and the Rajapaksa-led league has confirmed that a party like the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) has no place in the mainstream of the countrys body politic. The JVPs history and its inglorious days of 87  89 have left a bitter memory of murder and mayhem. Its gory details and mindless and arbitrary execution of innocent fellow countrymen would take a long time to be erased. It would not be as easy as a deletion of data from a laptop which is an integral part of modern society.
Nothing new in the Cabinet
In such a confusing context, against such a brutally realistic backdrop, Ranil Wickremasinghe named a new Cabinet of Ministers. The only thing that is deceptively ironic is there is nothing new in that Cabinet. Decorating and rewarding failures is a cruel effecting of what should not be done. In politics, as in all other affairs of human enterprise, a long-term strategic methodology to decision-making is preferable to retail-management of daily affairs. Ancient sage, Chanakya said thus: Before you start some work, always ask yourself three questions - Why am I doing it, what the results might be and will I be successful. Only when you think deeply and find satisfactory answers to these questions, go ahead. Im sure Ranil Wickremasinghe has read Chanakyas Arthashastra, one of the original works of political science in human history, yet he does not seem to have understood the essence of Chanakyas core teachings. Repeating ones failed policies and lack of wisdom and guts to sacrifice even ones own close friends for a long-term and strategic move in favor of better and more prosperous country is a very grave mistake on the part of our Prime Minister; but he has time to rectify them, but the window of opportunity is closing fast. They say that Wickremasinghe is an enormously experienced politician, yet one wonders if Ranils experience would fit into Oscar Wildes famous quote: Experience is simply the name we give our mistakes.
Nevertheless, the time Ranil and his cabinet of Ministers have is limited only to ten short months, just ten months. In the political life of a nation, ten months is a mere winks lifetime. Can the UNP, as it is today, without a major shakeup of its fundamental structure and its leadership at all levels, with a nagging lack of daring to change its course of the political life of the country, which is looking forward to leading a nation from the brink of insane leadership at the Presidential level and given the calm or ironic docility displayed by the citizenry of the land, be successful at the next elections

	"Nevertheless, the time Ranil and his cabinet of Ministers have is limited"
	
	
	"The country is increasingly becoming disenchanted with her leaders on all sides"
	
The answer to the aforementioned question does not look to be very promising. The country is increasingly becoming disenchanted with her leaders on all sides. A voice for more stringent adherence to principles of accountability and transparency is being heard only from the JVP quarters. The alluring dynamic for a more rational and visionary politician or politicians is irresistible. Yet there seems to be none on the horizon. Nevertheless, the UNP could be that fresh face, provided it decides to choose another alternative, an alternative that which not only presents a fresh face(s) in the forthcoming elections, but also offers itself as a serious fighter against corruption and nepotism. On these new frontiers of anti-corruption, the commander-in-chief cannot be those who have been tried and tested already, nor could it spring out from amongst those who profess a rebirth of an already dead-era. Empty slogans and selfish ego trips have not taken us anywhere. The constitutional crisis that just came to a closure ironically opened many other windows into new dimensions of politicians whose hitherto hidden agendas got unconcealed.
The dilemma confronting Wickremasinghe and the UNP couldnt be clearer. The crisis brought some personalities to the notice of the conscience of the people. Some displayed remarkable strength of character by taking irrevocable steps towards the safeguard of democracy and majority rule; some showed unmistakable signs of solidarity in the face of irresistible gifts of money and ministerial postings; some young guns in the UNP itself exhibited enviable sense of discipline and strategic poise by placing the future of the Party above their selfish ambitions. Yet some failed in this crisis moment. Such men would one day be revealed for those who failed had baggage to prove such selfish and sinister motives. The social media played a decisive role, not only in exposing and running to ridicule the Executive who so richly deserved such ridicule; that specific media channel also exposed the hidden ambitions of some politicians who daydreamed about the Premiership falling on their lap; relying on the Executives unkind and crazy orders they, those unambiguously ambitious and selfish men, were rightly measured by their fellow party men and the observations made were stored away for future reference.
Can the UNP go forward
But the fundamental question remains. Can the UNP as it is constituted today go forwards as a progressive force of the people and for the people Can it be successful in future elections at which the overwhelming majority of voters are Sinhalese Buddhists Can the failed members of the Wickremasinghe Cabinet produce the desired results which they couldnt in the period of 2015 to 2018 October The voter is not all that ignorant when it comes to measuring of a political party as far as promises made and promises kept are concerned. In that harsh context, the constitution of the latest Cabinet does not emerge as auspicious.
Ranil Wickremasinghes choices are limited and there is very little time in which he could make those choices work. He could continue to dwell in his comfort zone, amongst his closest friends and head for certain disaster; or he could make some changes in his Cabinet, replace those good-for-nothing Ministers with some aggressive and forward-looking younger ones and pursue the Rajapaksas in a very authentic way and bring them before the Courts of Law. He has a third choice too. And that is keeping the same Cabinet as it is constituted today and still pursues the Rajapaksas with more aggression and urgency. In other words, Ranil Wickremasinghe has to portray himself and his Cabinet as a totally different one from the recent past; it is extremely difficult but not impossible. The second tier-leadership of the Party and its rank and file would be more than willing and able to pursue such a novel and daring line of action.

	"The constitutional crisis that just came to a closure ironically opened many other windows"
	
	
	"The voter is not all that ignorant when it comes to measuring of a political party"
	
Our county is in pain; she has suffered enough; her politicians have led this beautiful land into an ugly abyss of corruption, nepotism and political vandalism. Her children are living a nightmare which clothes itself in moving screens of television and Smart Phone. Those whose parents belong to the so-called elite and wealthy are meandering from one nightclub to another in Colombo as if they own the lands coffers and its limited wealth.
 
Change is coming and its face does not look pretty, at east as it promises now. The sad and petulant countenance could be altered and it needs to be done now, not next month, not next year and not tomorrow, it has to be done now. Ranil Wickremasinghes burden is heavy; he cannot complain nor can he place that on another. He and he alone has to carry that. That is the burden of leadership. He has to both treat that burden as his privilege and take it to its logical end of good governance. His other choice is brutal, unkind and terminal: continue in the same mode and perish. He has won a battle; yet he could still lose the war.

Reprimanded for throwing a monkey wrench into discussion!
	

A group of Green seniors had met at Temple Trees the other day to discuss a proposal to form a broad Greens-led political alliance to face the upcoming national polls.

While the deliberations were underway, a group of Diyawanna backbenchers too joined the talks.
They discussed the political parties and groupings which had expressed their willingness to enter the proposed alliance. And some of them pointed out that unprecedented number of organizations too had pledged their support to the alliance. Most of them also commented on the name already proposed for the alliance.
Presently the attention of the participants was directed to choosing a suitable symbol for the alliance. Most party seniors expressed the view that the symbol to be picked should be one of a kind that the people would easily get familiar with so that it could soon become a household word.
At this stage, a young Diyawanna member raised his voice. If you will listen to me, he said. I can suggest the most ideal symbol for our alliance!
What is it a party senior asked.
Appe! Hopper! said the young member.
The member may have expected the audience to greet his sally with a burst of laughter. But the instant reaction was just the opposite. For a moment there was a pin-drop silence. And then the member became the target of angry stares and scowls of all participants.
Later several party seniors berated the young member for trying to make fun out of a serious discussion, they say.

Size of the Cabinet - EDITORIAL
	

he current debate over the number of ministers in the Cabinet is ridiculous and ironic. It is ridiculous because it is vividly clear that the debate is not in the interest of the people of the country. It is purely a matter of satisfying various politicians by appointing them as ministers at the expense of the people. The debate is ironic because even the people are divided over the issue with one section of the tax payers wanting the Government to appoint more ministers with perks worth millions of rupees which is their hard-earned money.
While attempting to increase the number of ministers as they wish using the National Government tag, the leaders of the Government are debating whether it is 30 or 32 ministers that the Government can appoint when it is not a National Government. This points to the fact that how hell-bent are the Government leaders, who once boasted about good governance, to increase the number of ministers by at least two.
A National Government, according to the Constitution is a Government formed by the recognised political party or the independent group which obtains the highest number of seats in Parliament together with the other recognised political parties or the independent groups. But what is the need for a National Government when there is neither a national disaster or a problem such as a war or a nation-wide epidemic to be solved nor a national programme collectively prepared by political parties to be implemented
It was clear that the only need for the so-called National Government in 2015 was the need to ensure the survival of the UNF led Government which had obtained only 106 seats in the Parliament by doling out ministerial portfolios to the members of the UPFA. And now the UNF Government is mulling about a National Government just to lure the members of the other political parties in order to secure again its survival. In other words, the Government is attempting to ensure its survival by spending millions, if not billions, by way of appointing more ministers.
What is the rationale behind the appointment of any number of ministers in the name of National Government If an ordinary Government can manage the affairs of the country with 30 ministers, why cannot a National Government do the same without increasing the number of ministers
Answer is clear. MPs belonging to other parties would not join the party that has obtained the highest number of seats to form a National Government, unless they are given portfolios. Clearly it is a bribe out of public coffers. And ironically the 19th Amendment to the Constitution has provided for it. In other words, it is a constitutionally sanctioned bribe.
Now, the Government is attempting to increase the number of ministers by at least two, arguing that 30 ministers of the Cabinet should be counted excepting the President and the Prime Minister. This is a ridiculous argument since the President and the Prime Minister are members of the Cabinet. The Constitution says The total number of ministers of the Cabinet of Ministers shall not exceed thirty. Hence, there is no room for the Government to increase the number of ministers including the President and the Premier above thirty. After a bitter struggle to uphold the Constitution, it is not appropriate for the government leaders to find loopholes in the Constitution in order to increase the number of ministers.
There have been Cabinets in Sri Lanka in the past with less than twenty ministers. Even when the plantation industry was the main revenue source of the government, we did not have a separate ministry for that industry then. Despite the population having drastically increased since then, the sectors or the subjects to be handled by ministers have been remaining the same. However, after 1978 President J.R.Jayawardene while breaking up the existing ministries into three or four, appointed new ministers such as State Ministers and District Ministers, totalling over hundred ministers. Later other governments too followed it.
A recent newspaper report said that Government spends Rs. 7.5 million a month for a minister, despite the salary of a minister being not even Rs. 100,000. Hence, it is a crime to increase the number of ministers without a justifiable basis.

Torrential rain hampers rescue efforts as  death toll rises to 429
	

Search efforts for the 154 people still missing in the disaster zone of the deadly tsunami that has killed at least 429 people continued on Tuesday, with some officials admitting privately that the chance of finding more survivors alive was slim.
At the Tanjung Lesung beach resort, where the pop band Seventeen was performing when the tsunami struck, resort director Kunto Wijoyo told the Guardian he spent Sunday morning helping to carry some of the
106 bodies of people who died at the holiday retreat.
There were men, women and babies, he said, adding that he hoped authorities would consider building a dam in the area to prevent further similar disasters.
A grass lawn nearby was strewn with crumpled metal that had formed the bands stage, with half-destroyed musical instrument cases lying among the wreckage.
A policeman at the resort, large parts of which were obliterated by the waves, said rescue teams were legally obliged to keep searching for the missing people for seven days, beginning last Sunday morning.
Soldiers combed the coast, flying drones overhead as torrential rain contributed to tricky driving conditions for ambulances ferrying injured people to local hospitals.
Rescuers have also been searching Sumur, an area at the very southern part of where the tsunami hit. Officials confirmed there were 1,485 people injured by the tsunami as well as 882 houses and 73 hotels and villas damaged. More than 430 boats were also damaged.
On Monday, Indonesian officials confirmed that the deadly tsunami was triggered by a chunk of the Anak Krakatau volcano slipping into the ocean.
The volcano had been spewing ash and lava for months before a 64-hectare (158-acre) section of its south-west side collapsed, an official said.
This caused an underwater landslide and eventually caused the tsunami, said Dwikorita Karnawati, the head of the meteorological agency.
The fact that the tsunami was triggered by a volcano rather than an earthquake meant no tsunami warning was triggered, scientists said. Coastal residents reported not seeing or feeling any warning signs before waves of up tothree metres high surged in.

When the Green leader was invited to call at the main office to take oath again in the same office he lost to the former strongman under circumstances now part of history, it was Deputy Saji who took the initiative to make plans for the swearing -in ceremony in consultation with Number One.

Deputy Saji agreed with Number One that the swearing-in should be a simple ceremony and the latter requested that the Green guests at it be restricted to five persons.
However, Deputy Saji made an appeal to Number One to allow the partys party senior ones to attend the ceremony given the significance of the event.
Number One was averse to the idea at first, but as a concession to Deputy Saji, agreed to permit 18 party seniors to attend the ceremony. But he added a rider: But there are two persons who should not under any circumstances be among the 18 allowed to attend the ceremony!
On further inquiry, Deputy Saji was to learn that one of the duo under the taboo was a onetime close colleague of Number One who held the Health portfolio and the other one was a war hero whom he himself elevated to the highest military rank!

UK expresses concern at disruptive behaviour of Lankan MPs
	
UK Minister of State for Asia and the Pacific, Mark Field has informed the UK Parliament last week that they expressed concern over the behaviour of some Sri Lankan MPs disrupting parliamentary proceedings.
The State Minister said this in response to a question asked by MP Liz McInnes about the latest political developments in Sri Lanka on December 17.
The British High Commissioner to Sri Lanka met regularly with all political parties and expressed our concern at the behaviour of some MPs in disrupting parliamentary proceedings, he told the parliament on December 20.
He said following the swearing in of Ranil Wickremesinghe as Prime Minister by President Maithripala Sirisena on December 16, he made a statement welcoming progress made towards the peaceful resolution of the political impasse in Sri Lanka since October.
This outcome is a welcome indication of the resilience of Sri Lanka's judicial and democratic institutions, and of effective checks and balances between state powers. The UK will continue to stand by Sri Lanka as a close partner and friend, supporting Sri Lanka as it works to deliver sustainable and accountable reform to reinvigorate the economy, improve governance, and safeguard human rights across the country, he said.
