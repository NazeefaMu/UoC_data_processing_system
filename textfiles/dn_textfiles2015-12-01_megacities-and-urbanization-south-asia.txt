Megacities and urbanization in South Asia

This essay is prepared on behalf of the General Research Committee (GRC) of Sri Lanka Association for the Advancement of Science (SLAAS) based on an Address delivered on October 15 organized by National Academy of Sciences Sri Lanka in collaboration with the Sri Lanka Economic Association and the Institute of Town Planners Sri Lanka. Part I was published on November 30.

Theories from Spatial Economics: Growth Centre Models
Again, it is not possible to discuss these theories in detail here except to say that some are more relevant to development work in the TWCs than others. The intrusion of Economic Growth Theory took place immediately following World War II, intended to help rebuild war ravaged Europe. With this effort underway, the theory was adopted and applied to the TWCs beginning around 1951. It influenced spatial planning through several ‘growth centre’ models which became popular. These models proposed that capital investment for economic growth of a lagging region, should be made in large concentrations at a few pre-selected geographic points. The assumption was that development would then result and spread from these points.
Unfavourable scholarly reactions based on strong evidence against the Growth Centre models of the 1950s began to appear in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Consequently, an important Indian research project (Roy, Patil, 1977: 6) rejected the concept as being irrelevant to rural and regional development in India, favouring instead what was called the ‘service centre’ concept.
Theory of duality
A school of thought traceable to Boake (1953) saw a TWC's economy as being a duality consisting of: a backward, tradition-bound agriculture sector on the one hand where capitalism is not indigenous and therefore retarded; and, on the other hand, a small, urban industrial sector, where capitalism has been imported full-blown from the West. A fundamental belief behind this theory is that urbanization is essentially a beneficent process; and, that migration to cities is almost the only available process of emancipation from poverty and ignorance for rural folk in the TWCs. The roots of this belief are in the cultural alienation of Western scholars and Westernized urban elites from indigenous rural populations. This theory should not be considered with favour today.
Another set of theories from Spatial Economics which are considered in a much better light today have a lineage beginning with the work of Von Thunen (1823), which is seen now as the origin of a scientifically rigorous German school of thought.
A few other scholars have studied the relationship between the ‘rank’ and ‘size’ of towns within any country, where rank refers to hierarchical order and the size of towns is determined by the numbers of residents. These studies have a lineage starting from the work published by Jefferson in1936 and have originated in and been developed within the US. They suggest two very distinct patterns where rank and size are closely correlated in a very regular and predictable manner. In the other pattern the largest city predominates very substantially in size over the next in rank. The latter pattern is said to display ‘primacy’ and the first ranking urban place is called a ‘primate city’.
The usefulness of these studies is two-fold: it focused more light on the existence of the pattern of primacy within many TWCs; and, it suggested a causal relationship between primacy and the economic conditions residual from a history of colonial subjugation.
A Latin American scholar, Frank (1969)also sought to establish a causal link between colonialism and the condition of underdevelopment. He explained the process by which the urban configurations of most TWCs became highly skewed structures. The skewing process he attributed to the military and economic agencies of the respective colonial periods of those countries. His views are well recognized today. A UN publication states: “…many developing countries are characterized by a so-called dendritic market system, which is the legacy of a colonial past and/or of persisting international dependency relations...” (UN/ESCAP, 1979:58)
There are now many Western scholars ( starting with Johnson in 1970who have understood: that a national urban system with a skewed dendritic market structure left behind as a colonial legacy in a TWC, has little utility for national development; that market forces alone cannot be expected to alter a skewed national urban system; and, that some intervention at the national policy level is needed to free the TWC from this particular colonially derived structural constraint.
Small and mid-sized towns
A well-founded approach originated in South Asia with a Seminar in Kathmandu (1978) bearing a strong spatial content has since begun to gain much support. Thereafter two subsequent papers appeared.
In the first, the author (Rondinelli,1986) states: that colonial economic policies reinforced by post-colonial economic growth strategies of the 1950s and 1960s were major causes of the rapid growth of a few primate cities to extraordinary size in most Asian countries; that the emphasis was on developing urban industry over rural development;that the distributional effects and the spatial implications of investment allocation were largely ignored; that although the effort was to modernize the metropolitan economy, rural regions were neglected and left poor and underdeveloped; and also, that in countries with dominant primate cities, few secondary mid-sized cities could grow large enough and have sufficiently diversified economies to attract rural migrants, stimulate agricultural economies and promote regional development.
The second paper also justifies the development of small and intermediate urban places. The authors (Hardoy and Satterthwaite, 1988) have based their recommendations on reviews of over 100 empirical studies across the TWCs and a large number of national programs for small and intermediate towns. According to them, spatial programs "...can be a crucial component in attaining social and economic objectives such as increasing the…populations reached by basic services; increasing and diversifying agricultural production; and increasing the influence of citizens living in sub-national and sub-regional political and administration units...”
A UN publication (ESCAP, 1979: 87) provides some valuable observations and general conclusions for the Asia Pacific regional context. It proceeds to state: that urban-rural inequality is a major problem in the region; that the disparities in respect of services, income earning opportunities and wage rates have caused concern; that many governments in the region should pay more attention to rural development to achieve a more balanced growth spatially and between rural and urban areas and a more equitable distribution of the benefits of national development and economic growth.
Even assuming a committed approach to rural development, out-migration from rural areas for non-farm occupations may be expected to continue, though on a reduced scale. Rather than have rural migrants target the larger cities, the more manageable and preferred scenario would be where they move to the small and mid-sized towns. Then, movements to the large cities would be confined to migrants from mid-sized towns. This pattern of internal migration is sometimes referred to as “decentralized urbanization” (Sharma, 2003. 10.6, 410). It has to be noted that urban-based services in small and mid-sized towns not only require built infrastructure but also people with special skills are resident. As such skills are not readily available, a proactive planned urban settlement programme to provide these skills in S&M towns is a clear need. (Gunaratna, 2000).
Conclusions
Inter-urban configurations especially in many of the smaller TWCs were formed in response to the needs of their respective colonial economies. They are seen today as being peculiar in two ways: the predominance of a single ‘Primate City’ over all other urban places; and, the highly skewed pattern of their respective inter-urban configurations. In these respects, Sri Lanka is typical of such TWCs. Post-colonial development efforts even if effective in generating high economic growth, but are made within the framework of such colonially derived spatial structures, will benefit mainly the urban elites based in the respective Primate Cities. They will surely accentuate income inequalities across the respective countries.
Readjusting a distorted inter-urban spatial structure towards current development needs involves mainly the creation of small and mid-sized towns in carefully selected locations relevant to post-colonial development strategies. If the old inter-urban spatial structures are not re-adjusted to respond to the new development thrusts and those efforts are focused only on the respective Primate Cities, rural-urban migration will be exacerbated. Thus, already prevalent income disparities across these countries will be accentuated and the formation and consolidation of slums and shanties will inevitably result.
They will become an increasing part of the built environment of Primate Cities. Such happenings are clearly evident in most TWCs. Continued growth in this manner with mounting adverse environmental consequences can then give rise to diseconomies of scale resulting even in the flight of investments needed to drive further growth.
In the past seven decades, we in Sri Lanka have had three comprehensive plans prepared for the Colombo region. The Gal Oya project took precedence over the first. The Mahaweli project over-shadowed and pre-empted investment in the second. General Elections and a change of government intervened in the case of the third. Thus all three planning efforts were each superseded, one by one, with the passage of time.
A new plan for the Colombo region especially with political will behind it, as appears to be the case today, is most welcome. However, it has to be recognized that all megacities in the Third World have very high rural-urban migrations. They are consequently infested with massive, unhygienic slums and shanties giving rise to unmanageable social and environmental problems.
An important conclusion to be drawn is that the impact upon TWCs of the on-going globalization and popularization of scientific developments and technological innovations particularly in ICT needs to be recognized. These are surely altering the prevalent spatial landscapes of industrialization in the West. Thus, it must be expected that the spatial landscapes of most TWCs and certainly those of the South Asian countries will need to be very different from those that emerged with 19th Century industrialization and urbanization in the West.
There may be better chances of success with urbanization in Sri Lanka because we have so far been insulated to a great extent from the adverse consequences of high rural-urban migration. For this, we must thank the wisdom of our political leadership of the 1930s. The impetus they gave to irrigation and re-settlement of the dry zone, domestic food production, and, rural development through free education and preventive health care.
Despite this initial advantage, a megacity in Sri Lanka created by high rural-urban migration could still suffer the same fate unless special precautions are taken. The precautions are that planning and implementation work should to be based on best practices backed by scientific knowledge. This work should carefully avoid irrelevant concepts and theories found to be faulty. It must also be done within the ambit of an environmentally predicated national spatial policy. The latter is something that most TWCs do not have. Finally for ultimate success, it is necessary that we ourselves should deliberate, define and decide upon the national policy framework that should govern all aspects of this very special development effort.
