Russia offers air cover for anti-Assad rebels, urges polls

RUSSIA: Russia said Saturday it was ready to provide air support for Western-backed moderate rebels battling both jihadists and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad as Moscow presses on with its diplomatic offensive over the conflict.
Speaking after a surprise summit between Syria’s embattled leader and Russian President Vladimir Putin at the Kremlin this week, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov urged moves towards presidential and parliamentary polls in the war-torn country.
Representatives of Syria’s Western-backed opposition sounded incredulous, saying Russia should first stop bombing moderate rebels and that talk of elections was premature.
On the ground, Syrian troops backed by Russian air strikes battled fighters from the Islamic State (IS) group in a bid to restore a key supply line to second city Aleppo, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.
At least 28 IS fighters and 21 troops and pro-regime militia have been killed in the battle for the road leading to the government-held part of Aleppo, it said.
The monitors also reported Russian strikes in northern Hama province and said six people, including three children, were killed in what was believed to be a Russian strike on the village of Al-Barqun in Aleppo province.
Russia and the West have been at loggerheads over Assad’s fate, a major sticking point in efforts to solve a crisis that has killed more than 250,000 people since 2011 and sparked an exodus of around four million refugees.
Seeking to shake off months of Western isolation over the Ukraine conflict, Putin last month launched air strikes in Syria and has since launched negotiations with the war’s key regional players, including some of Assad’s worst enemies, such as Saudi Arabia and Turkey.
