MP Seeni Mohammed Ismail, who was sworn in as an MP yesterday had been served a charge-sheet with regard to alleged corruptive deals during his tenure at Oluvil University as the Vice Chancellor, Minister of Higher Education Dr Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe told Parliament last morning.

Dr Rajapaksa said investigations were being carried out against the new MP by the University Grants Commission.

“This MP, who was Former Vice Chancellor of Oluvil University had used the University funds to maintain his house and to pay his utility bills,” the Minister said.

“I don’t have any issue with the political party this MP belongs to but only trying showing the reality, when it comes to this country’s higher education sector,” the Minister said.

Minister Rajapakshe said a mafia was taking running the University of Oluvil as students have to give sexual bribes to lecturers to ensure that they were successful in passing examinations.

“One lecturer had threatened a student saying that he would fail him if there was no sexual bribe,” the Minister added.

The Minister said there was a peculiar environment in universities as even Vice Chancellors and Deans were pressurised not to take action against those who were caught with ragging.

He said there had been 280 reported raging incidents during the recent times, which included sexual harassments.

Dr Rajapakshe said an app had been created to help students to inform the authorities, whenever he or she was subjected to harassment in the form of ragging. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)
