The National Carrier SriLankan airlines is likely to break-even in three years,State Enterprise and Kandy Development Minister Lakshman Kiriella said during a visit to the SriLankan airlines head office yesterday.

“I have advised the new management to see that the airline's income and expenditure is on an even keel within the next three years,” he said. “People in this country have begun to focus on the national carrier and I wish to state that the government has no intention of closing down the airline. Ventures such as this should continue to serve the people."

He said the government was no longer in a position to allocate funds to boost loss-making ventures such as SriLankan on which the government spends some Rs.465 billion annually. (Yohan Perera)
