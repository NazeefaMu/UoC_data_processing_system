Being the number one bank in Sri Lanka, Bank of Ceylon (BOC) manages several funds at present and has decided to extend portfolio management service (PMS) to all clients including individuals, corporates and trust funds through its Investment Banking Division. Under this, BOC will manage the client funds and invest them in various products. BOC as the ‘Bankers to the Nation’ has the stability, strength and trust and will offer the highest level of safety and investment returns to the client. The following segment is captured from an interview had with Deputy General Manager International, Treasury and Investment Sarath Jayasuriya.
Why does an investor need a dedicated portfolio manager?
It is basically for four reasons. Firstly, a busy customer may not have enough spare time to find the best alternative for his investments. Secondly, as a premier financial institution, BOC has more access to frequently changing financial market information, which is not widely available to ordinary clients. Thirdly, the investor can have a hassle-free environment due to non-involvement in documentation. Fourthly, through proper diversification of client’s assets, the investors can earn something more than investing in traditional deposits. 
Is there any difference between your new service and investing in unit trusts? 
Yes. Unit trusts pool all the funds of investors and give the same return to all. But with BOC PMS, the investor can enjoy higher returns through a tailor-made investment mix depending on his risk appetites. The other difference is the investors are aware of where their funds were invested unlike in unit trust. 
Is there a minimum tenure for the agreement? 
The minimum tenure for the agreement should be two years. Otherwise BOC is not in a position to generate progressive return. Higher the investment and longer the tenure give the investor more opportunities to enjoy higher returns, according to his risk appetite.
How strong is your investment management team? 
Our portfolio management team consists of well-qualified and experienced fund managers. They have international exposure in our overseas branches such as London and Chennai. Also, they continuously deal with various types of investment instruments. Also, we have experienced research analysts who examine the market information.
When does an investor get his returns? 
The investment returns/income could be received at the end of the agreement or as the agreed terms at the initial discussion. 
What investment instruments are you going to offer to third party clients? 
There is a list of instruments, including government securities, treasury bills and bonds, fixed deposits, repo investments, debentures, commercial papers, unit trusts, shares and asset-backed trust certificates.
Is there any particular reason to select BOC as the portfolio manager?
Yes. BOC has the highest public trust with an over one trillion deposit base. It is the largest and strongest commercial bank in the nation with 100 percent state ownership. In addition, BOC is a leading player in treasury operations. We have experience in managing our own funds for a long time. We do various kinds of research prior to investments. Furthermore, many people have difficulties in investing their funds and have requested us to manage those. Currently, we are the only state-owned commercial bank to fulfil their requirement. Feel free to contact the following officers to begin a rewarding relationship with the BOC portfolio management service: Assistant General Manager Investment Banking M.H.S. Mala (011 2394311), Deputy Chief Dealer Rajith Thushantha (011 2203663) and Senior Manager Investments Chandima Herath (011 2448348).
