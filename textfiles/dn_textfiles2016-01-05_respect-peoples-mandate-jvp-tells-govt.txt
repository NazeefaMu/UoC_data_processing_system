Respect the people's mandate, JVP tells govt

It is abundantly clear today that the government is trying to kick the people's mandate and portray a new constitution as a panacea for all ills in the country, JVP publicity secretary, parliamentarian Vijitha Herath said.
"This is all an attempt to deceive the masses of this country," he said.
Herath expressed these sentiments addressing a press conference at the JVP headquarters at Pelawatta, Battaramulla yesterday.
He said framing of a new constitution was a timely need.
"Executive powers of the President should be totally abolished in the new constitution. But we see all this as an attempt to postpone solutions to people's problems by sweeping them under the carpet by narrowing everything to the conclusion that a new constitution would solve all burning problems," Herath said.
"Therefore, we request the government to understand the people's mandate given against political prostitution in this country and fulfil the hopes and aspirations of the people who returned it to power," he said.
"The JVP would therefore organise a massive people's protest rally at Nugegoda on January 8 to pressurise the government to honour the people's mandate given in support of good governance," Herath said.
He said all civil society organisations, intellectuals, artistes and others who were responsible to bring this government to power will join hands with the JVP to hold this rally.
Herath said the JVP requested all to participate in the rally to reverse the wrong course of action taken by the government.
