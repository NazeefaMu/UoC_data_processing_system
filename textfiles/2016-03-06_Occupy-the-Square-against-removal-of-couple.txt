‘Occupy the Square’ against removal of couple


	

A large gathering today staged a protest at the Independence Square in Colombo, against firm action taken by two security guards to evacuate a couple from the premises.

The demonstration ‘Occupy the Square’ was organized after a video of the incident was posted on social media, which showed two security officers attempting to evict a couple, stating that the Cultural Affairs Ministry ordered them to do so.

However, Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister Harsha de Silva who arrived at the protest questioned the relevant security officers of their clout in evicting the couple, and stated that a couple being seated at the premises was totally acceptable.

In response, the security guards said they resorted to urge couples to leave the premises due to nothing but mere misconduct.

The minister later posted on his Facebook page that Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe ordered the Cultural Affairs Ministry to cancel the contract with the government owned Security Company in which the two security guards were employed, and also to remove the Director Operations.
