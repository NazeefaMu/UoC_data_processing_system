Co founded by Dr. Ruwan Ekanayake and Dr.Ranjith Y. De Silva the Trust Fund is formulated to help heart patients who are in need of immediate heart surgery but cannot afford the heavy financial costs involved when such surgery is done at private hospitals.  All surgeries are performed at the same hospital under an expert panel of doctors and nursing staff. All donations made to this fund are solely used for surgeries under the Heart to Heart project.
