Former president Mahinda Rajapaksa was not a god and there was no need to protest against the Bribery Commission decision to summon him, Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) General Secretary and Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said today.
He said even he had given a statement to the Commission with regard to a complaint he had made on a deal of coal.
“No need to be afraid or to hesitate to give a statement to the Commission if the person had done nothing wrong. And others should not protest and obstruct attempts of the Commission to record statements,” he told a news conference today.  
However, he said the charge levelled against Mr. Rajapaksa that he had given MP Tissa Attanayake a ministerial post as a bribe, raised the question whether the charges was appropriate.
“As the incident happened during the election campaign, the Elections Commissioner should have taken care of it. If the reason behind making the charges at this crucial moment to postpone the 19th Amendment, then I believe it had been successful,” he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
