Planned rally an attempt to divide SLFP - SB

Social Empowerment and Welfare Minister S.B.Dissanayake said the planned rally by the Joint Opposition on Thursday, is an attempt to divide the SLFP and it would also be beneficial to the UNP, JVP and LTTE terrorists.
We urge the SLFP members not to participate in this act of betrayal, but to join hands to take the party forward, he said.
Addressing a media briefing held in Colombo yesterday, the minister said it had proved that if a particular MP is found guilty of violating party disciplines, he or she would have to fore-go the Parliamentary seat. But we do not want to unnecessarily take disciplinary action to create unwanted problems in the party. But it is our responsibility to protect the party.
Therefore, I urge all SLFP members not to participate in acts that could divide the party. We have all strength to go forward as a single party, despite various internal issues. It is our duty to work together to win the the SLFP and help make President Maithripala’s dream of coming into power by 2020 a reality.
Although the Joint Opposition said around 1,600 SLFP members attended the previous rally in Negombo, only around 600 people participated.
This shows that the SLPErs are not with former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.
Even during the previous Presidential election, most SLPErs felt helpless and it was a blessing that a Presidential candidate was our then General Secretary President Maithripala Sirisena. At all other times when the SLFP was defeated in elections, our supporters were subjected to violence. But on this occasion nothing happened. It was a great strength to our party.
