CLINICAL ATTACK ON SURGEON What action have the line ministries taken?


	



The Daily Mirror edition of 17 August 2018 carried an article in which an appeal was made by Sunil, a paddy cultivator in Badulla, whose wife Jayanthi (34) had been diagnosed with Meningothelial Meningioma, a rare disease that needed further treatment at a cost of Rs. 400,000. Follow-up surgery by a highly skilled neurosurgeon was required to replace an artificial skull in place of the part of her skull that had already been removed.   

The writer contacted Sunil and agreed to help him in his hour of need after obtaining positive feedback from a few friends who were also ready to help with the cost of surgery.   

Today in Sri Lanka our People’s Representatives think not twice on spending Rs. 240,000 of our tax payer’s hard earned money on a single office chair to sit on, perchance to portray their false sense of importance, when a 34-year-old woman with three little children aged 12, 7, and 5 is languishing helplessly for want of a mere Rs.400,000.   

 


Mercifully, the hapless couple knew nothing about the tragic incident and had only been informed by the hospital that the young surgeon is on extended leave


 

On 21 August, in the same newspaper appeared a carefully written feature article by Kalani Kumarasinghe headlined ‘Clinical assault of surgeon questions morality of students’. The incident had occurred within the Peradeniya University premises and what had transpired was shocking. A band of student strikers had assaulted a young surgeon whilst he was on the phone attending to his patient’s needs. The victim Dr. Yohan Koralage was one of only 13 neurosurgeons serving in Sri Lanka and also the doctor who had attended to the initial surgery on Jayanthi. Mercifully, the hapless couple knew nothing about the tragic incident and had only been informed by the hospital that the young surgeon is on extended leave. I am made to understand that Dr. Koralage has suffered serious injuries to his head and hands with little hope for full recovery.   

What action have the line ministries taken in this regard or are they even aware of what is happening in the Health Sector and the Law and Order Sector that allows such horrific incidents to continue unabated? Why are such hooligans allowed to roam free in the hallowed grounds of Peradeniya while a young mother is eagerly awaiting medical attention and the precious life of a young doctor is in such peril?

we need to know the answers and we need to know them now.
