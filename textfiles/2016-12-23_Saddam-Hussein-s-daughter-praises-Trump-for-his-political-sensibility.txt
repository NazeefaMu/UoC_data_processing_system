(Daily Mail, London), 22 December 2016 - Saddam Hussein’s daughter has praised Donald Trump for his ‘high level of political sensibility’ and his opposition to the war in Iraq. The 48-year-old, who now lives in Jordan after fleeing Iraq in 2003, also welcomed the President-elect’s opposition to the Iraq war. She said: ‘He exposed the mistakes of the others, specifically in terms of Iraq, which means he is very aware of the mistakes made in Iraq and what happened to my father.’  Raghad said she blames the US for the chaos that still blighting Iraq, hopes that President-elect Donald Trump will be different from his predecessors, including then-president George W. Bush.Bush claimed that Saddam’s execution in December 2006 ‘would not have been possible without the Iraqi people’s determination to create a society governed by the rule of law.’   


However, following his death, Iraq descended into an decade of sectarianism and violence.
