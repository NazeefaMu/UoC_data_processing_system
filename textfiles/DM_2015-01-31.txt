Canada welcomes the reinstatement of Shirani Bandaranayake as Chief Justice of the Sri Lankan Supreme Court. In January 2013, at the time of the Chief Justices impeachment, I expressed deep concern about the opaque and politicized nature of her impeachment, an action that severely undermined the legitimacy of the rule of law in Sri Lanka, Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister John Baird said.
Issuing a statement Mr. Baird said it hoped that President Maithripala Sirisena fulfils the mandate given to him by the people of Sri Lanka to foster a transparent, responsive and pluralistic government and assured that Canada would continue to encourage progress in the devolution of power, accountability and genuine reconciliation.
Following the successful elections earlier this month, it is our hope that President Maithripala Sirisena fulfills the mandate given to him by the people of Sri Lanka to foster a transparent, responsive and pluralistic government. Canada will continue to encourage progress in the devolution of power, accountability and genuine reconciliation, Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister John Baird said.
Mr. Baird said they also welcomed the recent appointment of a civilian, H.M.G.S. Palihakkara, to replace a retiring senior military commander as governor of the predominantly Tamil Northern Province.
Canada continues to have serious concerns about the human rights situation, the need for reconciliation and the democratic deficit in Sri Lanka. Canada will continue to raise these concerns forcefully, without equivocation, he said.
Mr. Baird said Canada had strongly supported resolutions at both the United Nations and the Commonwealth condemning the Sri Lankan governments lack of action on reconciliation and the countrys disturbing slide in human rights.
Canada is pushing for this latest troubling development to be addressed at the next meeting of the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group (CMAG), of which Minister Baird is a member, he said.

Gotabhaya hands over two baby elephants: Dy Minister
	
		Former Defense Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa has handed over two baby elephants that were kept in his care to the zoo, Deputy Minister of Wildlife Wasantha Senanayake said.
	
	During a press briefing held today, Minister Senanayake stated one of the elephant calves, which is four years old  had been held in his care upon obtaining legal authorization through a valid registration.
	
	He has handed over two elephant calves to the zoo with his own consent. The baby elephants are in good health. The two calves had been taken into his care in 2009 and 2010. The second calf without a valid registration had been handed over to him by the Pinnawala elephant orphanage through a contract in agreement to care for it, he said.
	
	The Minister also added that Gotabhaya had obtained an application to register the second calf and therefore, the allegations that are being leveled against him on holding baby elephants illegally, are not acceptable.
	
	However, Minister Senanayake further stated that although no illegalities have occurred, measures will be taken to track down the original owners of the two calves.

My brothers asked not to attend rugger practice-Namal
	
Hambantota UPFA MP Namal Rajapaksa said that his two younger brothers-Yoshitha and Rohitha-who were members of the Sri Lanka Army and Navy rugger teams, were asked not to attend rugby practice without citing any reasons.
Just a few days ago, my brothers  Rohitha and Yoshitha  were both informed, by telephone, not to attend rugby practice. No reasons were given. They were just asked not to come, Mr.Rajapaksa said in his personal blog.
Earlier media reports said Yoshitha and Rohitha were to be removed from the captaincy of the Rugby teams of the Navy and Army respectively, on the instructions of a highly placed official.
Mr. Rajapaksa also said that his family decided to respect the request and not to question the decision regardless of how unjust it seems.
Not wanting to tarnish the sport through any potential conflict, we took a decision to simply respect the request and not question the decision regardless of how unjust it seems. Though deeply hurtful, we felt this would be the best decision we could make at this time, he said.
The full statement issued by Mr. Rajapaksa

Having begun playing around the age of six, we played during school, during college, captained university teams and finally represented Sri Lanka internationally. In addition to enjoying the game, in recent years, we also tried to do whatever we could to elevate the sport in Sri Lanka for younger generations that will follow us in the years to come. In this effort, we brought down internationally-acclaimed rugby players to Sri Lanka and worked to get access for our players to obtain playing experience abroad.

In all honesty, we simply enjoyed playing the game. And as we began to reach the final stages of our sports careers, we felt like we should try to give back to a sport that had given us all so much. I think and hope that these efforts would have made at least a small contribution to the development of the game.

Today, were incredibly saddened to see that the bitter, vengeful politics that took over this country after elections earlier this month, have even made its way to the sports sector. Just a few days ago, my brothers  Rohitha and Yoshitha  were both informed, by telephone, not to attend rugby practice. No reasons were given. They were just asked not to come.

Not wanting to tarnish the sport through any potential conflict, we took a decision to simply respect the request and not question the decision regardless of how unjust it seems. Though deeply hurtful, we felt this would be the best decision we could make at this time.

For some, rugby was also a part of politics. But for the three of us, it was the sport we loved.

On behalf of both of my brothers and myself, I want express our deepest gratitude to all those who supported us during our rugby careers. I think you all know how sincerely we loved the game. And if given the opportunity, we will never hesitate for a moment to contribute to the development of the sport in any way that we can.
