The Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) said today it would consider accommodating the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) only if it left the UNP-led government.

Its chairman G.L. Peiris told Daily Mirror his party paid their cash deposits at the Kalutara District Secretariat to contest the election to the local authorities.

He said his party would pay the cash deposits to contest the elections to all local authorities.

Prof. Peiris said this amid reports about talks to unite the SLPP and the SLFP in view of the elections.

He said the main condition for uniting the two factions was that of the SLFP quitting the UNP- led government. (Kelum Bandara)
