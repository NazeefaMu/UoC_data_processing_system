Mayweather promotes video of himself in twerking stripper party

The controversial fighter known as "Money" Wednesday posted the kind of video fans of the 38-year old would be all too familiar with. The undefeated welterweight champion successfully defended his title by defeating unfancied Andre Berto in a unanimous decision in September and took home a purse of $32 million for his efforts less than six months after he earned a staggering $180 million for his superfight with Manny Pacquiao.
Since then, however, Mayweather's life has been a steady stream of cash and strippers. He posted a video today of himself throwing away bills of money while standing next to half-naked twerking strippers. What else would you do with twerking strippers at 5am? He posted it to his Instagram and Twitter accounts before repeating the posts six hours later with a higher quality version of the video.
