Responding to several isolated incidents happening regarding the controversial full face helmets ban, Police Spokesman DIG Priyantha Jayakody said so far the law has not been enforced as there is a Supreme Court hearing regarding the issue.

He said so when Daily Mirror questioned on the information received that several police officers had threatened those who wear the full face helmets forcing them not to do so.

“The court has given an interim order regarding the issue not to take action against the full face helmets. Therefore, though the gazette notification on the matter has been issued preventing the riders and the pillion riders wearing full face helmets, we could not put the law into force,” he said.

DIG Jayakody said that there can be few isolated incidents happening, however all the police station had been advised on the situation and not to take action against full face helmets.

Further, he said if there are any cases regarding the matter, the victim could complain directly to Police Headquarters as the police do not have any authority to take action against the helmet wears’ until the court order.

Meanwhile, issuing a statement the Ceylon Motorcyclists’ Association has also noted that many incidents had been reported to their association throughout the country that police officers are threatening motorcyclists’ not to wear full face helmets. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
