UK, (Daily Mail), 15 March 2018 -   Russia faces a wall of condemnation from Britain, the US, France and Germany today over the Salisbury nerve agent outrage.   


A joint statement from Theresa May, Donald Trump, Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron says there is ‘no plausible alternative explanation’ to Moscow being involved in the attempted murder of a former spy on UK soil.   


Speaking in Salisbury after the declaration was published, Mrs May said: ‘This happened in the UK, but it could have happened anywhere and we are taking a united stance against it.’
