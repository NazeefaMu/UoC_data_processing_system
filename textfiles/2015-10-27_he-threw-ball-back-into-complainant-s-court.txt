He threw ball back into complainant’s court


	


A Green party heavyweight of the Yahapalanaya had complained to the new strongman about the hard-hitting comments recently made by the Ministerial one in charge of airports in addition to road and rail transport. 
“This one could have easily taken up this issue either with me or our party leader instead of going ho ha about it. If we start fighting over minor issues like this, the trade unions of the two parties will also decide to join the fray leading to a big crisis!,” the Green stalwart had told the new strongman. 
The new strongman had a ready answer to the Green party man. “I originally assigned only ‘Transport’ to this Ministerial one. But your bosses wanted me to give him airports as well. And I complied with their request. So this thing is your baby and you yourselves have to look after it!” 
And that stumped the Green party heavyweight!
