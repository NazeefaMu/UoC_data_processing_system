Well-known drug kingpin Samantha Kumara Alias Wele Suda, who is in CID custody, was produced before the Colombo High Court this morning.
The Court allowed the CID to detain the suspect and three others under detention order until March 23, as the CID informed the Court that they need more time to question him.
Wele Suda was arrested in Pakistan and brought to Sri Lanka on February 14 by the CID in connection with a large number of cases connected to the drug dealings.Video by Sanath Desmond
