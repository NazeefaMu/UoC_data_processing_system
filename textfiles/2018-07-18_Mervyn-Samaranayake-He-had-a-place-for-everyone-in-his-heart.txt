Mervyn Samaranayake : He had a place for everyone in his heart


	



Mervyn Samaranayake passed away on July 18 in 1990. I write this with much feeling.   

A feeling of happiness for the beautiful memories we have of him. Feelings of sadness as he is no more with us to share life’s joys and sorrows. He was the son of the late W.H. Samaranayake the author of ‘Practical English,’ founder and former Principal of St. Bernadette’s College, Polgahawela. He hailed from a distinguished family. He was loved and admired by all and was a silent social worker. His devotion to duty was unique. He was a staunch member of the Roman Catholic Church and no believer of caste, creed or colour. Men of the stamp, mettle and genius of the calibre of the late Mervyn Samaranayake are indeed rare today.  

He was blessed with two children. May God Almighty grant him eternal rest!  
‘Twenty eight years ago on this sad day, 
The one we loved was called away,  
God took him home, it was His will,  
But in our hearts he lives still.  

Cecil R. Senanayake.
