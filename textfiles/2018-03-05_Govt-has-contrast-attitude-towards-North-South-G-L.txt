Govt. has contrast attitude towards North, South- G.L


	

The government has contrasting ways of dealing with public demonstrations in the Northern Province and the other parts of the country, the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) Head Prof. G.L. Peiris said today.

Addressing a news briefing, he asked as to why the government was silent on the protest in Mullaitivu where some people motivated by TNA were demanding 600 acres of land at Wattuwakal be distributed among original owners.

However, he said the Police had different ways of dealing with the group of farmers in Thambuttegama who were mercilessly beaten during their agitation of using water from the Rajanganaya Tank for a water supply project.

“The government should have considered the couple of issues equally and taken steps accordingly. These types of behaviours of the government would trigger racial issues which would vastly affect the country’s security apparatus,” he said.

Meanwhile, he said that the SLFP members who are affiliated to the Unity Government are reluctant to vote in favour of the proposed No- Confidence Motion against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. (Sheain Fernandopulle)
