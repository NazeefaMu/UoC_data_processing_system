Cabinet spokesman and Health Minister, Rajitha Senaratne said no politics was involved in the shutting down of the Polgahawela transmission station belonging to the Telshan Network (Pvt) Ltd, (TNL) and the decision was independently taken by the Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (TRC) based on its regulations.

Addressing the weekly cabinet news briefing today, he said the government expected that it would reopen sooner than later after the liscence fees were paid to the TRC.

“This government has no intention of shutting down media establishments like in the past but to give them the full freedom to function independently. I believe that the TNL will start operations in the next few days,” the minister said.  (Sandun A Jayasekera)
