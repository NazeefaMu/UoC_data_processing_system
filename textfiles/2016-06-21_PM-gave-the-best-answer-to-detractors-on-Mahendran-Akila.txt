Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has given the best answer to those who want the Government not to re-appoint Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran , Minister of Education Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said yesterday.

He was referring to media reports that the Prime Minister had assured civil society groups that Mr Mahendran would not be re-appointed till the investigations into the controversial CB bond scam has been concluded.

“Mr. Mahendran will be dealt with if he it is proved that he had done something wrong but the Government is not prepared to do what some elements including the joint opposition want it to do,” the minister said.

He said the present Government had compelled the former Law and Order Minister Tilak Marapana to resign from his post when there were issues and the Government would do so when it came to Mr. Mahendran appointment as well.

“Another example of this Government listening to the people is the removal of Value Added Tax (VA) from healthcare services and that’s how a government should work,” the minister said. (Yohan Perera)
