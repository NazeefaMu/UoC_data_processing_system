Who cooked up the story?


	



 

The Betel Leaf Secretarial one himself has now gone public that four top team members had taken the initiative to cook up and release to media the sensational story about the RAW being behind the conspiracy to bump off two prominent public figures here.

 


He also claimed that they had already identified two of the culprits adding that he would come out with the four names once the other two were identified.


When the RAW story was spreading like wildfire, a diplomatic mission representing a powerful nation in this region had reportedly launched an investigation to ascertain the origin of this story.


They, in fact, had made it a point to make inquiries mostly from the top team members. Of the top ones, they had contacted, twelve of them had reportedly given the same reply. The compendium of information thus gathered from the Yahapalanaya Bigwigs themselves has now become a precious possession of the mission in question, 
they say.
