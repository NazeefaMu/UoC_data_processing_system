A ploy to escape the wrath of erstwhile mates


	


This stocky politico from down South better known for his shenanigans than for his work for the people was once a prominent follower of the former strongman.
 
He too received a consolation position at the distribution of plums by the Yahapalanaya.  And this ‘sell-out’ angered his erstwhile mates with whom he ganged up against the new strongman at the recent national polls. Soon he found himself at the receiving end of jibes and abusive epithets from them.  The politico later hit upon a plan to keep his detractors at bay. He called the former strongman over the phone. “Sir, I am in a hell of a fix,” he told the former mentor. “You are my only savior. You alone can rescue me. All my longstanding colleagues are at my neck for joining the yahapalanaya as a deputy.  Sir, please tell them I accepted this position after consulting you…”
The former strongman said briefly: “Hm! Okay!” and rang off, they say.
