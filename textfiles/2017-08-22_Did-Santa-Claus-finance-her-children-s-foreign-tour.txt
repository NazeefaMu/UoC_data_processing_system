Did Santa Claus finance her children’s foreign tour?


	



 

A lady in charge of ‘cash payments’ in a state-owned business establishment had made an extensive tour in a foreign country together with her children.

 


The establishment had funded the lady’s foreign tour and she herself had borne all expenses in respect of her children who accompanied her on the tour.  This lady, said to be a direct appointee of the purohita responsible for the establishment, solely depends on her monthly pay for maintaining her family and the employees of the place openly wonder how she could afford the luxury of a foreign tour for her children.
