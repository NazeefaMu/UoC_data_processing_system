An unseen hand appears to have prevented the Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID) from arresting six people including an additional secretary attached to the Prime Minister’s office on charges of violating the Public Properties Act, the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) claimed today.

JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake told a media briefing that the FCID had failed to carry out the directive given of the Deputy Solicitor General on behalf of the Attorney General’s Department.

The letter had been forwarded to the FCID on May 18 directing that these people be arrested and produced in Court.

Mr. Dissanayake said the FCID had also failed to carry out an investigation into the illegal renting of a fisheries harbor by the then Fisheries Minister Rajitha Senaratne during the tenure of the previous regime.

“There were several instances of some ministers and secretaries of certain political parties instructing the FCID not to probe the wrongdoings certain opposition politicians because they were expected to cross over to the government,” he said.(Yohan Perera and Darshana Sanjeewa)
