Kiwis take aim at 30-year drought

Highly-rated New Zealand swing pair Tim Southee and Trent Boult will look to put the hosts’ new-look batting lineup to the sword at the Gabba from Thursday as the tourists chase their first series win in Australia for 30 years.
Without a series triumph in Australia since the halcyon days of Richard Hadlee and Martin Crowe in 1985, the Black Caps clearly sense a weakness in Steve Smith’s untested team following a raft of retirements.
The post-Ashes departures of former skipper Michael Clarke along with stalwarts Shane Watson, Chris Rogers, Brad Haddin and Ryan Harris have forced selectors to redraft Australia’s batting, but there are questions over the replacements.
Apart from Smith and his deputy David Warner, the rest of Australia’s batsmen can muster only a combined 29 Test appearances between Joe Burns (two), Usman Khawaja (nine), Adam Voges (seven), Peter Nevill (four) and Mitchell Marsh (seven).
That makes the Australians vulnerable, particularly if speedsters Southee and Boult get their act together on the bouncy, seaming Gabba pitch.
That might be easier said than done however as Australia reign supreme at the Brisbane ground where they have not lost a Test match since 1988, to Viv Richards’ mighty West Indies.
The Black Caps have lost six and drawn one of the seven Tests in Queensland since their last win at the Gabba in 1985 when they went on to take the series 2-1.
