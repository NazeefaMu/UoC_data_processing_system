In reference to the negative remarks that have been made by some UNP members recently against President Maithripala Sirisena, MP Rohitha Abeygunawardena said yesterday that they also hurt when such remarks are made against the President.

He told a news conference that as the incumbent President was the Secretary of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) during their regime, they also felt sorry for him and feel hurt themselves when they hear such things being said.“It is evident that the current SLFP members seem to be reluctant to voice their displeasure about the things said about their leader. Without being silent, they should raise their voices on behalf of the President. If such a thing happens to our leader, Mahinda Rajapaksa, we would not react in the way the SLFP members are reacting. We will definitely raise our voices on behalf of our leader,” Abeygunawardena said.

Meanwhile, he said the process of penalising those responsible for the bond scam was slow and laboured and seems to be going slow deliberately.“We urge President Sirisena to take instant action to punish the culprits irrespective of the high positions they enjoy, whether it is within the government or outside it,” Abeygunawardena added.
