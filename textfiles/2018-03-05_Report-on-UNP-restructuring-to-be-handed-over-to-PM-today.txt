A member of this committee told Daily Mirror that the report is ready and will be handed over to Prime Minister today, March 5.

A committee headed by State Minister of Defense Ruwan Wijewardene and comprising of state Ministers Ajith P. Perera, Harin Fernando and Akila Viraj Kariyawasam was appointed by the party leadership in the aftermath of the defeat which the UNP suffered at the recent local government election.

Prime Minister Wickremesinghe who was on an official tour to Singapore returned to the country yesterday.

Several senior members of the party had called for vast reforms of the party while Mr. Wickremesinghe himself had assured that the party would be handed over to a new leadership group soon. (Yohan Perera)
