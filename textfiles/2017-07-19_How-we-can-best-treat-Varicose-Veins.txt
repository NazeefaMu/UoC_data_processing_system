Are you also an individual who has been experiencing an unbearable achy pain in your legs since recently? On top of it, did you happen to notice some weird, bulging cord like structures with a bluish discolouration on those painful sites which are remarkably visible following prolonged hours of standing? Given the said symptoms and signs do they make it embarrassing to wear short, fashionable clothes to parties?   

 

If the answer to all the above questions is ‘yes’, there is a very high possibility that you are also a victim of this common surgical condition known as ‘Varicose Veins’.  

 

 

 

Definition 

Varicose Veins are defined as swollen, enlarged, twisted, bluish or purplish veins, most commonly visible on legs and feet. According to the latest research, approximately 23% of adults suffer from this condition and tend to seek help, not merely due to pain and discomfort but due to cosmetic reasons as well.   

 



Reasons 

Veins are cord like structures in our body which pump de-oxygenated blood to the heart in order to get purified and pumped all over the body through arteries. To carry out this function in a single direction, veins are structurally formed with valves inside. Individuals who are prone to get Varicose Veins have weakened or less flexible walls on veins, making the valves weaker, resulting in an accumulation of blood inside-thus leading to enlarged and swollen veins filled with de-oxygenated blood.   

 

This phenomenon can occur in the veins of our body, but legs and feet are the most affected. This is due to the gravitational forces in these lower parts of the body which further support the accumulation of blood within vessels.   

 

Even though it’s not very clear as to why the walls of the vessels haphazardly weaken, experts have related these potential risk factors regarding Varicose Veins:   

 

The incidence is higher in women due to the effect of hormones which are known to relax blood vessels   
	Menopause   
	Hormonal replacement therapy   
	Oral contraceptive Pills   
	Pregnancy   
	Age: Over 50   
	Prolonged hours of sitting and standing-house wives, garment workers   
	Family history of varicose veins   
	Obesity   
	Congenital abnormalities of veins   
	Other than that, any factor which contributes to excessive pressure on the abdomen can give rise to varicose veins which may include,   
	Pregnancy   
	Constipation   
	Tumours   
	Presentation
	Varicose Veins aren’t painful in a majority of the individuals, but are known to create unusual discomfort.   
	Twisted, swollen, lumpy veins   
	Bluish or purplish discolouration   
	A feeling of heaviness in legs specially after prolong hours of standing and at night   
	Burning or throbbing sensation in legs sometimes associated with heavy muscle cramps   
	Trauma to the affected site, causing a longer duration of bleeding than usual   
	Lipodermatosclerosis – hardening of fat under the skin just above the ankle, causing some shrunken appearance   
 

Swollen ankles   
	Telangiectasia in the affected leg (spider veins)   
	A Shiny, brownish or bluish discoloration over the skin of the affected site   
	Venous eczema (Stasis dermatitis) - Red, dry and itchy skin over the affected site sometimes resulting in Ulceration   
	Leg cramps on sudden change of posture   
	Restless legs syndrome   
	Atrophie blanche – Irregularly whitish scary patches on ankles   
	Can it give rise to serious complications?
	Yes, untreated severe varicose veins can result in complications including:   
	Leg ulcers- Extremely painful, inflamed areas particularly near ankles as a result of long term fluid accumulation and excessive pressure in affected sites. The most initial sign could be a discoloured spot. So if you happen to spot one, it’s advisable to seek immediate medical advice.   
	Blood clots- Occasionally these swollen veins can get further enlarged within a short period of time. This indicates the necessity for immediate medical attention, because there can be the presence of a blood clot obstructing the circulation as a result of stagnant and slow blood flow.   
	Bleeding- In some individuals, veins located closer to the skin can burst causing minor bleeding, but it’s always advisable to obtain medical care as there is a high chance for this kind of a bleeding to re-occur.   
 

 

Diagnosis

Following a complete history (achy pain or discomfort) and thorough physical examination, your doctor will come to a clinical diagnosis of varicose veins. He might also want to run an ‘Ultra Sound’ to detect any abnormalities in the blood flow and ‘Venogram’ to detect any underlying pathologies.

 

  

Treatment

Most health care professionals prefer conservative management on patients with this condition.   
	Life style modifications:   
	Avoid standing for prolonged hours   
	Maintaining a healthy weight   
	Exercises to improve blood circulation.   
	Using compression socks or stockings.   
	Surgical treatment (Vein ligation and stripping) is indicated in patients who experience unbearable pain affecting the quality of life, complications or cosmetic issues.   
 

 

Other treatment options:   

Sclerotherapy   
	Microsclerotherapy   
	Laser surgery   
	Endovenous ablation therapy   
	Endoscopic vein surgery   
	Take home message
Varicose veins usually worsen over a period of time if not managed properly. So, it’s up to you to seek medical advice without delaying, to avoid symptoms getting worse. This calls for invasive surgical treatment. Remember there are plenty of options to follow.
