Samsung has been a major force in smartphone camera innovation for a while now. Its Galaxy phones, especially top-tier flagships, have some of the best cameras you can find on a smartphone today. The company has been focusing on bringing some of its flagship technologies to the lower end of its portfolio as well, which is why we see the Infinity Display coming all the way down to the Galaxy J series. Samsung has been doing something similar with its camera technologies as well. On Thursday, however, the company surprised everyone by announcing a triple camera phone in its Galaxy A series.

The Galaxy A7 is the first phone from Samsung to sport a triple lens setup. It also happens to be the second phone after the Huawei P20 Pro to come with triple cameras. With this, the company is touting an impressive photography experience along with a sleek design and some useful features in a phone that will fall in the mid-range segment. Here's everything you need to know about the Galaxy A7.

Samsung Galaxy A7 features

-- The biggest highlight of the Galaxy A7 is, of course, its triple camera setup on the back. The 8MP + 24MP + 5MP setup promises to deliver crisp wide-angle photographs with support for depth sensing as well. The 24MP lens lets in more light by combining four pixels into one in low-light conditions.

-- The Galaxy A7's camera offers modes like Live Focus that will allow you to control the depth of field in real-time. Additionally, the Galaxy A7 also gets an Intelligent Scene Optimiser that allows the cameras to recognise the subject and adjust colour, contrast and brightness accordingly.

-- The 24MP front-facing camera gets LED flash support and the ability to capture bokehs with Selfie Focus. It also gets Pro Lighting Mode that mimics professional studio lighting, AR emoji, and filters.

-- In addition to an immersive Infinity Display, the Galaxy A7 also boasts an immersive sound experience thanks to Dolby Atmos support. The phone also brings a premium all-glass design and a side fingerprint sensor as well much like the Galaxy J6+.
