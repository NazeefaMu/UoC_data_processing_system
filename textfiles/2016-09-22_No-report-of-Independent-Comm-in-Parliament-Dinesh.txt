No report of Independent Comm. in Parliament: Dinesh


	

Joint Opposition's parliamentary group leader Dinesh Gunawardane said in Parliament yesterday that though one year had elapsed after the establishment of independent commissions, no report had been submitted to the House.

Asserting that it is a constitutional requirement, he said these commissions should report to Parliament.

Mr. Gunawardane took this up under a Point of Order. The Speaker said he was taking steps in this direction.

Leader of the House Lakshman Kiriella said the previous government had crippled the functions of such commissions for ten years, but no action was taken. (Kelum Bandara and Yohan Perera)
