The FCID today informed court that it had sent extracts of the two cases filed against MP Namal Rajapaksa and five others, on charges of money laundering, to the Attorney General seeking his opinion on filing indictments against the suspects at the High Court.

Additional Magistrate Nishantha Peiris subsequently fixed February 9 to obtain the Attorney General's opinion on the two cases.

The FCID also sought to impose Open Warrants on two suspects, Indika Karunajeewa and Iresha Silva, who are currently residing abroad.

The Magistrate directed the FCID to make the request with an affidavit on a later date to consider issuing such a warrant.

Other suspects, Pavithra Sujani Bogollagama, Nithya Senani Samaranayake, Sudarsha Bandara Ganegoda and Namal Rajapaksa were present at Court today and were released on the bail conditions granted previously. (Shehan Chamika Silva)
