Coca-Cola Beverages Sri Lanka Ltd. (CCBSL) partnered with the Marine Environment Protection Authority (MEPA) to collect PET bottles for recycling, at the National Program of the International Coastal Clean-up Day at Daddala Beach in Galle. The event also included recycler Eco-Spindles Pvt Ltd. (BPPL Group) and volunteers from AIESEC partnering to demonstrate the positive impact of ‘Harnessing the power of people towards an Ocean without Waste’ under the patronage and active involvement of H.E President Maithripala Sirisena. 

The initiative is part for The Coca-Cola Company’s commitment towards help creating a “World Without Waste”. World Without Waste is the Coca-Cola Company’s global goal to help collect and recycle the equivalent of 100% of its packaging by 2030. This goal is the centrepiece of the company’s new packaging vision in Sri Lanka as well. Through this, the Coca-Cola system in Sri Lanka intends not only to make packaging 100% recyclable but also collect and recycle the equivalent of 100% of its packaging in the country and work towards a cleaner and better environment. 

Rear Admiral (Retd) Rohana Perera, Chairman of Marine Environment Protection Authority said, “The risk of pollution of the ocean around Sri Lanka is increasing daily due to the influence of increased use of contaminants connected with development activities and increasing population. Large quantities of non-degradable waste get absorbed into coast and marine environments directly or through the waterways. The National Coastal and Marine Resources Conservation Week is proving to be highly effective in improving coastal and marine environments, while increasing public participation in marine conservation initiatives.” 



Commenting on the successful initiative, Lakshan Madurasinghe – Country Public Affairs, Communications and Sustainability Manager, Coca-Cola Beverages Sri Lanka Ltd. said, “The Give Back Life program’s long-term vision is to work with host of strategic partners to deliver meaningful action towards a circular economy in which materials are used and reused to provide ongoing value. Following last year’s successful partnership of this same event, Coca-Cola is delighted to cement its association yet again in 2018. Most importantly, this national event is sending a clear ‘reuse, reduce and recycle’ message to the citizens of the country. Our vision is to ensure that all our PET packaged material is recovered and recycled to minimize its environmental impact through the supporting of recycling programs and inspiring our consumers to recycle more, while creating livelihood opportunities for waste collection workers across Sri Lanka.”

Natasha Perera, National Director – Partnership Development of AIESEC Sri Lanka commented, “AIESEC is delighted to take a proactive step in preserving our marine environment by partnering the International Coastal Clean-up Day. This event provided a unique opportunity for AIESEC volunteers to come together and give of their time and effort in cleaning our beaches while taking it upon themselves to spread the message of recycling. Sri Lanka is blessed with a wonderful marine and costal environment and it is in our interests, as youth and future leaders of the country, to ensure we preserve our environment.”

Coca-Cola Beverages Sri Lanka Ltd. partners at this event as part of its extended producer responsibility, to “Give Back Life” to collect marine debris along beaches. Throughout the National Marine Resources Week, all PET bottles collected by the volunteers would be collected and recycled through its partnership with Eco-Spindles (part of BPPL Holdings). The PET will then be upcycled into janitorial products for household and commercial use and yarn, thus utilising the maximum value of PET.
