Allah Almighty says in the glorious Quran:  “O you who believe, observing the fasting is prescribed for you as it was prescribed for those before you that you may become the pious”  
(Quran 2:183)

The Holy Quran makes it obvious by prescribing Ramadan fasting as one of the cardinal principles of Islam. The main object of fasting is to promote righteousness - a progressive cultivation of spiritual values.  

Muslims throughout the world celebrate Id-Ul-Fitr (Ramadan Festival after ending fasting during the month of Ramadan.  

Before the advent of Islam, Arabs used to celebrate certain days and occasions in an uncivilized way indulging in drinking gambling, adultery etc. But after Prophet Muhammad (PBUM), Islam changed that barbaric pattern of society and introduced a civilized refined and cultured way of celebrating.  


 Id-ul-fitr is the occasion to demonstrate self-discipline and moral consciousness earned through the devotional exercise of fasting during the holy month of Ramadan


The aim of Id-ul-fitr is to introduce a cultured form of celebration that offers the following benefits to mankind.  

Id-ul-fitr gives the true picture of social equality when all the Muslims irrespective of caste, creed and colour, Wealth and position gather together and bow down before Allah the Almighty. 

The only greatness in their mind is the greatness of Allah, which they also utter with their tongues.  

“Allah is the most Great, Allah is the most Great. None is worthy to be worshipped besides Allah. And (IU again declare) Allah is the most Great. Allah is the most Great”.  

On this great and happy occasion a Muslim does not forget the poor. Charity is the form of “Sadagathul Fitr” (Commonly known as Fitrah) is compulsory for all Muslims who have an adequate amount of wealth as prescribed in Islamic Law. Id-ul-fitr is the occasion to demonstrate self-discipline and moral consciousness earned through the devotional exercise of fasting during the holy month of Ramadan. To achieve real success in all circumstance in life a disciplined moral-self is indispensable. The day of Id is the starting point of that disciplined life which was fashioned in the form of tasting.  

Id-ul-fitr is a valuable occasion through which Islamic values and culture could be transmitted from individual to individual.  

At this juncture we must comprehend that social and spiritual bliss cannot be achieved without a strong inner conviction. Honesty cannot be advocated for other if we cannot practice it ourselves Love and affection cannot be strengthened if we ourselves cannot practice it.  

Fasting builds up God-consciousness (Thaqwa) in out hearts and it trains ourselves to render a service to mankind.  

Let us, therefore, on this important and significant occasion return to this natural and purified state in which God crated us. Let us from this day, Maintain this state freed from sins, so that we can truly without evil and distracting temptations that are reigning mankind. The difficulties of man cannot but by transforming himself from within.  
It is only when man has found peace within himself and when he has built up the virtues of tolerance and discipline that he can radically approach and eliminate his problems and fasting helps us to this end.   

This Id-ul-fitr conveys the message of “Social quality” charity to the poor and self-discipline to all mankind irrespective of their social status and ethnic origins.  

As this juncture it is our profound duty as free Muslims to transmit these noble values to other nations. May Allah guide us to achieve these noble aims and grant us the good of this world and the good in the hereafter.
