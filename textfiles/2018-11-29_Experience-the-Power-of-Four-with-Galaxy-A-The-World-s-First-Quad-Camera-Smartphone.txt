World’s First Rear Quad Camera 

 

• Galaxy A9’s camera comes with a telephoto lens capable of 2x optical zoom that allows you to take crisp, detailed shots, even from a distance. This is perfect for macro-photography, wildlife photography and any situation where you need to get up-close to the action.

 

• With Galaxy A9’s 24MP main lens, you can capture clear and bright images in both bright and low light conditions. In low light conditions, the A9 intelligently merges pixels to allow more light so that you get the best pictures in the day or at night.

 

• Galaxy A9 helps you express your creativity with the Depth Lens, giving you the freedom to manually manage the photos’ depth of field and focus on the subject for stunning, professional looking images. Thanks to Live focus, every picture you take is now display picture worthy.

 

• Galaxy A9’s Ultra-Wide Angle camera allows you to capture not only your subject, but the whole scene. Presently, where most smartphones capture 77 degrees in their field of view, Galaxy A9 is able to capture 120 degrees; this lets you capture more expansive photos, just like what your eyes see. This comes in handy when you need to capture landscapes, city scape, group shoots or in any situation where you need to fit a lot into a single frame.

 

Galaxy A9 automatically recognizes 19 kinds of scenes and optimizes colour settings to suit the content—whether it’s a nightscape, a field of flowers, or a plate of food. Now you don’t need to worry about tedious details like colour saturation, white balance, and brightness. Enjoy the scenery, and let the Galaxy A9 do the hard work. Galaxy A9 also intelligently detects when there is a flaw in an image you just clicked (like closed eyes, facial blur or back-light) and notifies you so that you can capture the picture perfect moment.
