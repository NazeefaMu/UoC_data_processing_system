Taylor Swift is her Clothing Line’s own Best Model

Feast your eyes on further proof that Taylor Swift will never go out of style.
As in, her street style is (and continues to be) one of the most influential fashion factors on the block. In fact, she’s one of the ultimate trendsetters on the planet. Familiar with #LegsForDays? She basically invented it with her colossal number of leggy looks. Those ‘50s-chic frocks? She singlehandedly brought ‘em back. And as for the crop top, well, it might as well be her calling card.
So duh—it’s about time she launched a clothing line !
After first announcing her clothing collaboration with Heritage 66 back in July, the first items from T. Swift’s line have finally hit the e-shelves of the Chinese retailer’s website. And bad news, US shoppers—these Swiftie steals are only available in China. But seeing as she’s the face (and name) behind the line, or course this street style star would rock a few of her own goods.
Popping up at LAX in between the Chinese and Australian legs of her 1989 world tour, Miss Swift sported her letter-printed sweater (hint, hint: they all go together to spell one very important name) along with a black skirt and sweater tied around her waist. Oh, and let’s not forget about her staple red pout, which is a given in any of her looks.
In addition to said sweater, the 30-piece collection has plenty of Swift-finger printed designs, from namesake T-shirts to tight leggings and even a sweet little skater dress. On the bright side, yes, you’ve still got to wait for Tay’s collection to make its way stateside, but in the meantime you can still shop her Keds collection. E! Online
