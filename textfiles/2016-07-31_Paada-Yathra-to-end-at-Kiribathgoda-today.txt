Residents of Rathupaswala have left dozens of bottles filled with water on roads in Balummahara, Rathupaswala for the use of protesters of Jana Satana Paada Yathra organised by the Joint Opposition marking the third anniversary of Rathupaswala clash.


However, the police had removed the water bottles from the road citing a tense situation would take place between the Rathupaswala residents and Paada Yathra participants.


The residents had organised a commemoration event marking the third anniversary of Rathupaswala clash where the people demanded clean water. Three protesters died at the clash and thirty three others were injured.


The Paada Yathra was passing Imbulgoda a short while ago and the former president and Kurunegala MP Mahinda Rajapaksa joined the march at Imbulgoda junction.


The procession commenced its fourth day at Nittabuwa junction this morning and would end at Kiribathgoda today.
