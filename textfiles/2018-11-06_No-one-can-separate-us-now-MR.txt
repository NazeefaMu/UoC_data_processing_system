No one can separate us now: MR


	

In their first ever major public rally after the new government was formed, Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa yesterday said no one could separate his alliance with President Maithripala Sirisena.

Mr. Rajapaksa said they have come to an agreement not to allow any tattle-tale to separate them. “No one can set us against each other now,” he told the Rata Surakina Jana Mahimaya rally.

He said he is committed to work with the President to establish democracy in the country, to salvage it from the alienation and to develop it including the North and East.

He also invited political parties which represent minority groups to join the new government to uplift the people’s livelihood irrespective of ethnic or other differences.

Meanwhile, the Prime Minister said the decision taken by the President to appoint him as the Prime Minister was a serious one. “Parting ways temporarily is not a strange phenomena in politics. We have joined today for the sake of the country, to prevent further alienation of it so that we can create a better country for future generations of Sri Lanka,” he said.

He said he was able to reduce taxes and also fuel prices in a day after assuming duties as the Finance Minister. “If I could have done it, that means they (previous government) could have also done it. However, they were focused on their well being instead of the people,” Mr. Rajapaksa said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
