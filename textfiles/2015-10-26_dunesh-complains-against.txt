Dunesh Priyashantha, alias Kondaya, who was recently released after being arrested on suspicion over the murder of Seya Sandewmi of Kotadeniyawa, lodged a complaint with the Police Commission today.
In his complaint, he has requested the Police Commission to launch an investigation to find the CID officers who had allegedly beaten Dunesh and forced him to sign a confessional statement.
He had also requested the commission to investigate into the remarks made by Police Spokesman Ruwan Gunasekara to the media regarding the recent revelations made by Dunesh.
Attorney Udul Premaratne appearing on behalf of Dunesh Priyashantha, said the complaint cited another two key points, namely – the abduction and publicizing false information about Dunesh. (Piyumi Fonseka)
