Field Marshall Sarath Fonseka today challenged President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to remove Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe from the government, if they wanted to maintain ‘Good Governance’ in the country.
Addressing a news conference, he said the Minister continuing to defend the Avant Garde Maritime Security Company and its floating armoury, when it had been proved that the floating armoury was illegal.
“The Minister continues to mislead people with his false statements in a bid to protect Avant Garde. Even the Attorney General, who retired recently took no action on Avant Garde but immediately directed to arrest MP Hirunika Premachandra. We already know that Justice Minister has links with the maritime company’s Chairman,” he said.
