Police yesterday arrested a 54-year-old school bus driver whose right hand was disabled below the elbow and had a defective ear due to a birth defect. The man who was arrested at Horana had not possessed a driving licence too though there had been 30 children on the bus at the time of his arrest.

On a tip -off received about this disabled driver who was driving the vehicle with the children, he had been arrested close to Sri Pali college in Horana by a team of police officers under the direction of Horana Traffic Police OIC Wimal Ananda. When questioned from the suspect about his driving, he had said that his father had previously driven the school vehicle and after his father’s death, he had been doing this task without any violation of road rules.

The OIC said parents and those who obtain the services of school transport should be careful about those who drive the vehicles.

Police said they would prosecute the driver and the owner of the bus concerned in this regard.

Horana Chief Police Inspector HQ. Prasanna Welikala is investigating the incident. (Bimal Shaman Jayasinghe and Upul Gunasekera)
