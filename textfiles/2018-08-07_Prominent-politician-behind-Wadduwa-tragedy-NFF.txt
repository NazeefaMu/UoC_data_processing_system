The National Freedom Front (NFF) today accused the Police of not taking steps to arrest those responsible for the Wadduwa tragedy where four persons died during a Facebook party at a hotel's beach front in Wadduwa.

NFF national organizer Jayantha Samaraweera told a news briefing that the Police was unable to take action because there was a prominent politician involved in organizing the beach party.

“According to the information we have gathered, then Mount Lavinia Police OIC Chief Inspector Lalith Weerasinghe was transferred to the Wadduwa Police on the instruction of a prominent politician in South while the Wadduwa Police OIC was transferred to Dodangoda Police Station. We found that the organizers had obtained a liquor license, a permit for the use of loudspeakers with security provided by Avant Garde Security Service,” Mr. Samaraweera said.

He said this was an event where drugs had been ‘excessively’ used. (Sheain Fernandopulle)
