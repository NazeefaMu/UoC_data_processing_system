Minister Faiszer Musthapha had been perplexed following the false media allegations of connection to a youth who was arrested in Sydney over a document that the Australian Police allege contained plans for terrorist attacks, Deputy Minister H. M. M. Harees said today.

Deputy Minister Harees said that he spoke to Minister Musthapha after several foreign reports highlighted the Minister’s relationship to the accused.

“The Minister was deeply shocked of the accusation as he was not a pro terrorist person,” Harees said.

“The accused was not directly related to the Minister but a relative of his wife. Faiszer is a character that strongly concern for the country more than the Muslims. I’m disappointed about these reports. Just because the student is accused of a crime, it doesn’t mean he is guilty. Just because a person is related to the Minister it doesn’t mean the Minister too is involved,” he said.

He said that the incident had tarnished the country’s image and could impact the bilateral relations between the two countries.

The Deputy Minister urged that the Foreign Affair Ministry should interfere to the matter as the accused was a PhD student with a sound background and according to his family he was framed to the incident.

“I humbly request all local and foreign media to not to accuse the Minister based on false information. I can assure that Minister Musthapha is a gentlemen and a patriot,” Deputy Minister Harees added.   

25-year-old Kamar Nizamdeen, who was employed by a Sydney University has been charged over a document that Australian Police allege, contained plans for terrorist attacks. The 25-year-old was arrested by counter-terrorism officers at the University of NSW in Kensington on August 31.
However, Friends and family of the accused claimed that Nizamdeen was framed. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
