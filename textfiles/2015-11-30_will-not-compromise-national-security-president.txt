President Maithripala Sirisena assured that he would not take any decision under any circumstances that would compromise the national security when he met the Sri Lankan community in France today.
President Sirisena said he was able to restore the prestige and dignity of Sri Lanka in the global arena after a period of negative and hostile attitude towards Sri Lanka by the international community.
The extremely positive approach by the international community was clearly manifested during his cordial and friendly discussions with a number of world leaders during the just concluded CHOGM in Malta, he said.
British Prime Minister David Cameron, Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, were among the world leaders who met President Sirisena during the CHOGM.
President Sirisena expressed his gratitude to expatriate Sri Lankans living in France for their contribution to nation building and said he expected to meet all expatriate Sri Lankans living abroad in future.
He said he loved Sri Lanka as much as or even more than any other Sri Lankan and vowed that he would never compromise national security under any circumstances. He said this at a meeting with the members of the Sri Lankan community in France at the Embassy of Sri Lanka in Paris on November 29.
The representatives of the Sri Lankan community asked about allegations that some actions of the government could adversely affect the national security and the President replied that he was totally committed to the safety, security and integrity of Sri Lanka and he would never allow anybody to take any action that could be affect the national sovereignty or security.
He pointed out that his government was installed only 10 months ago and detailed out the major achievements such as adoption of 19th Amendment to the Constitution, establishment of the Constitution Council, appointment of various Commissions including Judiciary Commission, Elections Commission, Police Commission and Public Service Commission.
He urged the diaspora representatives to extend all possible help to Sri Lanka for the development activities of the government. (Sandun A Jayasekera)
