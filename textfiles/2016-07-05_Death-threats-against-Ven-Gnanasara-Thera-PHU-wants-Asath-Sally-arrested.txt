Death threats against Ven. Gnanasara Thera / PHU wants Asath Sally arrested


	

The Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) today said Former Central Provincial Azath Sally, who was video taped allegedly threatening to assassinate Bodu Bala Sena General Secretary Ven. Galagodaththe Gnanasara Thera, should be arrested without delay.

PHU Publicity Secretary Thushara Dissanayake told a media briefing that if the roles were reversed and it had been Venerable Galagodaththe Gnanasara Thera that had made these death threats to Sally, the outcome would have been different and the so-called law and order authorities would have acted to arrest him.

“Azath Sally, who remained silent when ISIS terrorists beheaded innocent people claiming that their religion demanded it, without condemning the inhuman acts, has now threatened to kill a monk. We vehemently condemn his statement which is a slap in the face of sovereignty and unity among the religions,” he said.

As making death threats to someone is a punishable offence according to the Penal Code, Sally should be arrested and dealt with according to the law.

Meanwhile Sihala Ravaya convener Ven. Magalkande Sudaththa Thera and Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) Coordinator Dilantha Withanage today lodged a complaint at the Police Head Quarters to arrest Mr. Sally. (Piyumi Fonseka)
