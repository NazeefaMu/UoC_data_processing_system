Lands and Parliamentary Reforms Minister Gayantha Karunatilake speaks about the government’s plan for the future and the next presidential election. The excerpts of the interview:   

 

There is bitterness between President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. It seems to be high at the moment. How can the government proceed under such circumstances?

This is a novel experience. We are going through a unique period. The two main parties that were hostile to each other got together for the first time to form the government. It is a gigantic task. At the beginning, some thought this political marriage would end up in divorce very soon. Yet, we have run the government for three years. We cannot rule out irritants to both sides during this period, though. However, the President and the Prime Minister have undertaken an arduous journey. We delivered a lot to the people. There are major changes introduced to the country after we took office. The public service is devoid of political influence today. There is media freedom. We delivered what we promised to the people. We increased Samurdhi benefits to people. We brought down fuel prices by a huge margin. We did not increase prices for three years. Despite the latest hike, fuel prices are still lower than what they were during the former rule. In fact, we increased payment for public servants by Rs.10,000 a month.   

 


Those involved in bond fraud should be exposed


 

Some within the government view the fuel price reduction and the Rs.10, 000 allowance for public servants as economically unwise decisions. What do you feel?

There are such views. There is a view that we should have given this pay hike in steps. All in all, we lived up to what we promised to the people during the election time. We did not disregard our election promises after assuming office. We enacted the Right to Information Act. Even the United States says it is one of the best pieces of legislations in the world. We did a whole lot of development work. But, there was scant propaganda for it. The previous government managed to have a publicity blitz for what they did. Yet, we failed in this exercise. We need to carry out propaganda work. Ours is the only government that gave a nutrition package for expectant mothers. We introduced Suraksha insurance scheme for school children. If it had been done by the previous government, they would have won the hearts and minds of parents and children alike. But, our government did not have that ability in terms of propaganda for what it did.   

 

Again, some people believe that the enactment of the Right to Information Act only facilitated dissent against the government to be published in media. They say media freedom was too much. What is your view?

It is viewed from different angles. From the peoples’ point of view , it is a commendable move. People have the right to know what is happening. It is a unique feature of democracy. We need such laws to root out corruption and frauds from society. I tried hard to bring it. I struggled for it even when I was in the opposition. The then government scuttled our move. It was anathema for the previous rule. Yet, the President and the Prime Minister brought this law fearlessly.   

 

If you say the government did so much, why was it defeated at the local government elections on February 10, 2018?

We did a lot of work. Alongside, there were shortcomings which the people felt.   

 


All MPs have to incur blame unnecessarily


 

What are those shortcomings?
After the defeat, we had a review meeting to ascertain the reasons for the defeat. One is the failure to deliver fertilizer on time for the farming community. It is a serious matter for people living in the agriculture areas. People voted against the government as a result.   

Secondly, there were a whole lot of people denied of Samurdhi benefits due to political reasons. These people wanted us to ensure such benefits for them. We could not address it. We have got the Ministry now. We are acting to give such benefits to people who were discriminated due to political reasons. These are deserving people.   

 

What do you think of the electoral impact of the government’s way of dealing with the UNHRC in Geneva?

We successfully faced the UNHRC process in Geneva as a country. We fared well in the international arena. Our country had been portrayed in negative light internationally. We changed the situation. We won over the international community. We were entangled in a messy situation in Geneva. We untangled it. There was the talk of an electric chair to execute the leaders of this country. There is no such talk today. Internationally, we are back in action with all the stakeholders.  At the last local polls, we received a signal from the people to correct our path. I am happy that we got it in advance. We have to read this message properly.   

 

There is a Presidential Election scheduled for the end of next year. How does the UNP look to it?

Internally, the UNP discussed that the party should field its own candidate. That is the general situation. We will reveal the identity of the candidate when the election is declared. The Working Committee of the party has always been used to announcing it only after the elections are announced. 

 


Candidate’s identity will be revealed only after the election is announced 


 

However, the party’s General Secretary Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said the Prime Minister would be the candidate. What is your view?

There are instances where the Ministers make such remarks. Normally, our party is used to announcing the candidate only after the election is declared.   

 

It is widely perceived today that former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa will be the candidate from the other side. What do you think of his candidacy?

It is advantageous for us if he comes forward as the candidate. The minority communities are strongly opposed to him. Likewise, people fear militarization under him. People respect the military for defeating terrorism. However, they have second thoughts on electing military personnel to govern the country. People respected former Army Commander Sarath Fonseka for his role in the elimination of terrorism. Yet, they were not ready to elect him to presidency.   

 

Have you started political work in view of the presidential elections?
We have started some work after the latest reforms. There is a special politburo appointed. I was elected to it. Once a week we meet with the Prime Minister. The key office bearers are also present at such meetings. We discuss certain things there. We believe we can do a whole lot of things. We cannot transform a party within a day or two. We have ample time. During that time, we can correct ourselves. It will not be difficult for us to win the next elections. If you put together the votes polled at the local polls by the parties that were together at the presidential election, it was much higher than the number polled by Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP).   

At a presidential election, it will be advantageous for us as a result.   

 

In the name of reforms, we saw a change of certain office bearers. Do you believe the party should undergo policy reforms?

Yes, of course. I believe even the party constitution should be changed. There were committees of back-benchers appointed to make recommendations on reforms. These recommendations should be taken into account.   

 

Realistically speaking, is it possible for you to unite the parties which were once together at the presidential election?

As for the local government elections, it is more or less the same results we have got.

 

At the presidential election, President Sirisena and the UNP were together. Now, there is animosity between the two. What is your view?

Only a handful of the SLFP backed us at the presidential elections. It is miniscule. There is enough time for us to get ready for the next election. In politics, even one day is a long period. At the local polls, it was a protest vote. We have got a message to correct ourselves. That is it. People expected us to punish those involved in corruption and frauds. We got a mandate for it.   

 


If Gota comes forward as candidate, it will be good for us


 

Yet, under the very same government, there was the bond scam. What do you feel about this scam that came out with evidence? 

I have no understanding about those responsible for it. We have only the information we got from the media. It is a huge black mark on the government. The opposition also played it up. If there is any fraud under whatever government, it has to be investigated. Our government did not try to sweep it under the carpet. The Presidential Commission was appointed. The Prime Minister also discussed it. He gave evidence before the Commission. The Commission appreciated it. In that context, we are happy.   

Politics has been relegated to the lowest ebb because of the latest findings with regard to the bond scam.   

 

Minister Dilan Perera has called Parliament ‘Arjuna Aloysius and Company”. You are the Chief Government Whip. What do you feel about it?

There are allegations at the moment. It is better to reveal those responsible rather than keeping on making mere allegations. Otherwise, people are suspicious of MPs who are actually innocent in this case.
