Two security officers at the Kuliyapitiya bus stand had grown suspicious after seeing the girl loitering near the public toilet and had kept an eye till she come out. After noticing that the girl had changed out of her school uniform into coloured clothing, they had detained her and informed the police about their suspicions.
