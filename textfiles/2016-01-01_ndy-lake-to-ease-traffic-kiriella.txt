Higher Education and Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella said yesterday steps would be taken to construct a bridge across the Kandy Lake to ease the movement of traffic in the Kandy City.
He conveyed this information to the media after accompanying President Maithripala Sirisena on a visit to the Asgiriya Mahanayake Thera on Thursday evening.
Responding to questions asked by journalists, the minister said the Government would implement a traffic plan to ease traffic just like he had successfully completed the surface carpeting of 60 roads in Kandy.
He said the Colombo-Kandy Expressway would begin from Kandy and that the development of Kandy was now receiving high priority. The minister said these programmes would begin this month and accused the previous regime of treating Kandy District in an off-handed manner. (J.A.L. Jayasinghe)
