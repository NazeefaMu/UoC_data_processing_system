He made a killing from the office shift!


	



 

A provincial political high-up has spent a record Rs. 3.3 million on the haulage of part of his files and furniture to his new office located only 10 km away. 

 


There are many smaller bodies coming under the purview of the Provincial authority, which this high-up presides over and most of these bodies own lorries and trucks. But the high-up had hired a private transport agency to move the stuff to his office at this massive cost, informed sources say.


By the way, his staff members themselves had to take their computers to the new office, they say.
