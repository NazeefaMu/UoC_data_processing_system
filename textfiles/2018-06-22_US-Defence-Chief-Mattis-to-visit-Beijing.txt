US Defence Chief  Mattis to visit Beijing


	

China, (South China Morning Post), 21 June, 2018 -  China and the US are moving to contain military tensions and the risk of misjudgment, with US Secretary of Defence Mattis heading for Beijing next week.  


The visit comes after Mattis this month rebuked Beijing for its military build-up in the South China Sea amid worsening ties between the two nations, and analysts say both sides recognise the need to step up communication to avoid the situation getting out of control.   Mattis announced on Wednesday that he would go to Beijing next week before travelling to Seoul. Pentagon spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Christopher Logan confirmed the visit, adding that details would be released on Friday.  


He is making the trip after military ties between the two sides rapidly deteriorated in the past months over Taiwan and the South China Sea.  


The US has said it would challenge China’s militarisation of disputed features it has built in the South China Sea, and help improve the self-defence capabilities of Taiwan, around which Beijing has recently stepped up military drills.
