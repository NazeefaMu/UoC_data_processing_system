Former minister Johnston Fernando today alleged that the current government had sold the Sri Lanka Institute of Information Technology (SLIIT) which was worth about Rs. 10 billion for a mere Rs.400 million without calling for tenders or without Cabinet approval.
He revealed this to the media when he reported to the Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID) to give a statement over an incident with regard to the Mahapola Lottery.
Mr. Fernando said the selling of the SLIIT was a great loss to the country as it a yielded huge income which could have been used to grant the Mahapola scholarship to university students.
He accused the government of conducting a witch-hunt on opposition MPs who were talking against the government rather than focusing on developing the country or its economy.
“The cost of living is skyrocketing, the economy is deteriorating, the administration has fallen apart and anarchy has caught on,” Mr. Fernando said and added that the people had made a huge mistake by electing the current government and were now suffering the consequences. (Ajith Siriwardana)
