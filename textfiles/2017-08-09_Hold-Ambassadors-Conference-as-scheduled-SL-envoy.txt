Sri Lankan Ambassador to Qatar A.S.P. Liyanage requested the President and Prime Minister to hold the Ambassadors' Conference scheduled this month despite the no confidence motion brought against Foreign Minister Ravi Karunanayake.

Speaking to the Daily Mirror, Ambassador Liyanage said the country’s diplomatic mission should continue despite political turmoil.

“The Ambassadors' Conference was scheduled to be held on August 28 and 29 in Sri Lanka and we have already informed emissaries about the event. Although the venue is yet to be finalised, initial arrangements for the event have been made,” he said.

The conference would allow ambassadors to collectively discuss diplomatic trends and plan out their future missions.

“There maybe allegations levelled against Minister Karunanayake, but he is someone who has good diplomatic ties with foreign countries. He travelled to Qatar during the crisis to ensure the safety of Sri Lankan expatriates,” the ambassador said.

However, when contacted the Foreign Affairs Ministry, the Daily Mirror was told its officials were yet to schedule a date convenient for the President, Prime Minister and other high ranking officials to participate in the event.(Darshana Sanjeewa)
