The Sri Lankan-born doctor, who bludgeoned her sleeping husband to death with a mallet in Geraldton after years of abuse, will not apply for parole because she fears being taken into immigration detention, ABC news reported on Tuesday.
Chamari Liyanage, 36, is serving a four-year prison term in Greenough Prison after being convicted of the manslaughter of fellow doctor Dinendra Athukorala at their home in June 2014.
She was acquitted of the more serious charge of murder. Liyanage's appeal is expected to be heard in the Supreme Court as early as November.
Her lawyer George Giudice said she would not be applying for release because of her uncertain fate.
"She doesn't want to apply for parole because apparently they will put her in an immigration detention centre," he said.
Liyanage has been eligible to apply for parole since June. During her trial, the court heard the couple's five-year marriage was defined by the "worst kind" of escalating sexual, physical and emotional abuse.

Israeli woman returned from SL with baby kept over maternity test
	
An Israeli woman and a baby who returned from Sri Lanka have been kept at Tel Aviv airport since Saturday amid questions over the child's origins.
The woman, Galit Nakash, is to take a DNA test to determine if the girl is her biological daughter, following a court hearing.
If the results are negative, authorities say they will return the child to Sri Lanka straight away.
Ms Nakash was stopped when airport officials found she had used another child's passport to leave Sri Lanka.
She says she gave birth at a hospital in Sri Lanka during a business trip but that her visa application for the baby, named Tahel, was turned down.
On Tuesday a court in Tel Aviv accepted her request to undergo a DNA test in Israel.
Ms Nakash's lawyer, Matan Hodorov, said his client and the one-year-old child are being moved to a facility at Ayalon prison in Ramle until the results of the test are known on Friday.
Mr Hodorov said Ms Nakash, 49, turned down an Israeli request to take a DNA test while she was in Sri Lanka because she did not trust the process there.
He said when Ms Nakash, who runs an export business and comes from Tel Aviv, re-entered Israel, the passport she used for Tahel carried the name of a different child.
However he said he was "confident the DNA test will prove Galit is the mother [of Tahel].
"We have all the correct medical documents from the hospital in Sri Lanka where she was born," he told the BBC.
The Israeli foreign ministry said Ms Nakash was denied a visa for Tahel because officials had doubts about her story.
"There were a few indications which raised a certain amount of suspicion," spokesman Emmanuel Nahshon said. "That is why we did not allow the child and Galit to enter the State of Israel.
"It doesn't mean she is wrong but we have a legal duty to check it out. If the DNA tests show she's the mother then that's wonderful and the problem is over. If not, the child will immediately be sent back to where she came from, as required under the Hague Convention [on child abduction]," Mr Nahshon said.
"Nobody is trying to take the child away or create a tragedy, but the circumstances are extremely suspicious," he said.

Job threat in Saudi: Govt. considering other options
	
The Sri Lankan government is considering alternative economies of other countries instead of Saudi Arabia where the most number of Sri Lankan migrant workers are currently employed in.
The decision was made by Foreign Employment Minister Thalatha Athukorala due to fears of Sri Lankan migrant workers losing their jobs as a result of the current economic crisis faced by Saudi Arabia.
With the fall of fuel prices, an economic crisis occurred in the Saudi Arabian economy. Subsequently, the number of foreign workers who migrated to Saudi was going down. However, instead of Saudi Arabia, we will be looking at other options,
The Minister said she was hopeful that a better economy could be found by the Sri Lankan government.
She assured that Sri Lankan migrant workers would not be affected by the economic crisis in Saudi.
However, twelve Sri Lankans who had been working in Saad Trading Company in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia have already lost their jobs and they are yet to return to the country.
Meanwhile, some 100 Sri Lankans who were working in Saudi Oger Company are facing a risk of losing their jobs.
The Sri Lankan government is yet to take action on behalf of the 100 Sri Lankans. (Piyumi Fonseka)

In the wake of the Supreme Court's announcement on the Value Added Tax (Amendment) Bill, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said legislation had been enacted in a similar manner by previous parliaments and requested the Speaker to rule on this matter for future legislative work.
He said though he was aggrieved by the ruling, he would not call for the impeachment of the Chief Justice. He said the rule of law had been established under the government founded on principles of good governance and therefore one could at least seek redress from court.
The Prime Minister said there seemed to be a deviation in this instance. He said it was against the ruling given by former Speaker Anura Bandaranaike who upheld the supremacy of Parliament.
However, he said the government would introduce fresh legislation in this respect in conformity with the Supreme Court's ruling.
"I do not intend to create a conflict in this regard," the Prime Minister said.
He said he was compiling details about the laws adopted in a similar manner and pointed out that it was a matter for Parliament to determine whether Cabinet approval had been secured for a particular Bill under Standing Order 133.
The Prime Minister said the ministers had acted in the past without notifying the House .
The Speaker said he would study the matter in consultation with the party leaders and give his ruling. (Kelum Bandara)

The Thera said not only the Buddhists even the foreigners who attend the Kandy Perahera are worried about the reduced number of elephants taking part in the perahera. He urged the President and the Prime Minister to make available a sufficient number of elephants for the historic pageant.
Diyawadana Nilame Pradeep Nilanga Dela and Basnayaka Nilames Gemunu Walisundera, Hemantha Bandara Herath, Gayan Heenkenda and DIG Mahinda Ekanayake spoke to the protesters at the Maha Maluwa and pleaded with monks to stop the protest and laeve the Maluwa peacefully.
"The Kandy Perahera is part of the Buddhist national heritage. Significance of the perahera is lost without a sufficient number of elephants at the perahera. FCID and CID are responsible for this situation. We would be compelled to move out all the mahouts from the perahera if sufficient number of elephants were not provided before the Randoli Perahera," Ven. Sudantha Thera said.
The Diyawadana Nilame pleaded with the monks to give their support to conduct the perahera successfully and to leave the Maha Maluwa.
The Central Province DIG said there is a court order banning demonstrations at the Maha Maluwa and requested the protesters to quit the premises.
Protesters asked for a written assurance from President before ending the protest.

The Supreme Court said today that the due constitutional procedure and the parliamentary Standing Orders had not been followed when presenting the Value Added Tax (Amendment) Bill and as such the entire process had been nullified.
The SC announcement was communicated to Parliament by Speaker Karu Jayasuriya. The Court said a determination on the constitutionality of the bill could not be made on the grounds of the challenge raised by the petitioners one of whom was JO MP Sisira Jayakody. The court says the provisions contained in Article 152 of the Constitution and Standing Order 133 are imperative, and the failure to follow them had nullified the subsequent proceedings.
Article 152 says,"No bill or motion, authorising the disposal of or imposition of the charges upon the Consolidated Fund or other funds of the Republic or the imposition of any tax of the repeal, augmentation or reduction of any tax for the time being in force shall be introduced in Parliament except by a Minister, and unless such a Bill or motion has been approved either by the Cabinet of Ministers or in such manner as the Cabinet of Ministers may authorise."
Article 78(2) of the Constitution says the passing of a Bill should be done in accordance with Standing Orders. Standing Order 133 stipulates that the introduction of a Bill should signify to Parliament the approval of the Cabinet.
JO MPs thumped their desks when the Speaker read out the announcement. (Kelum Bandara)

SL asylum seeker imprisoned in Czech Republic
	
A Sri Lankan man arrived in Prague, the Capital of Czech Republic, last year to seek asylum had been sentenced for abusing someone else's passport, Daily Hospodarske Noviny (HN) had reported on Monday.
According to a news article published on the Prague Daily Monitor, the 28-year-old Sri Lankan is staying in the Prague-Pankrac prison after he was arrested by the Czech police.
"He was punished for having arrived using a passport of another man, an Indian. He also used a forged Schengen entry stamp. However, from the beginning he has made it clear that he is a refugee and wants to apply for asylum," the suspect's lawyer Eva Hola was quoted as saying.
According to lawyers, it is extremely tough to imprison a man for using another person's passport and having a single faked stamp, mainly if he is a refugee, HN writes.
"We have enough evidence to trust him...He repeatedly presents details that cannot be known to anyone except those who experienced such situations. Moreover, his testimony corresponds to the testimonies of other people coming from Sri Lanka," said Hola.
The Sri Lankan had applied for Czech asylum immediately after arriving at the Prague airport, but the police ignored his request and no one dealt with his life story. "Finally he could apply for asylum from prison in March, with our assistance," Hola said.
The judge, in her verdict, said the accused had forged his documents with a clear intention to reach France. "In this context, his assertion about his alleged persecution looks very untrustworthy. If he really had faced persecution, he would have presented his genuine identity at the Czech customs checks," the judge said.
However, Hana Frankova, lawyer from the Czech Organisation for Aid to Refugees (OPU), said the suspect's story is quite trustworthy.

SLC invites Murali for awards ceremony
	
Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) Board has invited their former off-spinner Muttiah Muralitharan for the prize distribution ceremony after the completion of the third and final Test against Australia.
This was revealed by the president Thilanga Sumathipala. Speaking exclusively over his mobile from Colombo, he said, I have asked the secretary Mohan de Silva to invite Murali to give away the awards on the last day of the final Test match. The dead-rubber Test will be played at the Sinhalese Sports Ground in Colombo from August 13 and 17. Murali is welcome to witness the entire Test or at least we want him to remain present on the last day of the match on August 17 or on the day, if the Test finishes early, he added.
The Test series between Sri Lanka and Australia is played for Warne-Murali Trophy since the last 10 years. The trophy features the two bowlers right hands and matchused cricket balls bowled by them during their long cricketing careers.
Later, speaking exclusively again, the secretary Mohan de Silva said, the letter to Murali is being sent today (Monday).
We dont have a regular practice to invite former players to watch the matches.
However, if the request comes from any player, we do provide him the complimentary passes. So far, we have not received any such request from Muralitharan.
It will be interesting to see how the worlds highest Test wicket taker Murali would respond to the invitation. The 44-year-old ex-spinner was in the news when he had undertaken the coaching role for the visiting Australian team before the commencement of the series. My husband remains very busy in his business (Cane Manufacturing) and has not gone to watch the matches since he retired from Test cricket, Muralis Indian-wife, Madhi, said to this reporter recently.
Shane Warne, the other player of the trophy, is not be coming for the final Test, confirmed the secretary. We have not received any such request either from Warne or from the Cricket Australia (CA) and we presume Warne would not be arriving, he signed off. (Bipini Dani)

The minister or the SG had blundered: Dinesh
	
Joint opposition parliamentary group leader Dinesh Gunawardane said today either the Subject Minister or the Parliament Secretary General had blundered when presenting the Value Added Tax (VAT) Amendment Bill without following the proper procedure.
Mr. Gunawardane expressed his views after the Speaker read out the Supreme Court determination and said the Constitution stipulated the procedure to be followed.
He said the Cabinet should endorse the Bill and that decision should be communicated to the House before its presented.
Mr . Gunawardane said it was the responsibility of the minister or Parliament Secretary General to ensure that the Cabinet approval was notified to the House.
He recalled how former minister A. T. Adikari was stripped of his portfolio because of such a mistake he had done during the tenure of former president R. Premadasa.
"Financial Bills are serious matters as we all know," he said. (Kelum Bandara)
