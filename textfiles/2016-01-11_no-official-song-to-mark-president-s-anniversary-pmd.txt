President’s Secretary P.B. Abeykoon today said that there was no official song released by the President’s Secretariat or other responsible entities to mark the one year anniversary of democratic governance under the leadership of President Maithripala Sirisena.
Mr. Abeykoon said that a song titled “Nuba Ape Minisek” erroneously claimed that it was the President’s Official Song for 2016.
“This song has been played by some social networking websites without the permission of the President as well as the Presidential Secretariat,” he said.
