The Cabinet has approved an amendment to the Penal Code by including strict laws to take action against those who engage in hate speech that would result in communal, religious and ethnic disharmony.
The amendment was submitted by Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe in keeping with the recommendations made by the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission (LLRC).
Cabinet Spokesman and Minister Rajitha Senaratne said today the amendment which bans hate speech was essential for peaceful co-existence and political consensus.
“In the recent past there have been speeches which promoted religious extremism. Such an amendment has been recommended by the (LLRC),” he told the weekly Cabinet news briefing.
The Penal Code, when amended by the Legal Draughtsman will be published in the government gazette and presented in Parliament for approval and enactment. (Lahiru Pothmulla)WATCH
