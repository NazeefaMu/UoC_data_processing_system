SLMC to support a stable Govt.


	

The Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC) said today it would only support a stable government which commanded a comfortable majority in Parliament.

SLMC leader and Minister, Rauff Hakeem said the need of the hour was a stable government with a comfortable majority.

“It is not advisable for anyone to form a minority government neither should there be a situation where one party directs another by way of a remote control," he said when recalling the political crisis that arose when he was removed from the Cabinet in 2001 and ended up in the opposition.

The minister urged the country's political leaders to form a stable government in line with the mandate they have received from the people.

“The people may sense there is political crisis in the country if the leaders do not ensure stability," he said. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)
