Jaipur, (Hindustan Times), Apr 20, 2017 -  
A group of Kashmiri students at a private university in Rajasthan were on Wednesday allegedly called terrorists and beaten up by locals, upset over soldiers being targeted by stone-throwers in the strife-torn border state.   


The assault is the latest incident of violence against Kashmiris studying at Chittorgarh’s Mewar University, which has around 500 students from Jammu and Kashmir.   


“Six of us were assaulted in three separate attacks that took place at the same time in the market. The attacks seemed coordinated,” said Bahar Ahmed Giri, a student of pharmacy.  


Though no one suffered serious injuries, students are upset with the university administration for failing to protect them and have demanded the arrest of the offenders.  


They were beaten up for no reason, Giri said. “They hurled abuses, called us terrorists and said we throw stones at the army. They told us to go back to Kashmir and threatened that they won’t let us study here,” he said.
