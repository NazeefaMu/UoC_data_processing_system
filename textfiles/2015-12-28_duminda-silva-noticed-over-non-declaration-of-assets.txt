The Colombo Chief Magistrate's Court today noticed former UPFA parliamentarian Duminda Silva to appear in Court on January 13 on charges of non-declaration of assets in 2011, 2012 and 2013.
The Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption filed the lawsuit.
The Commission’s report filed in Court states that Mr. Silva had violated Section 3 of the Bribery Commission Act by not declaring his assets for the three years and had committed an offence punishable under Section 9 of the Bribery Act. (T. Farook Thajudeen)
