The budget proposal to remove excise duty on canned beer was not taken with the intention to promote beer in the country, the United National Party (UNP) said today.

It said the proposal envisages to put in place a formula to introduce taxes on alcoholic beverages based on their alcohol volume, which is the international standard.

“The government previously increased the prices of alcohol. This time, the government had introduced a formula to streamline taxes on alcoholic beverages. Illicit alcoholic beverages such as moonshine cause serious health complications. Even the Health Minister had admitted to spending large amount of money for the treatment of people with such complications,” UNP Deputy Minister Ajith P. Perera told a news briefing.

He said the debate on alcohol-whether it is good or bad-was not anew but he won’t back alcohol as someone who doesn’t consume them.

“However, I respect others choices,” he said. From the Budget 2018, the Finance Minister proposed to introduce an alcohol volume based Excise Duty depending on the type of liquor for hard liquor, beer and wine. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
