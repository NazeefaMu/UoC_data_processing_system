Remembering Donald


	

The Lord saw you getting tired  
And a cure was not to be  
So He put his arms around you  
And whispered “Come with me”  
With tearful eyes, we watched you suffer  
And saw you fade away,  
Although we loved you dearly,  
We could not make you stay.  
A golden heart stopped beating,  
A beautiful smile at rest,  
God broke our hearts to prove  
He only takes the best.  
Each time we see your picture,  
You seem to smile and say,  
“Don’t cry, I ‘m in God’s keeping,  
We’ll meet again someday”  
Family member’s who 
loved you dearly
