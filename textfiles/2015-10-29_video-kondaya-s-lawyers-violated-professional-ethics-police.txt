Police Spokesman ASP Ruwan Gunasekara yesterday said that they would file a lawsuit in the Supreme Court against lawyers Udul Premaratne and two others for spreading malicious lies, violating the ethics guiding the law profession.
Referring to statements made by the three lawyers, including Mr. Premaratne against the police, CID and the police spokesman in defence of Dunesh Priyashantha alias ‘Kondaya,’ ASP Gunasekara said the police were having discussions on whether to proceed with legal action against them.
“No lawyer can influence or force a person to file lawsuits in court according to the laws and regulations of the Supreme Court. Mr. Premaratne has claimed that 'Kondaya' had made a statement to the Negombo Magistrate about several assaults inflicted on him by the police, which is not true. 'Kondaya' was never produced in the Negombo Magistrate’s Court. Mr. Premaratne is engaged in a media stunt,” he told a news conference yesterday.
He said bringing Kondaya to media conferences was unacceptable and that holding news conferences with those who have committed crime would set a bad precedent. He pointed out that Mr. Premaratne had claimed that there were no criminal charges or cases, inclusive of child abuse cases, against Kondaya.
“In 2010, two cases were filed against the suspect for attempting to abduct a 15-year-old girl after forcibly entering a house in Bemmulla. However, he had been found guilty in 2013 and was sentenced to 20 months imprisonment, suspended for five years,” he said.
ASP Gunasekara said anyone can go to the Human Rights Commission or complain to the Independent Police Commission. However, it was not acceptable to white wash someone who had committed such crimes, he said. (Darshana Sanjeewa)
