Deans of the medical faculties of eight universities today had a discussion with Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne on the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM), Ministry sources said.

Health Ministry Spokesman Nipun Ekanayake said the deans agreed to submit a report on the standard of the SAITM and their proposals and recommendations in two weeks.

They had earlier written to Higher Education Minister Lakshman Kiriella outlining suggestions to resolve the issue involving the SAITM, Malabe and the standard of the medical education in the country, where they stressed the need to mete out justice to the students currently studying at the SAITM.
