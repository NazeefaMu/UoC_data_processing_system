Canada passes Bill calling for Tamil Heritage Month
	
Canada yesterday officially declared that it will celebrate the culture of its Tamil population each January.
Passing Motion M-24, the Canadian Parliament voted to designate January as Tamil Heritage Month, to recognize the contributions that Tamil-Canadians have made to Canadian society, the richness of Tamil language and culture, and the importance of educating and reflecting upon Tamil heritage for future generations by declaring January, every year, Tamil Heritage Month.
The motion, introduced by Gary Anandasangaree, Member of Parliament for Scarborough-Rouge Park, earlier in the year, was debated on May 20 and on September 29, before being passed on October 5.
This is a historical milestone that recognizes the incredible contributions of Tamil-Canadians to our society and the richness of the language, heritage and culture from coast to coast to coast stated Anandasangaree, according to a news statement on his website.
This decision by the Canadian Parliament comes after various municipalities including Mississauga, Durham, Ottawa, Toronto, Markham, Ajax and Pickering, as well as the Toronto District School Board and Province of Ontario, had previously declared January as Tamil Heritage Month.
Receiving 283 Yea votes, the motion was supported across party lines. Passing this motion crossed partisan lines and is a result of the collective advocacy and contributions of many organizations, community leaders and politicians of all stripes and all levels of government throughout the years. It is a testament to our collective and united effort in achieving this important goal.
January was reportedly chosen as the ideal month to celebrate Tamil heritage as the harvest festival, Pongal, is celebrated in this month. 
According to Tamil Culture, an online publication catering to the global Tamil community, while the 2006 Canadian census pegs the population of Tamils at 138,130, estimates from within the community are higher at between 200,000 to 300,000 people. (thenewsminute.com)

I have a suspicion about Gotabaya -- Hirunika
	
Government MP Hirunika Premachandra alleged todaythat former defence secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa gave all forms of protection to the person convicted of the murder of her father Bharatha Lakshman Premachandra after the crime, and, therefore, she had her doubts about the incident .
I cannot pinpoint anyone without evidence. Yet I have doubts because the killer received protection after the crime, she said.
She was speaking to the media after the fifth year death commemoration of her father. She said former MP Duminda Silva, who was convicted of Premachandra's murder, had no deep-seated issues with her father to kill him.
She said her fathers stance on several illegal activities taking place in the Kolonnawa electorate had created differences between him and Mr. Silva. Her father had complained against the activities of the former parliamentarian which had led to a feud between the two.
Government ministers paid their last respects to my father. Yet Mr. Gotabaya Rajapaksa did not attend the funeral. Instead, he visited Duminda Silva at Sri Jayewardenepura Hospital. Later arraignment were made to send him for treatment to Singapore, she said.
She said the CID had initiated a fresh investigation and it was better to clear all doubts .

Chairman of the Northern Provincial Council (NPC), C.V.K. Shivagnanam has requested the security provided to Chief Minister C.V. Vigneswaran be increased citing threats to his life.
Mr. Shivagnanam had made the request in writing to the IGP. The decision, he said was based on a statement made by the Chief Minister to the effect that racist groups based in the South were hatching plans to harm his life and blame previous LTTE cadres for the act.
Meanwhile, NPC member M. K. Shivajilingam said the Chief Minister had received more threats from southern racist groups after the Eluga Tamil demonstration.
At present, Chief Minister Vigneswaran has been provided with security similar to other Provincial Chief Ministers. (Romesh Madushanka)

Madras HC bans film on slain LTTE news presenter Isaipriya
	
The Madras High Court has upheld the decision of the Film Certificate Appellate Tribunal (FCAT) to deny certification to Bengaluru-based filmmaker K. Ganeshans Tamil film Porkalathil Oru Poo (A flower in a battlefield). The films script is based on the life of slain LTTE journalist Isaipriya, who was allegedly raped and killed by the Sri Lankan armed forces during the final stages of the civil war in 2009.
Originally, in May 2015, the Central Board for Film Certification had refused to clear the film for screening. Later, in August last year, the FCAT denied certification for the film holding that it was replete with terrorism, violence, sexual perversions and degradation of women, reflecting adversely on the Sri Lankan administration and army, and is therefore likely to affect the friendly relations with the island nation. This, after Mr. Ganeshan agreed to make some cuts and mute certain dialogues in the film.
The filmmaker moved the court challenging the FCATs decision. However, by an order dated September 29, Justice T.S. Sivagnanam has upheld the appellate tribunals decision.
Incidentally, Vetharanjani and Dharmini Vahisan, mother and sister of Isaipriya respectively, were also opposed to the release of the movie. Isaipriya has been portrayed as a militant. The theme of the movie is entirely based on family members and they are the characters in the film. It is petitioners own creation and imaginary commercial story and he has done so only for the personal gain, they had argued.
Ganeshan, who said that he was inspired to make a film about Isaipriya after he saw the Channel 4 documentary Sri Lankas Killing Fields, argued that his film was based on published facts. I tried a lot to make sure that Isaipriyas mother and sister watched the movie. I even went to England with the film; but it didnt happen, he claimed.
The filmmaker admitted that he was ready to make changes to ensure that the film was cleared. According to the suggestion made by the CBFC and FCAT, I reduced the duration of the sexual assault scenes in the climax by six minutes. They also wanted me to remove (Tamil Nadu Chief Minister) Jayalalithaas speech about a resolution related to Sri Lanka which runs for 18 seconds in the beginning of the film, which I didnt accept, he said.
I had even said that I will remove the claim based on true events and even change the names of the character. Still, it didnt work, Mr. Ganeshan added.(The Hindu)

We dont really care about small meetings and gatherings organized by the Joint Opposition because it is a normal phenomenon seen in an opposition party. President Maithripala Sirisena and I will never leave room for members to divide the party or leave it, Minister Samaraweera said at an event held in Angunkolapellessa today.
He was of the opinion that reportedly the number of those flocking around the Joint Opposition was now decreasing.

SL remains committed to UN Convention on Refugees: Aryasinha
	
Though the Government of Sri Lanka is not a party to the UN Convention on Refugees, Sri Lanka remains committed to work in coordination and cooperation with the UNHCR to address issues pertaining to asylum seekers in accordance with international norms Sri Lankas Permanent Representative to the UN Ravinatha Aryasinha said.
Addressing the 67th Session of the Executive Committee of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) on Saturday, he said the root causes of forced migrations should be addressed as well as meeting the immediate humanitarian needs of those who have been forced to migrate.
The unprecedented scale of large movements of refugees and migrants in recent times has often resulted in tragic stories of despair of the people forced to be on the move for safety and protection.
The numbers which include migrants, refugees, asylum seekers and internally displaced have now surpassed 65 million. Forced displacement of such magnitude is a matter of deep concern. Sri Lanka recognizes the important role performed by the UNHCR in striving to provide protection, assistance and durable solutions to these vulnerable populations, he said.
He said it was a collective responsibility of the countries to prevent human trafficking and related illegal activities that arise as a result of forced migration.
A single country or region is not in a position to overcome such crises successfully without the mutual assistance and cooperation of others. Solutions to address root causes need the continuous support and collaboration of the international community, he said.
He said, during the last 30 years, due to the internal armed conflict in Sri Lanka and other social, economic and political reasons, many of the people left the country.
The Government, under the leadership of President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has taken steps, since January 2015, to create safe, secure and conducive conditions for their return.
As of September, 582 Sri Lankan refugees (231 families) have returned to the country during this year, 2016, under UNHCRs facilitated Voluntary Repatriation Programme. The Government of Sri Lanka works closely with the UNHCR in this process, and is pleased that there is an increased interest in Sri Lankan refugees to return to the country, and the rate of return is higher than that of 2015, he said.
He said Sri Lanka is also a country of destination for people who have been displaced in neighboring countries.
Aryasinha said the issue of Statelessness has been comprehensively addressed by Sri Lanka through progressive legal and policy initiatives of successive governments.
Several amendments introduced to the Citizenship Act of Sri Lanka has addressed the statelessness among the community of Tamils of Indian Origin and as a result, the UNHCR has identified Sri Lanka as a case of good practice, stating that Sri Lanka presents one of the best examples of how legal and policy reform, combined with a citizenship campaign, can resolve a long-standing situation of statelessness in a short time, he said.
