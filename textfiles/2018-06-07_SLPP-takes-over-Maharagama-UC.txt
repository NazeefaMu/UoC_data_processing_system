The Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) list for the election to the Maharagama Urban Council was rejected but managed to get six of its members including former mayor Kanthi Kodikara nominated to the local body yesterday.

After the SLPP nomination list was rejected, the SLPP backed the independent group that contested the polls under the 'bicycle' symbol and won with the backing of former president Mahinda Rajapaksa. There was an agreement that its elected members would resign later making way for the nomination of SLPP members.

Six of its members resigned enabling the SLPP to nominate its members. Mrs. Kodikara who was the team leader of the SLPP was among them.

Her husband Western Province councillor Upali Kodikara told Daily Mirror the other 19 members elected under the bicycle symbol would resign in batches making way for the SLPP to take control of the Maharagama UC. (Kelum Bandara)
