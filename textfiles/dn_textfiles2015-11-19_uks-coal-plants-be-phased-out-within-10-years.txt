UK's coal plants to be phased out within 10 years

The UK's remaining coal-fired power stations will be shut by 2025 with their use restricted by 2023, Energy Secretary Amber Rudd has announced.
Unveiling the government's new energy strategy, Ms Rudd said that relying on “polluting” coal is “perverse”.
In a speech later today it is expected she will announce gas will become “central” to the UK's energy supply.
Environmental groups welcomed the move away from coal but criticised plans to focus on gas instead of renewables.
‘Safe and reliable'
Currently, coal provides almost a third (28%) of the UK's electricity, but Ms Rudd said “We are tackling a legacy of underinvestment and ageing power stations which we need to replace with alternatives that are reliable, good value for money and help to reduce emissions.”

Ms Rudd is also expected to say that investment in nuclear power is vital to the government's policy.
She believes that plans for new nuclear power stations, including at Wylfa in Wales and Moorside in Cumbria, could provide almost a third of the low carbon electricity the UK needs for the next 15 years.
“Opponents of nuclear misread the science. It is safe and reliable,” Ms Rudd will say.
The speech comes amid concerns that the UK could suffer from blackouts as a result of short supplies, brought about in large part from the closure of a number of power stations that have come to the end of their working lives.
However, National Grid and many experts have dismissed these concerns.

Successive governments have highlighted our energy dilemma - the need to keep the lights on, while cutting greenhouse gases and ensuring energy is affordable for consumers.
Today the Energy Secretary Amber Rudd will focus on energy security and keeping prices as low as possible.
But for the world's first industrialised nation to end coal-powered generation sends a strong signal ahead of the UN Climate summit in Paris.
All the major parties had signed up to phasing out coal. The previous government's projections saw it falling to 1% by 2025.
The big question is how to ensure gas plants are built to replace it. Only one large plant is under construction today. Another, which secured a subsidy last year, is struggling to find investors.
