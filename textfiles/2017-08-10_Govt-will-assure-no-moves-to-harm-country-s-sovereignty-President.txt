The policy of the ‘Yahapalana Government’ is to bring foreign investment in a way which will not harm the country’s sovereignty and dignity, President Maithripala Sirisena said.

The President also added that when entering into agreements with a foreign country or a company regarding investments, a special clause will be included stating that in any way land ownership is not assigned to anyone and only the necessities of a particular investment will be fulfilled.

President Sirisena made these remarks addressing an intellectual dialogue held at the BMICH to mark the 60th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Sri Lanka.

“When we develop as a country, the assistance of the economically powerful nations in the world is needed and the present government has been able to get the assistance of all these countries through a friendly and cordial foreign policy,” President Sirisena said.

‘This government has been able to avoid many negative impacts on Sri Lanka internationally during the past two and a half years and anyone can see today the benefits of the steps taken by the government to increase foreign exchange reserves and to reduce the foreign debt burden,” he stressed.

”We can celebrate the 60th anniversary of the establishment of the diplomatic relations between China and Sri Lanka in a happy and positive environment as a result of laying a solid foundation in the relations between the two countries during the past two and a half years and the present government is committed to further strengthen those relations,” President Sirisena added.

During this event, President Sirisena presented awards to the winners of the competitions held to mark the 60th anniversary of the diplomatic relations between China and Sri Lanka.

The President of the Sri Lanka-China Friendship Association Amaradasa Gunawardena presented the commemorative book issued to mark the 60th anniversary of the diplomatic relations between China and Sri Lanka, to the President.
