Japan, (Daily Mail), 23 January 2018 -  A Japanese soldier was killed on Tuesday after a volcano erupted near a popular Japanese ski resort, sparking an avalanche that left fifteen people injured and scores stranded up a mountain.  


Footage broadcast on Japanese television showed thick black smoke interspersed with falling rocks sliding down the snow-covered side of the volcano towards a ski slope.The ministry had earlier said that six infantry personnel who had been on a training mission on the mountain were hit by the avalanche but had been rescued.  ‘Black smoke rose from the top of the mountain and we were told to evacuate inside 30 minutes later,’ a man who was at the ski resort told public broadcaster NHK. 

 
The falling rocks kicked clouds of snow into the air as they made impact, officials said. A hundred people have evacuated.  


Japan’s Meteorological Agency urged nearby residents to stay away from Mt. Kusatsu Shirane.
