More rains can be expected over the island with the low pressure area in the Southern Bay of Bengal likely to intensify into a depression and move westwards, the Department of Meteorology said.

It advised fishermen not to venture out to sea off the coast extending from Mullaitivu to Mannar via Kankasanturai.

“Heavy rains of up to 150mm can be expected in some places in the Northern Province, particularly in the Western, Central, Sabaragamuwa and North-Western provinces and in the Galle and Matara districts,” the Met Department said.

Fairly strong winds of up to 50kmph can be expected over the Northern Province tomorrow while lightning and strong winds of up to 80kmph are also likely during thundershowers.

The Met Department requested people living in hilly areas (particularly in landslide-prone areas) to be vigilant and take adequate precautions to minimize damage caused by lightning activity.

Meanwhile, the highest rainfall of 90.9mm was reported in Mattala in the Hambantota district. (Sheain Fernandopulle)
