18 NCP councillors support JO


	

Eighteen UPFA members in North-Central Provincial Council (NCPC) are reported to have tilted towards the joint opposition.

A political crisis erupted in the council after K.H. Nandasena was removed from his ministerial portfolio and the subsequent resignation of Minister S.M. Ranjith from his portfolio in protest. The JO led by Mahinda Rajapaksa has the backing of 18 members while those loyal to President Maitripala Sirisena, the United National Party (UNP) and the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) total 15.

SLPP chairman G.L. Peiris said the situation was somewhat similar to what prevailed in the Southern Provincial Council in 1994. He said it was a game changer at the time. (Kelum Bandara)
