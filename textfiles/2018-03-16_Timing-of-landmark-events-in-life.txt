Timing of landmark events in life


	



 

When will I be able to marry? When will I be able to secure a permanent job? When Will I be able to move into a house of my own? When will I have the bliss of a child?


These are some of the commonplace questions that most people would ask an astrologer. We all have an insatiable curiosity and a desire to know what our future holds in store for us; to know in particular as to when certain landmark events in life we look forward to, are likely to occur. Therefore, timing of events has become an important part of Predictive Astrology.

A difficult task
In fact, timing of events is a more difficult and complicated task for an astrologer than delineating one’s character or assessing one’s potential -inherent power in a human being.


Timing of events is a task that calls for a correct assessment of the effects that the planets produce and an accurate determination as to when such effects materialize.


Astrologers rely on Dasas and concur rent transits of planets for predicting the times when the planets produce good or bad effects.


When a Dasa and a Bhukti (Antar Dasa) ruled by benefic planets are in operation, the native would’ enjoy comforts, luxuries, power and privileges and high status. When the periods ruled by malefics or evil planets are in operation, the native would experience hardship, suffering and misery. According to Indian Rishis, there are certain planetary combinations that produce Dhanayoga and Rajayoga which fructify during the Dasas of the planets involved in producing such favourable combinations. The 5th and the 9th Bhavas provide the clues to determine the fortune of a person. The 4th and the 10th Bhavas determine the happiness and the comforts in store for the native. The lords of the 4th, 5th, 9th and 10th Bhavas always produce good results during the Dasas and Bhuktis they rule. 

 

Career success 
A good job or a rise in career can be looked forward to in the Dasas of the 9th and 10th lords or those of the benefic planets occupying the 9th and 10th Bhavas at birth. When all the benefics are posited in the 3rd, 6th, 10th and the 11th Houses from the Ascendant or the Moon, a powerful Dhanayoga is produced and the results of this yoga would materialize during the Dasas of the lords of these Houses or those of their occupants. 

 

Timing of marriage 
A careful study of the 7th, 2nd and the 5th Houses, the position of Venus and the 7th House from Venus is imperative for determining all matters relating to marriage. The Karakas or significators for marriage are the Moon, Mercury, and Jupiter. These planets play an important role in timing of marriage. 


Marriage can take place in the Dasas of the planets in the 7th or of the 7th lord or of the planets aspecting the 7th or 2nd lord during the Bhuktis of these planets. 

 

Transits
When the Lagnadhipati transits the 7th House, especially when Jupiter or Saturn is the lord of the Ascendant, there is the possibility for the marriage to take place. Marriage can take place when Jupiter transits the Rashi occupied by Venus or the 5th or the 9th House from Venus. Jupiter passing through the 5th or the 9th from the 7th or the Rashi occupied by the Moon also signifies the possibility of marriage 

 

Sadesati or Shani Erashtaka
 Even the good results due in the Dasa periods of benefics can become ineffective when such periods coincide with a Shani Erashtaka. This holds good for combinations pointing to marital happiness as well.
