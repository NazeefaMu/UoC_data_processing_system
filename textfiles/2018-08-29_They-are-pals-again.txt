They are pals again!


	



 

The young Pohottuwa Diyawanna member from the ‘Tourist City’ in the Gampaha district had received an order from the party high command to look after the neighbouring ‘watte’ too in addition to his home turf.

 


However, Diyawanna member ‘Weere’ ruling the roost in Kelaniya, despite being a thick chum of the Tourist City man got highly upset over this arrangement as he had his own interests in the ‘Watte’ area.


So, he promptly went into action using his ties with some heavyweights in the party to stymie the order from the party high command.


A Pohottuwa high-up who learnt about Weere’s underhand move immediately sent for him and gave him a tongue lashing warning him to mind his own business.


Thus chastised, Weere has again begun moving closely with the Tourist City colleague as if nothing untoward had happened to sour their friendship, they say.
