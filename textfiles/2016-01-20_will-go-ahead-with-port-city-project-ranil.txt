The government has decided to go ahead with several Chinese funded infrastructural projects, including the Port City Project, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe told foreign journalists in Davos today.
“We are going ahead with Chinese funded projects, including the Port City and the next phase of the Hambantota Port. China is an economic power in Asia and is ready to work on some development projects in Sri Lanka,” he said.
He said Sri Lanka would like China to invest in other sectors, including real estate, and also play a role in developing Sri Lanka as a logistics hub.
He said discussions were being held with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) regarding contingency plans to face any adverse international situation. “No one knows what the international situation would be in 2016; and it is clear that Sri Lanka should gear up to face any situation. We are looking into the kind of arrangements we can make with the IMF,” he said; adding that he would meet the Managing Director of the IMF while in Davos.
Responding to a question by the foreign journalists on the reconciliation process, he said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was working out a plan concerning accountability. He said some lands occupied by the military had been handed back to the owners and more land would be handed back in the future. He said there were no political prisoners in Sri Lanka and those in prison had been tried and convicted.
