A Fundamental Rights petition was filed in the Supreme Court today by Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) leader Udaya Gammanpila requesting the Elections Commission (EC) to hold elections to the Sabaragamuwa, North Central and Eastern Provincial Councils without delay.

He told media that Article 78 of the Constitution had been violated by bringing amendments to the Provincial Councils Act.

“Filing the petition is a wake up call to the Elections Commission which is in a lethargic mode. We hope this will push the officials to hold PC polls,” Mr. Gammanpila said and added that the Attorney General and the Speaker were to blame for not calling a referendum on the PC Bill.

He proceeded to say that both the Attorney General and the Speaker were responsible. (Sheain Fernandopulle)
