Ketagoda says ready to forego parliamentary seat for SF


	

Parliamentarian Jayantha Ketagoda today said he had agreed to relinquish his Parliamentary seat to Democratic Front leader General (Rtd) Sarath Fonseka if the Elections Commissioner assured he would be the recipient of the seat.  
However, he said he would continue to support former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.
In a surprise move last year Ketagoda, who filled in the DF seat replacing Fonseka, pledged to support former president Rajapaksa at the Presidential Election.
Ketagoda said Fonseka’s Secretary had requested him to relinquish his seat after the Presidential Election.  
“I informed them that I would, but on the condition that the seat should be given to Sarath Fonseka and no one else. The Elections Commissioner should be able to provide a document in this regard,” he said.
The Parliamentarian said he would support Mahinda Rajapaksa, as promised when pledging his support last year.
“I have no plans to leave politics. However, I will inform the public of my decisions in the future,” Ketagoda said. (Darshana Sanjeewa)
