Having a UNP Dy Speaker violates National Govt. concept: JO


	

The Joint Opposition (JO) today said electing both the Speaker and the Deputy Speaker from the same political party-the United National Party-was against the principles of the National Government concept.

JO MP Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena said the basic agreement of the National Government was to appoint the Speaker from the UNP and the Deputy Speaker from the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP).

“Today it has been changed. Therefore, we request the Govt. to take off the so called ‘National Government’ label at least now, since there is no such thing today. Today, SLFP Ministers had become stakeholders of the UNP,” he told a news briefing. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
