Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) General Secretary Ven. Galagodaaththe Gnanasara Thera surrendered to the Fort Magistrate’s Court a short while ago.

Colombo Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne on Thursday issued an arrest warrant on the Thera after he failed to appear in court in connection with two ongoing cases.

Two cases were filed against the Thera for allegedly defaming the Quran and assaulting the organizers of the Jathika Bala Sena media conference held in 2014.
