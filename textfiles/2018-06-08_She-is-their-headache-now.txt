She is their headache now


	



 

A female white-collar high-up currently serving on secondment in a division handling matters relating to rights of the people at the august assembly has become a terror to the staff there, they say.

 


This female often found in an ugly mood would find some reason to harangue the staffers working under her, though it behooves her to conduct herself with some measure of decorum given her status. 


This high-up had been seconded for service at this division following an official request that a competent professional be assigned mainly for the purpose of assisting the Diyawanna politicos on legal issues relating to the protection of rights of the people. 


This female had reportedly been a headache to those at her original place of work as well, they say.
