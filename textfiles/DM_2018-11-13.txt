19A totally Nullified:  J.C. Weliamuna
	

Constitution a counter-majoritarian document
	Article 48 (1) doesnt say PM can be removed by President
	SLFP cannot form a national government

Politics has always been a messy game. It got even messier over the past few days. At a time when many debates, arguments and justifications are being brought up, one certainly wouldnt be able to distinguish between what is right and what is wrong. When many were looking forward to November 14, President Maithripala Sirisena dissolved Parliament last Friday -another trump card out of many as he said. A majority of those in the legal fraternity deem this move unconstitutional. Imagine a situation where in Parliament, the President and Mahinda Rajapaksa are unable to show a majority; it can then lead to what is known as a Constitutional deadlock, says J.C. Weliamuna, Presidents Counsel specialised in Constitutional and human rights law, in an interview with Daily mirror . Excerpts:

QThere have been several arguments over what was right and wrong in the sudden turn of events since October 26. What are your thoughts on this
There are multiple issues here. First is the removal of an existing Prime Minister and appointment of a new one. There are a lot of arguments to that move. Then surfaces the question whether prorogation is lawful or not -- leading up to a potential dissolution of Parliament. Lets take a look at the provisions; the basic fact regarding a Constitution is that it is not interpreted like normal laws. One cannot tamper with it and we need to find answers within the Constitutional framework. In the Constitution, unlike other laws, there is no provision to say that either Sinhala or Tamil clauses prevail. They have to look at the intention of the Parliament. The Constitution is a fundamental document that sets limits to power, which is why it is a counter-majoritarian document. If we say the Parliament has powers, it sets limits to Parliament. Otherwise, the Parliament can pass anything. This applies to the President as well. He has his powers and you need to look at the limitations.

The President can appoint a PM only if there is a vacancy and such a vacancy will occur only in terms of the provisions given or after an election. Under Article 47, the President can appoint a PM when theres a vacancy. During such an instance, he can form an opinion on who commands the majority
QAccording to 19A, where does the legality lie in the unfolding of such events
Many say the President was vested with enormous powers through the Constitution prior to the introduction of 19A. Article 47 says the President has the authority to remove the premier and Cabinet ministers. 19A was intended to shift away executive powers. Therefore, any interpretation will look at the amendment first. There is no provision and since Article 47 was altered, the President is now unable to change the PM. They also refer to Article 48 (1) in Sinhala which says the PM will be removed, but it doesnt say that the PM will be removed by the President. Even then, there is a procedure to remove the PM and that is not by the President because his powers are limited. The only instance where a PM can be removed -- which is termed an enabling provision -- is through a no-confidence motion in Parliament. If not, it has to be the court upon him ceasing to be a Member of Parliament (MP) through an election petition. Under the Constitution and according to Standing Orders, there is one more person who cannot be removed. That is the Speaker. Furthermore, a no-confidence motion cannot be brought against the Speaker because we have gone towards Parliamentary traditions, moving away from Presidential systems.
QSome claim that since the SLFP left the Cabinet, the PM ceased to exist. Is that true
There has to be 30 members in the Cabinet with the President and if there is a national government, the numbers may increase. When the SLFP withdrew from the national government, the Cabinet ceased to exist and the Parliament has to be dissolved. Once again, this is similar, because the Constitution states how a Cabinet is dissolved. This is when the PM resigns and even with the dissolution of Parliament, the Cabinet may continue to function. The provision caters to the party that musters a majority to accommodate as many people in the Cabinet. In fact, it is quite an unhealthy provision. It doesnt get members together to run the country. The Cabinet will be expanded so that people wont jump here and there and they will be accommodated. It is the party which gets the highest number that can form a national government. Presently, it is the UNP. The SLFP cannot form a national government. In order to form a national government, there has to be a resolution passed in Parliament. Only then can the President appoint more than 30 members. When you increase the count to more than 30, you dont have to replace the PM. It is the same equation when you reduce the count. The national government concept is only for the size of the Cabinet. That has nothing to do with the Presidents power to remove the PM. They are totally independent. The President can appoint a PM only if there is a vacancy and such a vacancy will occur only in terms of the provisions given or after an election. Under Article 47, the President can appoint a PM when theres a vacancy. During such an instance, he can form an opinion on who commands the majority. This happens in two ways in Commonwealth countries -- you either consult the parties and the party that garners the highest number will appoint whoever it considers to the post. If the decision is challenged, a Floor Test will be held to show a majority and then you are appointed. Once appointed, the executive ceases to have any authority for interference and this applies to any executive anywhere in the world. This is the Constitutional change envisaged in 19A. If you want to have Parliamentary traditions, this is how it should happen. Otherwise, we are going back to the epoch pre-19A.
QCan this process be reversed
This process has totally nullified 19A and it is unconstitutional. It is now difficult to redo it and even if you show a majority, this unconstitutional step will create a historic precedence and ultimately affect the populace. Imagine a situation where in Parliament, the President and Mahinda Rajapaksa are unable to show a majority; it can then lead to what is known as a Constitutional deadlock. Such deadlocks will be resolved militarily or by bloodshed. In order to get over that, the government will have to resort to many other unconstitutional steps. If the President wants to respect the peoples mandate and the Constitution, he has to give in.

Article 99 (13) has been over-interpreted by the Supreme Court in many rulings. I cannot say if it is right or wrong, but we ended up in a situation where MPs can crossover to any side. If you want to jump into a party that is in power, you can strengthen their hands. Its the partys decision that is challenged
QDoes it leave room for dissolution of Parliament
The power vested with the President to dissolve Parliament should be incorporated in the Constitution. One reason why 19A was brought in was to limit presidential powers. Earlier, the President had the authority to dissolve Parliament of his own accord after one year. This was changed in Article 70 and it now states that the President may proclaim, summon, prorogue or dissolve Parliament, provided that the President shall not dissolve Parliament until expiration of a period not less than four years and six months. So he cannot dissolve Parliament unless it requests the President to do so with a two-thirds majority (150 MPs). The argument is that Article 70 (1) and 33 (c) vests general powers with the President to dissolve Parliament but sets limitations as aforementioned. The dissolution of Parliament is a clear indication that the government wants to keep covering the initial illegality.
QWhat exactly are the Presidents powers
Article 33 lists out the Presidents powers. These include presiding ceremonies and summoning, proroguing or dissolving Parliament. Although he has a general power when there are specific limitations, you cant say that one part is valid and other part is not. Previously, there were decisions on 19A in the Supreme Court, but all of them were nullified following 19A. The President says he cannot work with the PM. This argument isnt valid in the Constitution because the President and Parliament are direct appointments of the people. One person appointed directly by the people of the country cannot say he is unable to work with another elected in the same manner. They must cooperate and consolidate the Constitution rather than breaking it. If the President says he cannot work with X, Y or Z, it then means he is not willing to respect the Constitution. Therefore, hes creating an undemocratic precedence. The general public shouldnt be a casualty of personal problems between the President and the PM, if any. But now look at the socio-economic cost and international pressure. There is an unprecedented brain drain situation. They must keep their egos aside and work together.
QBut he prorogued Parliament immediately after the new PM was appointed.
Prorogation is traditionally with the Queen. Nobody has interpreted it except in Parliamentary traditions. Even in England, prorogation comes with the Speaker requesting the executive to do so. This is because theres a separation of powers. The Parliament has its powers and the President cannot ask them not to work. Traditionally, in other prorogations, they inform the Speaker and in this instance the budget was supposed to commence and now coming to think of it the national budget has become less important today. According to traditions, it says that the Speaker can reconvene the majority of Parliament. During CBKs regime, she gave a lengthy order to prorogue Parliament, but the then Speaker Joseph Michael Perera said he would continue proceedings as the order was an abuse of power.
QCrossovers for staggering inducements have become a commonplace once again. This also raises a question about transparency. Why do they impose a black patch on the entire political culture
Article 99 (13) has been over-interpreted by the Supreme Court in many rulings. I cannot say if it is right or wrong, but we ended up in a situation where MPs can crossover to any side. If you want to jump into a party that is in power, you can strengthen their hands. Its the partys decision that is challenged. Parties strike deals so that decisions will not be successful. Evidence of bribing and handing over ministerial portfolios is surfacing one by one. It is in question whether an outside source is funding such interests or if it is own money that keeps falling into the wrong hands. However, there seems to be an illicit financial flow from corrupt elements. These actions need to be investigated. All MPs concerned are virtually selling our right to franchise. This debate was tabled with 19A and there was a debate to drop crossovers -- we wanted to have one provision where if you crossover you cease to be an MP. But several SLFP MPs opposed to it during the 100-day programme and eventually blocked it.

The power vested with the President to dissolve Parliament should be incorporated in the Constitution. One reason why 19A was brought in was to limit presidential powers. Earlier, the President had the authority to dissolve Parliament of his own accord after one year. This was changed in Article 70

QPeople are taking to the street to protect their democratic rights. Where do we, the general public, stand in this dilemma
People are victims of this vicious cycle. Unfortunately, they are taking party lines. Theres another group of people that find it difficult to survive without ministerial portfolios. Several others are ready to abuse power. The problem is actually with the people. If this continues, dont be surprised if people claim to not have a future in this country. We wanted to establish the rule of law. We saw how Shirani Bandaranayake was impeached and we have seen how constitutional processes were abused. They will take a little time to consolidate and will start from where they stopped.

Achilles Heel of Pakistan
	

If there is a threat to Pakistans stability and progress or even to its very existence, it is not from India, its archrival since 1947. New Delhi is yet to find a deterrent to the devastating terror strikes by Pakistan-based outfits.
The threat is not from the financial crisis that the country is facing because it can recover from it with the help from time-tested friends like Saudi Arabia and China, and grudging assistance from the IMF.
The threat is clearly from the growing power of extremist Islamic groups, which, ironically, have been fostered by the States long-standing policy of appeasement aimed at gaining peace in the short run, and political legitimacy in the long run in an avowedly Islamic Pakistan.
Basically, the trouble lies not in the power of the Islamic extremists but in the weakness of Governments.
History shows that strong Pakistani Governments have been able to rein in such groups, and weak Governments have given in to them and encouraged them in the process.
It is now accepted by all Pakistani political parties that appeasing Islamic militants would ensure political survival, even if the Government had to subject itself to the humiliation of taking dictation from them.
In a sense, this approach makes political sense. According to a 2011 Pew Poll on religion in Pakistan,75% of Pakistanis believe that blasphemy laws are necessary to protect Islam. 75% believe that apostasy deserves death. And these figures are valid across educational levels.
Therefore, it is really hard for any Government to take on the extremists, at least on this issue.
But, as stated earlier, strong, self-assured Pakistani Governments have quelled Islamic extremists successfully.
In 1953, Governor General Ghulam Muhammed imposed martial law to quell anti-Ahmadiyya riots in Lahore. Ahmadiyyas are a sect considered heretical by orthodox Muslims.
When Gen. Ayub Khan was in power (1958-69), no leniency was shown to Islamic zealots, who opposed his modern family laws and the takeover of mosques, shrines and Islamic seminaries. But things began to change after Pakistan was defeated in the war against India in 1971 and East Pakistan broke away to become Bangladesh.
In 1974, a weak Prime Minister Z.A. Bhutto felt that he had no option but to give in to Islamic agitators. But this bought him peace only for three years. In 1977 Islamists rose against him again, and he gave into them this time too.
Bhutto had played into the hands of the Islamists to such an extent that an arch Islamist army General, Zia-ul-Haq, took over with no difficulty as he had the ideological backing of the population.
Between 1977 and 1988, Gen. Zia thoroughly Islamized the country. Islamic radicalism became a basic ingredient in Pakistans political culture, the impact of which is felt to date.
In 2009, the Swat Valley became a focal point of Pakistans war against militancy and terrorism. The Government signed a peace agreement effectively ceding control of the district to the local Taliban faction, Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) allowing it to enforce its interpretation of Islamic law in Swat. But in 2014, the TTP slaughtered 140 army school students in Peshawar. TTP is banned in the UK and US.
Islamic Militant Groups
Currently, the important Islamist radical group is Tehreek-e-Labaik Pakistan (TLP), led by radical preacher Khadim Hussain Rizvi. Founded in 2015, TLP entered politics in 2017, when it blockaded Islamabad for several weeks calling for stricter enforcement of Pakistans harsh blasphemy laws. It wants an automatic death penalty for anyone deemed to have insulted Islam or Prophet Mohammad.
The TLP contested the last National Assembly elections but won no seat. However, it polled over 2.23 million votes in the National Assembly elections and more than 2.38 million at provincial elections. Allah-o-Akbar Tehreek (AAT) is headed by Hafiz Saeed, who India accuses of masterminding the 2008 Mumbai bomb attacks which killed 166 people. The UN has designated Saeed as a world terrorist with a US$10-million prize on his head.
AAT was founded after the Milli Muslim League, the political party of hard-line Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), was banned. None of AATs candidates won a seat but they got 435,000votes.
Ahle Sunnat Wal Jamaat (ASWJ) is a Sunni group which frequently spews venom against Pakistans Shia minority.
If we get power in the evening and if a single Shia is alive by the morning in Pakistan then change my name, said the leader of ASWJ, Muhammad Ahmed Ludhianvi.
ASWJ is considered to be the political face of sectarian militant group Lashkar-e-Jhangvi (LeJ), which has been behind numerous moves on Shia Muslims.
While votes for extremist parties did not translate into many seats in a first-past-the-post system, their sizeable vote banks will give them clout in an increasingly competitive political landscape, an AFP report said.
Economic Adviser
The current situation is disturbing. When newly elected Prime Minister Imran Khan appointed Dr.AtifMian, a leading Princeton economist, as one of his economic advisors, radical groups protested saying that he is an Ahmadiyya, a heretical sect. Imran said that he was not aware that Dr Mian was an Ahmadiyya and let him resign.
When the TLP protested violently for three days all over Pakistan over the Supreme Court verdict exonerating Christian woman Asia Bibi of the charge of blasphemy, the Government entered into an agreement with the outfit to buy peace. It agreed not to oppose a review petition that had been filed; to put Bibi on the Exit Control List, and to release all arrested agitators.
This, despite the fact that the TLP had called for an army mutiny and had threatened to kill the concerned Supreme Court Judges. The judges did not consider such remarks contempt of court.
The army ignored the call for mutiny and politely asked the TLP to go to court with a review petition.
The army is apparently worried about a repeat of the bloodshed following the military raid on the Red Mosque in Islamabad in July 2007 in which 50 madrassa students were killed.
It triggered the Third Waziristan War which resulted in 3,000 casualties.
It is not clear as to what the Supreme Court judges will do with the TLP targeting them. A former Governor of Punjab and a Minority Affairs Minister were killed for seeking a modification of the blasphemy law.
Instead of confronting the extremists head-on, the Imran Khan Government is trying to educate Pakistanis about real Islam, which is moderate, peaceful and tolerant.
A national level Rehmatul-il-Alameen Conference is to be held on November 20, inaugurated by the Prime Minister. Rehmatul-il-Alameen Conferences which will be held across Pakistan.
A two-day Khatm-i-Nabuwwat International Conference will be held in Islamabad to shed light on the life and philosophy of Prophet Mohammed. Among the participants will be the Imam-i-Kaaba, Vice Chancellor of Egypts Al-Azhar University, the Mufti of Syria, and religious scholars from Iraq and Tunisia. While these measures will be useful in spreading a moderate version of Islam, extremists are unlikely to be won over as they have a vested interest in keeping up militancy.
Militancy gives them power without responsibility. They cannot get votes, but have power over Governments.
Appeasing such forces does not help the rulers or the country but only fosters extremism and a culture of impunity as Minister of Human Rights Shireen Mazari said, recalling Britains appeasement of Hitler at Munich before World War II.
The Munich Deal was meant to buy peace for a while, but it only increased Hitlers appetite for dominance through aggression.


The trouble lies not in the power of the Islamic extremists but in the weakness of Governments

Afghan Taliban attacks intensify as US peace envoy returns
	

GHAZNI AFP Nov11, 2018 
The Taliban intensified attacks in a district heavily populated by minority Hazaras Sunday, as US envoy Zalmay Khalilzad returned to the region as part of efforts to convince the group to end the 17-year war. 
In pre-dawn fighting in Jaghori district in the southeastern province of Ghazni, militants killed 15 civilians and 10 members of Afghanistans elite special forces, provincial police spokesman Ahmad Khan Sirattold AFP. 
Another six special forces and eight civilians were wounded,Sirat added. 
The information could not be immediately verified by another source in the province where telecommunications are poor. A spokesman for the Afghan defence ministry in Kabul would not answer his phone. 
Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid said in a WhatsApp message that 22 Afghan commandos had been killed and a large number wounded. 
Fighting in the district has been ongoing since Wednesday, fanning fears that the violence could be rooted in ethnic or sectarian differences.

All eyes on SC
	

President Maithripala Sirisena has dug himself into a hole. Each desperate move he made to pull himself up, has further entrapped him, and dragged the country into the worst- ever political crisis in recent times. His last exploit was the capricious dissolution of Parliament, of which constitutionality was challenged in the Court by 12 Fundamental Rights petitions yesterday.The Supreme Court began hearing yesterday afternoon, despite objections by the government parties that they had not been served notice. The President did not seek the opinion of the Supreme Court when he arbitrarily dissolved Parliament in his second Friday night shocker within a fortnight- first being the sacking of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. Now the courts that he overlooked have to clear up this mess. 
President Sirisenas is an extreme case of naivety. Not every politician is an authority on the Constitution. But, many do know instinctively as to how to avoid being duped and taken for a ride by quacks. That is just commonsense. Whereas the President is said to be relying on the services of Sarath N. Silva, one-time Chief Justice, whose appointment to the pinnacle of judiciary preceded an alleged politicization of courts. Mr. Silva has argued that the President had been vested with powers to dissolve Parliament under 33 (2) C of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, which states , In addition to the powers, duties and functions expressly conferred or imposed on,or assigned to the President by the Constitution or other written law, the President shall have the power (c) to summon, prorogue and dissolve Parliament. The proclamation on the controversial dissolution of Parliament on Friday cited, that it was being carried out with powers vested in the President by paragraph (5) of Article 70 of the Constitution to be read with paragraph (2) ( c ) of Article 33 and paragraph (2) of Article 62 and in pursuance of the provisions of Section 10 of the Parliamentary Elections Act No 1 of 1981.
However, in doing so, the President overlooked a Constitutional provision incorporated under the 19A to rein in him from arbitrarily exercising such power vested in his office. It effectively deterred the President from dissolving parliament before it completes four and-a-half years into its term.
Under the 19A, Article 70 of the Constitution was amended by the repeal of paragraph (1) of that Article, and the substitution therefore of the following paragraph:- (1) The President may by Proclamation,summon, prorogue and dissolve Parliament:
Provided that the President shall not dissolve Parliament until the expiration of a period of not less than four years and six months from the date appointed for its first meeting, unless Parliament requests the President to do so by a resolution passed by not less than two-thirds of the whole number of Members (including those not present),voting in its favour . The President and his stooges, allegedly told by Sarath N. Silva have argued the Article 70 of Constitution was smuggled in after the 19A passed the judicial review. That could have been clarified had he sought the Supreme Court opinion. Instead, he clandestinely issued the proclamation on the dissolution of Parliament in the dead of Friday night. The Supreme Court verdict would resolve the constitutional basis of thePresidents decision. 
Yet the looming danger is that given the manifest tendency as witnessed during the past two weeks of the President to dig deeper in the hole he put himself in, he could spring up another surprise should the Court decide the dissolution of Parliament as unconstitutional. Another prospect is that the government would attempt to mobilize the Attorney General department to procrastinate the Supreme court deliberations, and make time to capture institutions and to intimidate political opposition and probably of the Judges themselves. 
The 19A which empowered the Constitutional Council and Independent commissions of Public service, Police, Judiciary and Human Rights helped enhance the independence of Sri Lankas independent institutions. However,gauging the actual impact of the measures introduced by the 19A on the integrity of these institutions had been elusive. While the appointments to these institutions were streamlined and depoliticized, given the rot in Sri Lankas political and institutional crisis it does not come as a shock that those who were duly appointed to high positions had lost no time to wag the tail to their political masters. IGP Pujitha Jayasundara, who was defended by the UNP when he was facing the wrath of the President has since then switched side and is seen accompanying MR.
The current political crisis presents an acid test to two independent institutions: Judiciary and Commissioner of Elections. Their behaviour would set a precedent in redefining the role of independent institutions in a country that is exceedingly politicized - Or they would prove themselves as part of the same rot. Effectively this one is the real test ofthe 19A .
President Sirisenas justification on the dissolution of Parliament, as he rationalized in an address to the nation is no less lame than his previous effort to justify the arbitrary sacking of Ranil and subsequent prorogation of Parliament. On Sunday, he claimed he decided to dissolve the House , after the going rate of a cross- over MP reached as high as Rs. 100 million to Rs. 150 million, and in one instance as high as Rs. 500 million, and the peculiar stance of the Speaker to announce a floor vote to gauge the strength of the new MR government. After several expensive crossovers to the Rajapaksa ranks, MR and Sirisena ran out of willing pole-vaulters. Faced with a vote in the House and imminent defeat, the President opted to dissolve Parliament. He also claims he decided to do so to avoid a bloodbath in the House and in every village and town. It was he who created conditions to this potentially violent upheaval. Violence has so far been averted not so much due to his resolve, but due to the over- cautious approach of the UNP. If President Sirisena played the same gimmick with MR, push back would have been a lot more violent.
The President is destined to lose irrespective of the outcome of the Supreme Court ruling. 40 SLFP Parliamentarians led by MR himself defected to the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP),MRs new political entity during the weekend. They ditched the SLFP, of which President Sirisena is the leader, in en masse. MR sees no more reasons to pay second fiddle to President Sirisena in their brief sojourn. If the latter prevails in his constitutional coup, it would not be long before, MR checkmates him. If the court rules the dissolution of Parliament as unconstitutional, then there is a different problem. Maithripala Sirisena may try to pull off another nasty surprise just to hang on to power. Either way, constitutional crisis he created is far from being resolved.

Bangladesh set to start repatriating Rohingya on Thursday
	

Hindustan Times, Nov 12, 2018 - The repatriation of ethnic Rohingya Muslims from Bangladesh, to which more than 700,000 fled since last year to escape deadly violence carried out by Myanmars security forces, will begin this week, top Myanmar officials said Sunday. 
Minister of Social Welfare, Relief and Resettlement Win Myat Aye announced at a news conference that Bangladesh had informed Myanmar authorities that repatriation, agreed upon in principle months ago, would begin on Thursday. A Myanmar government statement said an initial group of 2,251 would be sent back from mid-November at a rate of 150 per day. 
Noting that the actual date depended upon Bangladesh taking action, Win Myat Aye said, Whether it will happen on the day or not, we have to be ready on our side and we try our best to do that. Abul Kalam, Bangladeshs repatriation commissioner, said he was unaware that a date had been set. I have got no decision from our foreign ministry or any other higher authorities, he said. 
The Rohingya exodus began after Myanmar security forces launched a brutal crackdown following coordinated insurgent attacks in August 2017. The scale, organization and ferocity of the operation led to accusations from the international community, including the United Nations, of ethnic cleansing and genocide. Myanmars government has denied this.

The Diocese of Colombo of the Church of Ceylon today expressed its shock and great dismay over the dissolution of Parliament by the President.
It said in a statement that this arbitrary act appears to us to be a direct and blatant violation of the clear and express provisions of the Constitution, following the passage of the 19th Amendment
The actions of the dismissal of a sitting Prime Minister, the appointment of a new Prime Minister, the prorogation of Parliament by the President followed by credible accounts of inducements to MPs to crossover and the shifting stories about the premiership being offered to other members of Parliament are further compounded by this latest action of the President underscoring the fact that the newly appointed Prime Minister did not command the confidence of Parliament.

Court has no jurisdiction to hear FR petitions against dissolution: AG
	
The Attorney General today concluded his submissions saying that the court had no jurisdiction to hear and determine the Fundamental Rights petitions against the dissolution of Parliament.
He said the powers of the President were clear and unambiguous as provided for in the Constitution.
The Attorney General said that the President invoked his plenary executive power, which was not pruned by the 19th Amendment and could not be pruned without a referendum. 
No provision of the 19th Amendment was called for a referendum and pruning of Presidents powers must have been done via referendum. The 19th Amendment did not require a referendum because executive power was intact as it stood before the referendum. Executive powers cannot be eroded. It can be approved by people exercising the franchise.
The Article 70(1) cannot be read in isolation when all provisions of the 19th Amendment taken together did not require a referendum because it did not erode the powers of the President, he said.
He also said that although he received instructions from the President, his legal arguments in his capacity as the Attorney General were impartial at all times.
He said in the event an interim order is given, it would amount to suspending the Constitution and the sovereignty of the people.

One of the fires victims was an ailing woman whose body was found in bed in a burned-out house in Concow, near Paradise. Ellen Walker, who was in her early 70s, was home alone when the fire struck on Thursday, according to Nancy Breeding, a family friend 

Authorities have reported six additional deaths in a Northern California, raising the death toll to 29 and making it the deadliest wildfire on record in California history. 
Butte County Sheriff Cory Honea said the human remains recovered on Sunday included five bodies found at homes and one in a vehicle in Paradise. 
Honea said the devastation was so complete in some neighbourhoods that its very difficult to determine whether or not there may be human remains there. In some cases, the only remains we are able to recover are bones or bone fragments, Honea said. He also announced that 228 people remain unaccounted for since the fire began Thursday and incinerated thefoothill town. 
The statewide total of deaths from wildfires reached 31. One of the fires victims was an ailing woman whose body was found in bed in a burned-out house in Concow, near Paradise. 
Ellen Walker, who was in her early 70s, was home alone when the fire struck on Thursday, according to Nancy Breeding, a family friend. The 29 deaths matched the deadliest single fire on record, a 1933 blaze in Griffith Park in Los Angeles, though a series of wildfires in Northern California wine country last fall killed 44 people and destroyed more than 5,000 homes. 
Gov Jerry Brown asked President Donald Trump to declare a major disaster to bolster the emergency response and help residents recover. 
Trump has blamed poor forest management for the fires. Brown told a press briefing that federal and state governments must do more forest management but said thats not the source of the problem.

The suspect, whom the politico had wanted released, was under an arrest warrant in connection with a series of thefts. The suspect had reportedly played a lead role in organizing a public reception for the politico soon after he was elevated to high office under the new regime, they. The politico who stormed the Police Station about 11.10 in the night on a Sunday had also threatened and abused the officers on duty in filth.

He made good on his word!
	

This politico had to face a disciplinary inquiry held by his party for teaming up with another political party about three years ago. And he had made a bold statement to the disciplinary committee that held the inquiry: You may expel me from the party now. But I am coming back to the party in another two or three years.

This politico did make good on his word when he boldly walked into a group of big names of the party that expelled him at a key official residence in the country last week. And he was given a warm welcome, they say.
Spotting a member of the disciplinary committee that expelled him, the politico approached him and asked him with a derisive smile: Remember I told you that I would be coming back A son of a former political stalwart, this politico represents an area, once part of an ancient kingdom. His father was known for tough and tumble tactics and thuggery unleashed on his opponents in his heyday.

He was taken for a ride!
	
A politico from Wayamba has become a laughing stock after falling victim to a prank played on him by a colleague of his. This had happened when the political horse-trading was gathering its momentum.

On receiving urgent summons over the phone purportedly from a mansion of a very high authority in the city, the politico rushed there at the appointed time brimming with hope.
However, to his dismay, he found the high authority had gone out and on further inquiry that no such call had originated from that place.
Realizing that someone had made a joke at his expense, the politico had returned home sadder, but wiser.
Now he has stopped answering telephone calls, they say.

Hope SLs stability will be ensured through due process: Japan
	
The Government of Japan hopes that the stability in Sri Lanka will continue to be ensured through due process in accordance with the law, Japanese Foreign Affairs Ministry said on Sunday.
In a statement, Press Secretary Takeshi Osuga said as a longtime friend of Sri Lanka, Japan is following with close attention and interest the recent developments in Sri Lanka, including the dissolution of the parliament.
President Maithripala Sirisena dismissed Prime Minister Wickremesinghe and appointed former President Mahinda Rajapaksa as Prime Minister on October 26.
In addition, President Sirisena announced on November 9 that the Parliament of Sri Lanka would be dissolved and the general election would be held on January 5 in 2019.

International Community should let us be

(Pic AFP)

I am not taking sides in this whole sorry Constitutional affair, but I feel that only Sri Lanka and Sri Lankans alone should handle it
	The Prime Minister must have his ministers on some sort of leash as far as expenditure goes

The news of the dissolution of Parliament is bound to bring a tremendous outpouring of views from the International Community to say nothing of what the local population has to say.
But it has always intrigued me (usually irritated me) when this phrase International Community is used because to start with what does this phrase exactly mean Who or what comprises the International Community (IC) and what possible interest do most countries have in little Sri Lanka
I assume we mean the UK and the USA among a few others when we blithely ring in the I.C. and their views on the politics and politicians of Sri Lanka. The UK I suppose, is interested since we are part of the Commonwealth although their views are usually unwelcome. One remembers with recurring anger British Prime Minister David Camerons uncouth behaviour towards our then PM during his visit to Sri Lanka for the Commonwealth Conference. 
The USA may have a geopolitical interest in us other than being its naturally interfering self. India and China are world powers which are close to us historically culturally and trade wise, so I suppose they have a right to comment. Of course Japan and Pakistan have their own trade and aid interests as well. 
But what does the EU care Are we to assume that countries like Spain, Portugal, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Iceland, Sweden Denmark and the like spare even a fleeting thought as to what goes on in Sri Lanka (You notice I have left out meddling Norway!)
Unless there is a vociferous immigrant population from Sri Lanka in those countries why should our political crises worry them a whit
So when the media and various politicians talk of the International Community they are referring to a mere handful of countries  which are not making helpful suggestions other than being critical of things that are not their business.
Sovereign nation
I am not taking sides in this whole sorry Constitutional affair, but I feel that only Sri Lanka and Sri Lankans alone should handle it. In any case where are the opinions of Governments much closer to home like Myanmar, Vietnam Cambodia, Afghanistan, Laos and others They have no hidden agendas in Sri Lanka and so behave with commendable restraint. A world power like Russia has been conspicuously and tactfully silent as indeed all countries should be.
We are a sovereign nation and dont need foreign opinions to justify actions we take. We have the right to make our own mistakes (and of course we make many), but so what
We will carry on regardless of what some British parliamentarian said to an almost empty British House of Parliament a few days ago. With considerable effrontery he had the nerve to say that Britain was concerned with the safety of certain politicians. As far as I know only the Presidents safety has been thus threatened  and that threat took place long before this crisis blew up.
Unfortunately we have had an extremely poorly educated group of parliamentarians in our last Government. One must hope that a new election raises the standard of candidates selected to stand for election.
In Kenya one must have a University Degree to be able to ask for election to the House. Can we not do likewise We have plenty of nice young graduates who would certainly be better able to comprehend the nuances of our Constitution and should be able to properly understand the problems of the country and the various intricacies of policies usually hidden from public view. They will react with more maturity to vexing decisions that confront us. Hopefully they would be less open to the blatant corruption that we see on all sides today. The Leaders of all parties might bear in mind that they should support a better type of candidate. We may then hope for mature politicians among the rank and file of those in the House right now.
Let us totally endorse what Minister Eran Wickremaratne said recently namely that never will we able to expect politicians to change the country. We must change ourselves first. Surely all patriotic Sri Lankans  there is quite a number of them despite they being invisible  must agree with this. The Sri Lankan psyche must undergo a vast transformation. We should stop being a nation of sycophants for one thing. Loyalty should not be mistaken for toadyism. Telling a politician the truth about himself, which may sometimes come across as being critical, should not result in disfavor of the person making it. But it does.
Those at the top often cannot bear criticism. ( Take a look at President Trump as a case in point! ) If top leaders could take adverse comments about themselves they would be far better off for doing so.
Ours seems to be a dysfunctional system with no change in sight. The game of politics has become a game for the greedy. According to the yellow pages one politicos wife berated her husband for not taking the bribe that was offered for a cross-over. It was the chance of a lifetime to make such big money in her opinion. Ethics is not something with which she has even a nodding acquaintance. Bribes, commissions, cut-backs, money laundering is the order of the day. Spending Government money with no thought of the taxpayer has been common to all regimes.
According to a recent item in the daily papers, one minister spent Rs.10 million to have his picture printed on vouchers which were issued by his office. The sheer vanity of the whole exercise is beyond belief! In the days just after we gained Independence, impartial Civil Servants would have blocked such lunacy, but now, alas, there is apparently no authority to curtail this kind of free spending. The Prime Minister must have his ministers on some sort of leash as far as expenditure goes. Actually it would be a good idea to keep them on a permanent leash, so that we do not have the sad spectacle of each minister with a personal agenda making a fool of himself. I am reminded of Abraham Lincoln holding a cabinet Meeting. Voting took place and after he counted the votes he said Five Noes and one Aye. The Ayes have it. But then his Cabinet was not an elected one as it is in the Parliamentary system where Prime Ministers must remember they are considered first among EQUALS . The American President can override his Cabinet. Can we
Pre-dated letters of resignation
Remember when J.R. Jayawardena got a pre-dated letter of resignation from every Minister which he could use the minute one of them stepped out of line Not too democratic I suppose, but an excellent idea dont you think Recalcitrant Ministers and MPs will mind their Ps and Qs if they do not want to feel the heavy hand of a controlling authority falling heavily on their shoulders. Gossip and rumour are having a field day at this moment. To differentiate Fake News from Real News is no easy task. At a recent Ladies lunch we were greeted by the hostess with, Please do not talk politics this afternoon. Everyone had a perfectly boring time discussing the servant problem, the latest romantic goings on, fashions, children et al, but one and all were dying to get to the forbidden subject of politics. Surreptitiously we did so.
Politics is part of the fabric of Colombo life. We are a small island and all of us have some connection with politicians and Parliament. What happens in the House touches citizens of big cities in the island closely. Not so in countries with large populations where politicians are more distanced from people and the seat of power is a far away entity from the average voter.

Politics is part of the fabric of Colombo life. We are a small island and all of us have some connection with politicians and Parliament. What happens in the House touches citizens of big cities in the island closely
This can be an advantage or not. Personally I enjoy political a chit chat so long as no one gets offended in the process of discussion. At this time can we be blamed for letting the current state of governmental affairs take precedence in all conversations Of course we listen to the words of experts like Savitri Gonesekera and Radhika Coomaraswamy without question. Not that they are particularly comforting at the moment but we heed them.
All that most of us want is a comfortably stable Government with a predictable agenda and an incorruptible (and educated) set of ministers. Of course are we hoping for Utopia

13 Lankans fled for Israel following October revolution detained
	
Thirteen Sri Lankans who had fled to Israel after reportedly having received death threats following the October revolution have been imprisoned for two weeks and deprived of rights, the Jerusalem Post reported on Sunday.
Quoting a report by the KAN Bet News, the Jerusalem Post said the 13 fled to Israel on tourist visas and planned to apply for asylum in Israel.
Following questioning at Ben-Gurion Airport, in the absence of a translator and with one member of the group speaking on behalf of them all, the 11 men and two women had been taken to the Yahalom detention facility.
KAN Bet reported that they were denied access to the outside world, forbidden to make phone calls, denied access to their own belongings and could not change clothes for a week.
One of the group members, who suffers from kidney disease and diabetes, wound up hospitalized at Kaplan Medical Center in Rehovot. Later, the group was transferred to the Givon Prison.
Before they had been taken to Yahalom, one of the group members managed to send a message from his cell phone to the Sri Lankan community in Israel. The community turned to the Hotline for Refugees and Migrants, who then sent lawyers to meet with them.
Following negotiations, they were allowed to briefly enter the Yahalom facility to hear their story and receive a power of attorney to represent the group.
From there, said Hotline for Refugees and Migrants attorney Tal Steiner, the lawyers raced to court because the state was threatening to deport them immediately.
The state, Steiner said, claimed that Yahalom is extraterritorial territory, and the laws of the state do not apply there, therefore, the state has the authority to hold them there in custody indefinitely and without judicial review.
The Immigration Detention Review Tribunal in Givon ruled that the detention was illegal and that the group members should have been released immediately, but the state appealed the decision to the District Court. The hearing was set to be held on Monday.
The Immigration Ministrys Population and Immigration Authority said in response that the Immigration Detention Review Tribunal does not have the authority to hear cases of those whose entry into Israel was denied, and for this reason an appeal was filed with the District Court.
Thirteen passengers arrived at the border crossing at Ben-Gurion Airport, and when they were questioned, they explicitly admitted that they had arrived for work in Israel, the authority said.
The subject of asylum was not raised at any point, not even when they were denied entry, but only after they received a representative [lawyer] was the subject raised for the first time  which of course raises questions,

Life pinches them like new shoes !
	
Cobbler family beneath banyan tree forced into separation by poverty
Having persisted working as a street-based cobbler for seven years, their familys survival hangs by a thread. You may chance to spot the shoemaking couple by the Lipton Circus; seated by the side of the road on their rugged mat, their plastic bagged belongings beside them, eagerly waiting for someone to stop by in need of their services. 
Anusha, a mother of four, claims that on a good day they may earn a gratifying thousand rupees the most, adding that on most days they have to deal with a penniless reality. 
They werent always vagrant and destitute she says. Anusha recalls a time her family was able to afford the rent and live under the same roof owing to a steady income from their mango business. Following its failure, the children; two teenagers and the others aged seven and nine, now reside with an aunt in Thotalanga (Colombo 14) and are visited by their parents only once every few weeks. This arrangement was made with their childrens best interests at heart. The pair was adamant that financial disability should not obstruct their education and wellbeing. The oldest will in fact be sitting for (his) the Ordinary Level Examinations this year. 
The struggling parents face countless endeavours on a daily basis; their biggest challenge these days being the rain. The downpour not only ascertains a lack of clients, but also leaves them unsheltered, drenched and starved. 
Health issues 
Anusha recalls being chased away by security officials as she brought to light a game of constant running, hiding and returning to their impermanent settlement underneath the Banyan tree. 
In addition to these challenges, they also battle health related problems like diabetes which inadvertently develop new expenses. 
Having witnessed her nimble fingers expertly take on various tasks of repairing, it was remarkable to hear that this craft was one theyd picked up by watching others at work. It was one they had to learn out of sheer desperation, but due to an obvious lack of business, a rise in the cost of living and a difficulty to restock needles, wax and other essentials, it is one they are struggling to continue with. While Anusha tends to their meagre mending work, her husband wanders the streets in search of odd jobs which fetches a few extra rupees. 
Although their dwellings, their garments and their lifestyles are evidently worn out and insipid, the adversaries named poverty and hardship find their resolve and faith to be invincible. The duo, who claim to be church-goers, have even assembled a humble altar of religious pictures on their worn out coir mat- a symbol of colourful hope amidst a dreary reality. 
If their sympathetic tale, their admirable parental sacrifices and their unwavering faith arent enough conviction of their deserving condition, their one request will ensure it. When asked what they require most urgently, Anusha assured us that while hunger and thirst were bearable burdens, separation from their children was not. It is therefore a house that they desire the most, to reunite their family and to escape homelessness. 
Philanthropists are urged to aid them by any means to meet their genuine request. They may be contacted on 0753234404 or found at their usual spot near the United Motors showroom nestled under the shade of the Banyan tree.

Namal Kumara decides to contest election from SLPP
	
Anti-Corruption Force Operations Director Namal Kumara today said that he would contest at the upcoming Parliamentary Election as the Sri Lanka Podu Jana Peramuna (SLPP) ticket.
Speaking to the Daily Mirror he said people had requested to contest for the election for the betterment of the country.
I have revealed many secrets and confidential recording to protect the President and the country. By revealing those things I did not expect anything. I risked my life for the country to protect the President, he said.
I asked from which party should I contest, and they said it was better to contest through the SLPP. I did not select, he said.
I dont have money to spend on campaign. According to Sri Lankan culture to contest an election, the candidate should have money to spend. I can do media campaigns and do poster campaigns. I dont have anything to hide in my life.
I expect to meet Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa to discuss how to contest at the election.
I do not hope to come to Parliament as a National List MP. I want to come to Parliament from the peoples votes.
And I do not want to stay as a lifetime Minister in Parliament. If I were elected, I would only stay only for four years. With the work, Im doing in Parliament and to the people, they will decide my future, he said. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)

Nidahase Piya  or why history is a mystery
	

Pauline Kael once complained that what was so uninteresting about David Leans films was that they were in such goddamn good taste. Suneth Malinga Lokuhewas Nidahase Piya, in that sense, has taste, goddamn good or otherwise. In the end thats the only real thing it can claim for itself.
Everythings so clearly planned and choreographed: the period pieces and costumes are authentic; the dates of various events are made obvious (too obvious) for us; and when these dont seem to suffice, the scriptwriter (Nishantha Weerasinghe) gives us one self-righteous one-liner after another. (A sample: The air we breathe exudes the freedom you won for us!). But all this is a facade.
I knew what I was in for, and what lay beneath that facade, when, in the opening sequence at Galle Face beach, Richard Aluwihare (Douglas Ranasinghe) and G. G. Ponnambalam (Milinda Perera) incessantly praised the hero as the man who brought freedom to the country. The praises kept on coming and going like a ball at a tennis match, so much so that I begin to wonder whether the hero of the story had been conceived by the scriptwriter solely to attract praise from his co-stars. Hes more saintly than Gandhi, and less misunderstood. At one point, I couldnt help but think that the crew had the cake with him and ate it too: hes so perfect, his intentions so clear, his purpose so messianic. He cannot fail. He does not.
This comes out even in the opening credits: the music (by Samantha Perera) exudes a patriotic streak, until bang!  after the directors name is listed, the title of the film comes onscreen like its the opening to a superhero flick. I almost heard the director whisper to us there, Its not the nations Father, stupid, its Superman!
Part of the reason why Nidahase Piya staggers like a ship rigged with so many holes that wants to make it to the next port even though its sinking is the ambivalent nature of its protagonist. Nationalists, even hardcore Sinhala Buddhists, idealise Senanayake for having salvaged their heritage through Gal Oya scheme and the Senanayake Samudraya. In this revisionist version of history, the members of the Ceylon National Congress, of which Senanayake was a leading light, regained the centuries we lost to the British. By carving a moderate political settlement, so the narrative goes, the Congress embraced a pluralist society, which freed them from the sectarian pressures that rocked the Indian independence movement, culminating with the establishment of the United National Party in 1946. Given that most if not all of the heavyweights behind the film (Wijeyadasa Rajapaksha was one of the producers, and I saw Mangala Samaraweeras name in the credits) are card carrying members of the UNP, it comes to no surprise that the UNP and the Congress are valorised as shining lights that rescued Sri Lanka from the fate that befell its neighbour.
But thats the revisionist view. The historical reality, as always, is different.
riots
The film itself tells us what that reality is by what it omits. One does not have to read Kumari Jayawardanas meticulously researched essays and books to understand that behind the Temperance movement, the Buddhist revival of the 20th century, and the drive towards constitutional reforms was an almost never-ending clash between an old order and a new order of legislators who didnt have much that distinguished them from each other (as Professor Jayawardana puts it, it was a fight between the old Mudliyars and the new Misters).
It wasnt the shining lights of the Congress who called for complete independence, though the movie tells us otherwise; it was Philip Gunawardena, who did so 14 years before Senanayake resigned from the Congress because he disagreed with its revised aim of full freedom. I dont need to mention here that the film makes no reference whatsoever to the Left movement. When it does come close to the campaigns of that movement (as with Mooloyo estate strikes), the director hurries along (because, after all, the strikes were organised by the samasamajists, and not the Congress, though we see Senanayakes troupe meet Andrew Caldecott).

Audiences will come from Nidahase Piya with the most wrong ideas about the kind of people these heroes were: the biggest failing in Lokuhewas film, bigger than the historical realities it omits
Then there are the 1915 riots. To its credit, the movie makes one fact clear: the belief nurtured by the Temperance movement that the British were instigating a riot between Sinhalese and Muslims at the behest of Indian Moors. (I wonder whether the director inserted this to justify Senanayakes later act of disenfranchising the Indian estate Tamils. Which, if true, begs the question: is it adequate as a palliative for guilt)
But then theres the execution of Henry Pedris. In his depiction, the director presents the man as a hard-as-nails, tough-as-stone anti-imperialist, going as far as to stage an encounter atop a bridge between Pedris (on horseback) and an English couple. Laying aside the god-awful tripe that passed for dialogue there (I found myself rooting for Pedris, not because of my patriotism, but because of the acting of the couple), this version of what happened fails to account for one point: that he was a scapegoat and that he did not side with the Sinhalese (against the Muslims). In fact, so successful and efficient was he at disbanding the rioters (Sinhalese Buddhists) that he stoked jealousy among the more established elite. This, and not his nationalist streak, was what led the British to press false charges on him.
Nidahase Piya hence does a good job of concealing the rifts between two different sections of a landed, conservative, compradore elite. And yet, thats not what repels me; after all, even David Lean and Robert Bolt took liberties with history.
suitable for children
But despite his romanticised depiction of history, Lean was able to make his films convincing in some strange, fascinating way. What most people dont get about them is that its not just the set pieces or the cinematography or the costumes that make them so evocative. Images and visuals count, but if theres nothing for them to stand on, they end up standing apart from the rest of the film, when then meanders along until we lose the thread and wonder what the heck it is that were watching.
We know, for instance, that even though thats not how the Russian revolution played out (Doctor Zhivago), or how the Irish rebelled against the British after the Easter Rising (Ryans Daughter), there was a semblance of reality captured within a mass of artifice. This is exactly whats missing in our biopics, especially those that try to imitate the craftsmanship of Lean, and thats what missing in Nidahase Piya. Theres another problem.
People may fault me for ignoring the fact that the actors who played Moses and Spartacus and Commodus and all those Romans and Greeks and Asians were miles away from the milieus they were supposed to represent; that they whitewashed or, if I am to recast a local term, toiyya-fied, these characters. I am willing to meet that accusation when I claim that I see the opposite problem in Nidahase Piya.
I am not an English speaking snob by any stretch of the imagination, but when so many mistakes of diction are made, at odds with the milieu the characters come from, I wonder where the money those big shots put into the production went to. I read somewhere (I think in Mawbima) that the director resisted an offer by a powerful individual who insisted on having his son cast as Senanayake. Laudable, certainly, which is why I believe that had he been more circumspect, without giving into the urge to have a star studded cast, the performances would been more convincing.
As they stand, right now, they are not. (To give just one example, G. R. Pereras interpretation of Don Spater Senanayake comes off as incongruous on so many levels; he transforms the patriarch from the ruthless capitalist of the Bothale walawwa that history remembers him as to a well meaning but irate village headman.) Audiences will come from Nidahase Piya with the most wrong ideas about the kind of people these heroes were: the biggest failing in Lokuhewas film, bigger than the historical realities it omits. And whats worse is that it has been explicitly marketed as suitable for children. Talk about mis-educating the youth!
Curiously enough, the only part of the film that really appealed to me neednt have been there: the sequence where the young Senanayake tells a lie about his class rank to his parents. It was fictionalised, hardly, if at all, essential to the story. And yet, its the only part which stood out for me. Why Because, for a moment at least (because of its humour, perhaps), it transcended its blatant a-historicism and embraced that sense of conviction which the cinema, as Lokuhewa should know, is so capable of conjuring. It was the only spark that kept the film alive, not because the rest of the film was glossed over, but because it was original.
Nidahase Piya, in short then, was unoriginal. Worse, it was uninspired.

Onela ordered to submit details of GTL to CID
	
Colombo Chief Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne yesterday ordered MP Ravi Karunanayakes daughter, Onela Karunanayake to submit details of the director board of Global Transport Logistics (GTL) to the Criminal Investigations Department (CID).
It was earlier reported that the GTL is a company which MP Ravi Karunanayakes wife and daughter were directors.
When the case was taken up in Courts, the Magistrate ordered the CID to record a statement from Mr. Karunanayakes daughter yesterday or some other day.
The Colombo Chief Magistrate last Friday ordered Onela Karunanayake to appear in Courts on Monday (12) considering a motion filed by the CID.
During the proceedings, Senior State Counsel Lakmini Grihagama supporting the motion filed by the CID said Onela Karunanayake was asked to report to the CID to record her statement in connection with the investigations into the bond scam.
President's Counsel Shavendra Fernando appearing with Sajeewa Jayawardena for the two lawyers who had accompanied Ms Onela said she had gone to the CID on October 29 on a request by the CID to make the statement. But without recording her statement the CID had asked her to come on another day.
She had reported to the CID on November 5 with attorneys Aravinda Gamage and Amila Pieris.
The counsel said a person introducing himself as the receptionist had asked for the names of the two attorneys and refused to allow them to accompany Ms. Karunanayake. Thereafter, Ms Onela after spending some time at the CID premises had returned home. (Yoshitha Perera)

"President Can't Act like Alice in Wonderland"- Counsel tell SC
	
Challenging all arguments in favour of the dissolution of Parliament, the Supreme Court (SC) yesterday heard ten petitions arguing that President Maithripala Sirisena must abide by the Constitution when exercising Executive powers, and could not act like Alice in Wonderland.
Ten petitioners yesterday informed court that the President's powers to dissolve parliament under Article 33 (2) (c) of the constitution was not an unfettered power, and was restricted by Article 70 (1). All counsel maintained that Article 33 was an empowering provision, which was subject to procedure. They argued that 33 (A) was clear on the President's accountability to parliament, adding that therefore the dissolving of parliament was 'ab initio void', or "invalid from the outset", and was both illegal and unconstitutional.
Explaining what was termed as the "absurdity of the argument" that Article 33 (2) (c ) can stand alone, M.A Sumanthiran PC provided the example. If the power to summon, prorogue or dissolve parliament under 33 (2) (c) was to stand alone, that means the President can prorogue parliament indefinitely. Can he do that No he cannot because his powers to prorogue are confined by Article 70 (3), he said.
The Counsel said the President had cited Article 70 (5) to dissolve parliament, when such powers are in fact derived from Article 70 (1). The only provision under which the President can dissolve parliament is found in Article 70 (1). There is no other provision in the Constitution that provides for dissolution by proclamation. He has no mandate to dissolve parliament before four-and-a-half years or without a two-thirds majority, Hejaaz Hizbullah, Counsel for Commissioner of Elections' Prof. Ratnajeevan Hoole told court. Mr. Hoole is one of the three members of the Elections' Commission, and he called the President's actions "illegal and unconstitutional, first as a respondent and then as a petitioner.
Commencing submissions last afternoon, K. Kanag-Isvaran PC appearing for Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan with M.A Sumanthiran PC and Niran Anketell, explained the nature of the constitution after the 19th Amendment. Article 62 (2) which states that every Parliament shall continue for five years, and the expiry of the said five years shall operate as a dissolution, is the norm, not the exception. The exception is provided for in 70 (1), he said. Thereafter pointing out that the proviso in Article 70 (1) was mandatory, he said:  I dont think I need to explain myself when the constitution clearly says shall not my Lords. It says you can't. There is no way out,.
Article 70 (1) of the Constitution reads: Provided that the President shall not dissolve Parliament until the expiration of a period of not less than four years and six months from the date appointed for its first meeting, unless Parliament requests the President to do so by a resolution passed by not less than two-thirds of the whole number of Members (including those not present), voting in its favour.
"The elephant in the room is the missing reference to Article 70 (1) in the proclamation. What it has referred to is 70 (5) which has got nothing to do with the power of dissolution by proclamation. Its that simple, Mr. Kanag-Isvaran said.
Responding to Mr. Kanag-Isvaran's submissions, Hejaaz Hizbullah cited the dicta in the case of Karunathilake v Dayananda Dissanayake justifying his client's stance that the President's actions were illegal and unconstitutional, and therefore must be heard.
My client can't act with a clear conscience when the very basis of the constitution has been violated by the actions of the President. In fact Your Lordship's Court has held that the Elections' Commissioner must not do so, he said, before going on to read passages of the judgement of the case.
Earlier when the Fundamental Rights application filed by R.Sambanthan was taken up at 12.20 Deputy Solicitor General Sanjay Rajarathnam informed court that the Attorney General had not been served with notices and said he was yet to receive instructions from the Elections Commission who were cited as Respondents.
The Petitioners informed court that their Petitions were filed at 8.30 AM last morning. The fact that the Petitions were filed in the morning and made its way to the Court house in the afternoon was not lost by many, who usually have to wait weeks before a Fundamental Rights petition is listed for hearing.
However, Chief Justice Nalin Perera informed the Mr. Rajarathnam to obtain instructions and be present at 2. PM after which court was adjourned. Thereafter, a team led by the Attorney General Jayantha Jayasuriya PC himself together with Solicitor General Dappula De Livera, Nerin Pulle DSG PC,Indika Demuni De Silva DSG PC Dr. Avanthi Perera SSC and C walked into court a few minutes before 2 PM.
As soon as court resumed Mr. Jayasuriya PC informed the three judge bench, headed by Chief Justice Nalin Perera and Justice Prasanna Jayawardena and Priyantha Jayawardena, the scheduled bench for today in court room 502 that they had to move for time to obtain instructions. The Attorney General said that he was made a party in terms of Article 35 the Constitution which provides for the AG to be made a party  of anything done or omitted to be done by the President, in his official capacity
However, the Bench informed the Attorney General that they were inclined to hear the Petitioners following which the Attorney General was permitted to make submissions today. Several Counsel including those representing Prof. G. L Peiris, and Channa Jayasumana, both staunch supporters of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa sought to intervene. The court informed them to follow the procedure in order to intervene. They are scheduled to make submissions today having filed intervening papers.
Throughout the submissions made thereafter, including that of Thilak Marapana PC representing the UNP, Counsel maintained that the President had no power to dissolve parliament without following the procedure laid down in the constitution.
 We ask for an interim order against the proclamation. Your Lordships would want to know what flows from it and what flows from it is that the status quo ante (the way things were before) remains. If they want they can go to parliament and resolve to dissolve parliament. But nothing can flow from illegality. The proclamation is illegal and nothing can flow from it Counsel said.
Geoffrey Alagrathnam PC, representing Mano Ganesan quoting from Lord Atkin in the case of Liveridge v Anderson a landmark case in Britain regarding the separation of powers where Lord Atkin Quoted a dialogue between Humpty Dumpty and Alice, said the President cannot be allowed to pick and chose which parts of the Constitution to follow and which to negate.
Harnessing the point further, Hejaaz Hizbullah, representing Rathnajeewan Hoole as Petitioner said if 33 (2) (c ) was to be considered a stand alone provision, that would in effect mean the President having the power to dissolve or prorogue parliament even when an impeachment motion has been submitted to the speaker.
Suren Fernando representing the All Ceylon Muslim Congress went further to highlight the absurdity of this construction. This was a mala-fide move for a collateral purpose".
Jayampathy Wickremarathne PC who made submissions quoting widely from the leading text on the interpretation of statutes  Bindrar on Interpretation said that there was no mode in which the actions of the President could be legitimized.
Presidents Counsel Ikram Mohomed representing the Muslim Congress also made submissions in support of the arguments put forward by the Counsel. There is no way this can be cured except by Your Lordships Court. And that is by holding that this move is illegal and unconstitutional he said.
Counsel J.C. Weliamuna represented the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna, whilst Viran Corea represented the Centre for Policy Alternatives and Thishya Weragoda civil society activists. All Counsel sided with the submissions of the other.
Having heard submissions till 5 PM the court adjourned. The Attorney General made an application for the hearings to be taken up on Wednesday which was denied. The hearing will commence at 10 AM today in Court 502. (Hafeel Farisz)

## Title: Regaining Ayodhya: For Hindus or Buddhists 
## Section: Opinion

Regaining Ayodhya: For Hindus or Buddhists 
	

On November 6, the BJP-run Uttar Pradesh State Government renamed the district of Faizabad as Ayodhya. With 85% of the district population being Hindusthe populist move by Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath was seen as a strategy to retain the Hindu vote against four-time Chief Minister Mayawati and a rejuvenated Congress at next years Lok Sabha polls. 
In the heart of the district sits Ayodhya, which is the epicentre of a long standing dispute between the Hindus and Muslims of India. Believed to be the birth place of Lord Ram by the Hindus it saw growing tensions between the two communities ever since the 16th century Mogul Emperor Babur put up a mosque in the place believed to be the birth site of Ram.
The massive mosque, known as Babri Masjid, was demolished in 1992 by Hindu nationalist groups led by the BJP, RSS and Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP). It was said that the mosque was built by destroying a Hindu temple. Today, Chief Minister Adityanath vows to build a temple for Ram in the site soon. 
The renaming Faizabad as Ayodhya, however, is not welcomed by all Hindus. Theres a section that believes that it was totally unnecessary and politically motivated. On the other hand, the Muslims in Uttar Pradesh feel marginalized ever since Adityanath took office owing to the slew of strong pro-Hindu, populist moves he has made since last years election. 
Meanwhile, the President of the National Commission for Minorities which is the national body for minorities feels building Ram Temple will settle the centuries long dispute and at least thereafter the Muslims in the country would be able live without fear. 
Hindus must be allowed to build Ram Temple so that Muslims can live peacefully, respectfully and without fear its President Hasan Rizvi told media recently. However, building the Hindu Temple is not going to be as easy as everyone thinks. 
The archaeological Survey excavations carried out in the disputed site in the 2000-2003 period following court orders in view of the dispute, have not found single evidence of an ancient Hindu temple there. Instead, mass evidence was found pointing to the existence of a Buddhist centre with ruins of stupas and Buddhist style pillars and structures. 
Buddhists have long been insisting that the site was a Buddhist place of worship. The city of Ayodhya, known as Saket during Buddhas time, according to literature and inscriptions, had been a major centre of Buddhism. 
Excavations carried out in the 19th century by the British historian and the founder of the Archaeological Survey of India, Sir Alexander Cunningham, too had found Buddhist artefacts and ruins in and around the place. In March this year, a petition was filed in the Supreme Court by a Buddhist insisting that authorities should go by archaeological evidence and do justice to Buddhists if ever any action was to be taken as regards the site. In July, a writ application was filed by a Buddhist petitioner claiming the Buddhist right to the site and the bench agreed to admit it. 
A few days back a BJP member of the Legislative Council Savitribai Phule too demanded that a Buddhist Statue be erected in the site as archaeological evidence proves it to be a Buddhist site. 
Meanwhile, last month the BJP-run UP government moved to rename Allahabad as Prayagraj and now wants Agra the home of Taj Mahal to be called Agarwal as the name Agra was given to it by a 16th century Moghul ruler Sultan Sikandar Lodi. Following Chief Minister Adityanaths footsteps Vijaya Rupani, the Chief Minister of PM Narendra Modis home base, Gujarat, last week announced he would rename state capital Ahmadabad as Karnavati. With 84% of its population being Hindu Ahmadabad, popularly known as the city of temples, is believed to have 568 Hindu temples in the city. 
According to opinion polls despite a few setbacks at recent polls the BJP still has a fairly good hold on the Hindus who form 80% of the countrys population much to the discomfit of the Muslims who make up 14% of the nation. However, now that the Muslim claim for Ayodhya is being weakened one wonders whether the Hindus will meet a new rival in their claim for Ayodhya with Buddhists putting forward a stronger claim.

SC order: Resounding victory for peoples franchise
	
UNP Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe today said the interim order issued by Supreme Courts suspending the dissolution of Parliament was a resounding victory for the peoples franchise.
Mr. Wickremesinghe told a media briefing last evening that the action of the Supreme Courts have shown that one cannot play around with the Constitution. This decision by the Supreme courts has shown that you cannot play around with the Constitution. It has shown that one cannot play football with the Constitution pushing it around. It has also shown that Presidents power is limited and that we must act according to the law. The action of the Supreme Courts have shown that President is not above the law., he said.
It is also a victory for decent politics, he added.
We appreciate the order given by the Supreme Court as there was lot of pressure on them. The order has made it clear that one must abide with the Constitution. We are prepared to give reasons as to why dissolution was illegal and unconstitutional when the court starts hearing on December 7, 2018, he also said. He said yesterdays victory was just one achievement and there are more to be achieved.
UNP Leader thanked the Supreme Courts, Speaker Karu Jayasuirya for maintaining the dignity and power of Parliament. He also thanked all those who got together to protect the rights of the people including the Maha Sangha, other religious leaders and political parties and individuals who got together to uphold the rights of the people.
Also Mr. Wickremesinghe claimed that Parliament will be convened today.
House will be convened today and we will show our majority. We will show that we have not lost the majority in Parliament. We will show that we are the legitimate government today, he said.
I would like to tell all government servants to follow the Constitution and would also like to tell the police that Speaker is in charge of security in the House and that they should adhere to instructions given by him.
MP Patali Champika Ranawaka said yesterday was an important day in the history of Sri Lanka. We have managed to show that Presidents power was limited. The Supreme Courts which we made independent has given a land mark order. We appeal to President not to be stubborn and get ready to accept a legitimate government, he said.
MP Sujeewa Senasinghe said the UNP MPs who held ministerial portfolios will go back to their ministries today and resume duties. We are now Ministers and we will resume duties today, he said. (Yohan Perera)

SC stays proclamation dissolving parliament
	
A three-judge bench of the Supreme Court today issued an interim order till December 7 staying the proclamation issued by President Maithripala Sirisena to dissolve parliament.
It also granted leave to proceed with the fundamental rights petitions which sought a court order nullifying the presidential proclamation dissolving parliament. The intervenient petitions were also allowed.
The petitions were fixed for argument on December 4,5 and 6.
The SC also issued an injunction barring the Elections Commission from taking any action regarding the election until December 7.
Several petitioners including UNP Chairman Kabir Hasim, UNP MP Ajith P. Perera, JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake, TNA leader R. Sampanthan and Attorney Lal Wijenayake filed FR petitions challenging the dissolution of Parliament.
Earlier Attorney General Jayantha Jayasuriya in his submissions said the President had invoked his plenary executive power, which was not pruned by the 19th Amendment and could only be pruned by a referendum.
He said the court had no jurisdiction to hear and issue a determination on the FR petitions against the dissolution of Parliament and that the powers of the President were clear and unambiguous as provided for in the Constitution.
No provision of the 19th Amendment had called for a referendum and the pruning of Presidents powers must have been done via referendum. The 19th Amendment did not require a referendum because executive power was intact as it stood before the referendum. Executive powers cannot be eroded. It can be approved by people exercising the franchise.
The Article 70(1) cannot be read in isolation when all provisions of the 19th Amendment taken together did not require a referendum because it did not erode the powers of the President, he said.
The AG also said though he received instructions from the President, his legal arguments in his capacity as the Attorney General were impartial at all times.
He said in the event an interim order was given, it would amount to suspending the Constitution and the sovereignty of the people. (S.S. Selvanayagam, Shehan Chamika Silva and Hafeel Farisz)

Senior scribe Rajalingam struggling after accident
	
Around mid-day on September 9 (2018), whilst returning from the library, cautious and lawful though he was, a motorcycle, approaching at high speed, drove straight into Rasiah Rajalingam knocking him down on the road, and gasp....all this happened on the zebra crossing at the Hendala Junction. Rajalingam, recalling the incident while talking to the Daily Mirror said that he was barely conscious minutes after being knocked down. 
With decades of invaluable service at Virakesari, M.D Gunesena, Lakehouse and Wijeya Newspapers under his belt, Rajalingam had eased into a freelance lifestyle which had been just sufficient to support his family. As both a father, husband and grandfather he was still an essential source of finance to his family, making the consequences of the accident a blow to both himself and his dependants. 
Rajalingam found the roles reversed as he sat down to recount the scarring experience with this writer. 

With decades of invaluable service at Virakesari, M.D Gunesena, Lakehouse and Wijeya Newspapers under his belt, Rajalingam had eased into a freelance lifestyle which had been just sufficient to support his family
Following the unfortunate accident, Rajalingam, now enduring restricted movement and a broken arm, finds himself at a great disadvantage. He ruefully described his complete dependency on his wife, who despite her own frailties, dedicates herself to feeding, bathing and dressing him. 
Forced into this static period of recovery, he flips through a faded scrapbook thick with nostalgia and pride. Clippings of news articles he had written over the years fills up its pages. Not only are they all diverse in their coverage, but also displays his tri-lingual contributions to the field. 
Residing in his humble abode in the inner reaches of Hunupitiya, Wattala, Rajalingam addressed the road accident as an undeserved serving of repercussions to himself and his family despite being a law abiding pedestrian. In his partially immobilised state, he finds his source of income cut off, but new expenses flooding in. Frequent trips to the hospital and the courthouse have become a weighted burden to the simple family of Rajalingam.

While he feels strongly about wrongs being righted, his immediate concerns lie in carrying his family forward. Refusing to let physical disability hold him back and responding to a passion for journalism, he is making his left arm his tool of independence.

## Title: SL where Democracy needs no Peoples Sovereignty

SL where Democracy needs no Peoples Sovereignty
	

Colombos yahapalanacivil society activists became hysterical when Parliament was dissolved by President Sirisena again on a Friday. The gazette notification was out midnight Friday November 9, 2018. I too agree, it was definitely a frustrated reaction to the combine failure of Sirisena-Rajapaksa attempts to regain a majority in parliament after removing Ranil Wickremesinghe from premiership and appointing Mahinda Rajapaksa.
Travelling to Elpitiya and back on Saturday, Colombos desperate protests against the dissolution of parliament was not there to be heard or seen among those ordinary folk in the hinterlands. MR was smiling and waving from billboards of different sizes with affectionate slogans. One said You are our Appachchi (father). Back in Colombo, it was confirmed the UNP the TNA and the JVP would seek Supreme Court rulings declaring the dissolution illegal and to have an order refraining the National Election Commission (NEC) in holding parliamentary elections on January 5, 2019. How DEMOCRATIC is this demand against the dissolution of parliament to hold elections for people to elect a government of their choice

When sovereignty remains inalienable at all times and includes powers of Govt, fundamental rights and franchise, the hurriedly adopted 19A clearly violates the sovereignty of the people
A few Colombo-based Experts on Constitutional Law with funded civil society agents argue it is illegal. They are the same Colombospeoples powergroup who campaigned against MR, with Sirisena as their Common Candidate at the January 8, 2015 presidential election and promised democracy and good governance. What those promises meant to the larger majority of the people during the past three years and ten months, and what the good governance coalition between Sirisena and Wickremesinghe as a Unity Government delivered to the people, remain as unmistakably the most miserable failure in post independent Sri Lanka. 
That being the most obvious reason for the re-emergence of MR, arguments against the dissolution of parliament and against holding parliamentary elections with him heading a caretaker government are based solely on the 19 Amendment. It is said, while the President can dissolve parliament under Article 33(2)(c), it cannot be read without Article 70 of 19A that defines powers of the parliament and its procedure. It is thus said, Article 70 very explicitly says, (1) The President may by Proclamation, summon, prorogue and dissolve Parliament: Provided that the President shall not dissolve Parliament until the expiration of a period of not less than four years and six months from the date appointed for its first meeting, unless Parliament requests the President to do so by a resolution passed by not less than two-thirds of the whole number of Members (including those not present), voting in its favour.
Yes, not only the Constitution, but most legal enactments cannot be read with their clauses extracted out, to be interpreted in isolation,when other clauses and related laws provide teeth and muscle to it. So is the 19A that is taken in isolation by these Colombo-based experts. The 19 Amendment should be read along with Article 3 of Chapter I of the Constitution.The only exception being, this Article of the Constitution can be read by itself and needs no other Article in the Constitution or any clause in any other law for its interpretation. It simply says, In the Republic of Sri Lanka, Sovereignty is in the People and is inalienable. Sovereignty includes the powers of government, fundamental rights and franchise. How would the Colombo experts read this with the 19 Amendment and its provision, Provided that the President shall not dissolve Parliament until the expiration of a period of not less than four years and six months from the date appointed for its first meeting 
When sovereignty remains inalienable at all times and includes powers of government, fundamental rights and franchise, the hurriedly adopted 19 Amendment clearly violates the sovereignty of the people. Therefore, 19A itself is unconstitutional. written into the Constitution in a mighty hurry by the yahapalana rulers who shouted down MPs when asked for their right to have Tamil translations of clauses pushed in at the last minute. Chamal Rajapaksa as Speaker then, went dumb on it and the JVP that now talks about democracy did not demand Sinhala translations either. The 19A for all those reasons too, remain unconstitutional though blindly and selfishly backed by urban civil society cheer leaders. It had no social discourse and far worse, it had no serious discussion and debate in parliament as well.
Ushering in of the Yahapalanaya ushered in a spate of defacing and distorting the will of the people by very undemocratic means using presidential powers under President Sirisena. The first was when the President appointed the Leader of the Opposition as PM with only 43 MPs to support him. The Colombo FB Activists who question the mental status of a President who believes a MP without a majority in parliament could be appointed as PM, never said a President who appoints a PM with only 43 MPs in a parliament of 225, could be loony. The President used his newly won heavy authority to completely change the peoples representation, the will of the people in parliament elected in April 2010, to provide his prime ministerial appointee with a majority. President Maithripala Sirisena became the darling of the funded Colombo Civil Society, for breaching the peoples will in parliament in their favour, calling it legal then as 19A wasnt in place. What these honourable gentlemen and ladies essentially say is, constitutional provisions can be used to undermine democracy for their own benefit.
This was replayed once again after the August 2015 parliamentary elections. The President was applauded when he played all the trumps in his hand to scuttle and derail the UPFA campaign against the UNP, led by MR. Those horribly indecent public manoeuvrings were made by Sirisena as President of the country and also as President of the SLFP. He was vilified by 4.2 million SLFP supporters who voted with MR and against the UNP. The UPFA won 95 seats as against 106 of the UNP. Again, President Sirisena defaced the parliamentary representation that was decided by the people. He moved 37 UPFA MPs into the UNP fold with ministerial portfolios. 
And now the latest effort since proroguing parliament on October 26 is also about shifting MPs to create a parliamentary representation the Sirisena-Rajapaksa duo could control. Immediately, the UNP decided on a Temple Trees Take-over defying Sirisenas decision. Over a week ago, the prorogued parliament was convened for November 14 by President Sirisena. As the date came closer, I had few calls that asked me what the outcome could be on November 14, when parliament meets. This was one such conversation.
Asked what the outcome could be, I said, Going by the culture of political party leaders and MPs in their parties, 7 or 8 may end up in hospital.I doubt the President and the Speaker would be allowed even to take their seats But I also said, I wish sanity would prevail and that would not happen.Oh yes. They may even throw chairs the caller agreed.Isnt this the parliament you all wanted reconvened in the name of democracy and held placards I asked in jest and the phone got disconnected at the other end. Another old chum, I lost with that. The Colombo middle class wouldnt want answers that disagree with their own beliefs.
One may accept or not, but almost 3 years and 10 months with this overwhelmingly stupid formula of tying up two unholy and unprincipled political entities with a Yahapalana (good governance) label has only brought back MR. He is unavoidable and perhaps unstoppable too. It is this reality that drives the urban middle class to hide behind Constitutional clauses in the name of democracy, once again for their selfish needs.

Now the latest effort since proroguing parliament on October 26 is also about shifting MPs to create a parliamentary representation the Sirisena-Rajapaksa duo could control
The chaos and instability they helped create with their loony brand of good governance now demands a new mandate from the people, if they wish to have it. That right of the people to elect a government of their choice, the sovereignty of the people enshrined in the Constitution under Article 3 of Chapter I is inalienable and is non negotiable. It needs to be safeguarded at any cost, to avoid this crisis that can never be placated with this rowdy parliament sitting once again, even with a Supreme Court ruling. It bewilders one when these Colombo men and women who enjoy holding placards that read Our vote is not for sale and We want Democracy run to the Supreme Court, instead to the People.
Sovereignty of the people cannot be suspended for four years and six months for these MPs to trade themselves on the floor of the House. It is not me but, Eran Wickramaratne of the UNP who said a few days ago as a MP, politicians will never change the destiny of this country.and a politician, a minister told me, this system works for us. Why should we change this (check here - https://www.facebook.com/1398478163/posts/10213631340963346/).
This parliament therefore should stand dissolved for people to elect a new government,with one single Amendment to the Constitution included within two weeks from the first day of sittings, as pre condition for elections. An amendment to Recall an MP, who 1,000 voters in the district with their signatures inform the NEC their trust and representation has been breached by that MP and therefore they need to elect a new representative. Thats what sovereignty should mean for people. Not SC rulings, however enlightening they could be on technicalitiesof law.

Stan Lee, Marvel Comics' Real-Life Superhero, Dies at 95
	
Stan Lee, the legendary writer, editor and publisher of Marvel Comics whose fantabulous but flawed creations made him a real-life superhero to comic book lovers everywhere, has died. He was 95.
Lee, who began in the business in 1939 and created or co-created Black Panther, Spider-Man, the X-Men, the Mighty Thor, Iron Man, the Fantastic Four, the Incredible Hulk, Daredevil and Ant-Man, among countless other characters, died early Monday morning at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, a family representative told The Hollywood Reporter.
Kirk Schenck, an attorney for Lee's daughter, J.C. Lee, also confirmed his death.
Lee's final few years were tumultuous. After Joan, his wife of 69 years, died in July 2017, he sued executives at POW! Entertainment  a company he founded in 2001 to develop film, TV and video game properties  for $1 billion alleging fraud, then abruptly dropped the suit weeks later. He also sued his ex-business manager and filed for a restraining order against a man who had been handling his affairs. (Lee's estate is estimated to be worth as much as $70 million.) And in June 2018, it was revealed that the Los Angeles Police Department had been investigating reports of elder abuse against him.
On his own and through his work with frequent artist-writer collaborators Jack Kirby, Steve Ditko and others, Lee catapulted Marvel from a tiny venture into the world's No. 1 publisher of comic books and, later, a multimedia giant.
In 2009, The Walt Disney Co. bought Marvel Entertainment for $4 billion, and most of the top-grossing superhero films of all time  led by Avengers: Infinity War's $2.05 billion worldwide take earlier this year  have featured Marvel characters.
"I used to think what I did was not very important," he told the Chicago Tribune in April 2014. "People are building bridges and engaging in medical research, and here I was doing stories about fictional people who do extraordinary, crazy things and wear costumes. But I suppose I have come to realize that entertainment is not easily dismissed."
Lee's fame and influence as the face and figurehead of Marvel, even in his nonagenarian years, remained considerable.
Stan Lee was as extraordinary as the characters he created," Disney chairman and CEO Bob Iger said in a statement. "A superhero in his own right to Marvel fans around the world, Stan had the power to inspire, to entertain and to connect. The scale of his imagination was only exceeded by the size of his heart."
Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige also paid tribute. No one has had more of an impact on my career and everything we do at Marvel Studios than Stan Lee," Feige said. "Stan leaves an extraordinary legacy that will outlive us all. Our thoughts are with his daughter, his family and the millions of fans who have been forever touched by Stans genius, charisma and heart.
Beginning in the 1960s, the irrepressible and feisty Lee punched up his Marvel superheroes with personality, not just power. Until then, comic book headliners like those of DC Comics were square and well-adjusted, but his heroes had human foibles and hang-ups; Peter Parker/Spider-Man, for example, fretted about his dandruff and was confused about dating. The evildoers were a mess of psychological complexity.
"His stories taught me that even superheroes like Spider-Man and the Incredible Hulk have ego deficiencies and girl problems and do not live in their macho fantasies 24 hours a day," Gene Simmons of Kiss said in a 1979 interview. "Through the honesty of guys like Spider-Man, I learned about the shades of gray in human nature."
(Kiss made it to the Marvel pages, and Lee had Simmons bleed into a vat of ink so the publisher could say the issues were printed with his blood.)
The Manhattan-born Lee wrote, art-directed and edited most of Marvel's series and newspaper strips. He also penned a monthly comics column, Stan's Soapbox, signing off with his signature phrase, Excelsior!
His way of doing things at Marvel was to brainstorm a story with an artist, then write a synopsis. After the artist drew the story panels, Lee filled in the word balloons and captions. The process became known as The Marvel Method.
Lee collaborated with artist-writer Kirby on the Fantastic Four, Hulk, Iron Man, Thor, Silver Surfer and X-Men. With artist-writer Ditko he created Spider-Man and the surgeon Doctor Strange, and with artist Bill Everett came up with the blind superhero Daredevil.
Such collaborations sometimes led to credit disputes: Lee and Ditko reportedly engaged in bitter fights, and both receive writing credit on the Spider-Man movies and TV shows. "I don't want anyone to think I treated Kirby or Ditko unfairly," he told Playboy magazine in April 2014. "I think we had a wonderful relationship. Their talent was incredible. But the things they wanted weren't in my power to give them."
Like any Marvel employee, Lee had no rights to the characters he helped create and received no royalties.
In the 1970s, Lee importantly helped push the boundaries on censorship in comics, delving into serious and topical subject matter in a medium that had become mindless, kid-friendly entertainment.
In 1954, the publication of psychologist Frederic Wertham's book Seduction of the Innocent had spurred calls for the government to regulate violence, sex, drug use, questioning of public authority figures, etc., in the comics as a way to curtail "juvenile delinquency." Wary publishers headed that off by forming the Comics Code Authority, a self-censoring body that while avoiding the heavy hand of Washington still wound up neutering adult interest in comics and stereotyping the medium as one only kids would enjoy.
Lee scripted banal scenarios with characters like Nellie the Nurse and Tessie the Typist, but in 1971, he inserted an anti-drug storyline into "The Amazing Spider-Man in which Peter Parker's best friend Harry Osborn popped pills. Those issues, which did not carry the CCA "seal of approval" on the covers, became extremely popular, and later, the organization relaxed some of its guidelines.
Born Stanley Martin Lieber on Dec. 28, 1922, he grew up poor in Washington Heights, where his father, a Romanian immigrant, was a dress-cutter. A lover of adventure books and Errol Flynn movies, Lee graduated from DeWitt Clinton High School, joined the WPA Federal Theatre Project, where he appeared in a few stage shows, and wrote obituaries.
In 1939, Lee got a job as a gofer for $8 a week at Marvel predecessor Timely Comics. Two years later, for Kirby and Joe Simon's Captain America No. 3, he wrote a two-page story titled "The Traitor's Revenge!" that was used as text filler to qualify the company for the inexpensive magazine mailing rate. He used the pen name Stan Lee.
He was named interim editor at 19 by publisher Martin Goodman when the previous editor quit. In 1942, he enlisted in the Army and served in the Signal Corps, where he wrote manuals and training films with a group that included Oscar-winner Frank Capra, Pulitzer-winner William Saroyan and Theodor Geisel (aka Dr. Seuss). After the war, he returned to the publisher and served as the editor for decades.
Following DC Comics' lead with the Justice League, Lee and Kirby in November 1961 launched their own superhero team, the Fantastic Four, for the newly renamed Marvel Comics, and Hulk, Spider-Man, Doctor Strange, Daredevil and X-Men soon followed. The Avengers launched as its own title in September 1963.
Perhaps not surprisingly, Manhattan's high-literary culture vultures did not bestow its approval on how Lee was making a living. People would avoid me like I had the plague.  Today, it's so different, he once told The Washington Post.
Not everyone felt the same way, though. Lee recalled once being visiting in his New York office by Federico Fellini, who wanted to talk about nothing but Spider-Man.
In 1972, Lee was named publisher and relinquished the Marvel editorial reins to spend all his time promoting the company. He moved to Los Angeles in 1980 to set up an animation studio and to build relationships in Hollywood. Lee purchased a home overlooking the Sunset Strip that was once owned by Jack Benny's announcer, Don Wilson.
Long before his Marvel characters made it to the movies, they appeared on television. An animated Spider-Man show (with a memorable theme song composed by Oscar winner Paul Francis Webster, of "The Shadow of Your Smile" fame, and Bob Harris) ran on ABC from 1967 to 1970. Bill Bixby played Dr. David Banner, who turns into a green monster (Lou Ferrigno) when he gets agitated, in the 1977-82 CBS drama The Incredible Hulk. And Pamela Anderson provided the voice of Stripperella, a risque animated Spike TV series that Lee wrote for in 2003-04.
Lee launched the internet-based Stan Lee Media in 1998, and the superhero creation, production and marketing studio went public a year later. However, when investigators uncovered illegal stock manipulation by his partners, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 2001. (Lee was never charged.)
In 2002, Lee published an autobiography, Excelsior! The Amazing Life of Stan Lee.
Survivors include his daughter and younger brother Larry Lieber, a writer and artist for Marvel. Another daughter, Jan, died in infancy. His wife, Joan, was a hat model whom he married in 1947.
"J.C. Lee and all of Stan Lee's friends and colleagues want to thank all of his fans and well-wishers for their kind words and condolences," a family statement read. "Stan was an icon in his field. His fans loved him and his desire to interact with them. He loved his fans and treated them with the same respect and love they gave him."
"He worked tirelessly his whole life creating great characters for the world to enjoy. He wanted to inspire our imagination and for us to all use it to make the world a better place. His legacy will live on forever."
Like Alfred Hitchcock before him, the never-bashful Lee appeared in cameos in the Marvel movies, shown avoiding falling concrete, watering his lawn, delivering the mail, crashing a wedding, playing a security guard, etc.
In Spider-Man 3 (2007), he chats with Tobey Maguire's Peter Parker as they stop on a Times Square street to read news that the web-slinger will soon receive the key to the city. You know," he says, "I guess one person can make a difference  'nuff said. (Hollywood Reporter)

Unhappy for she can no longer pocket staff pay!
	
There is a wife of a former purohita who has got more upset over the latters five-member private staff losing their monthly pay than her husband losing his portfolio.

The reason for her dismay is that she had been helping herself to the lion share of the private staffers monthly pay leaving only a pittance to be distributed among them, and now she could no longer carry on this game.
She had made a practice of paying less than half the pay to these poor staffers, who had to take this injustice lying down for they had to retain their job at any cost, they say.
Nowadays this woman is reportedly pressing her husband to switch his political party to secure a portfolio in the new regime.

Voiceless minority  at Court of  last resort
	
New CJ New Hope for Speedy Redress
	20 percent of the Sri Lankan population is limited in mobility
	PIL in Court seeking orders for change
	Accessibility of differently abled in Sri Lanka still remains a pressing social issue

Fervent Accessibility Rights Activist Dr Ajith C. S. Perera, Hony Chief Executive of IDIRIYA, has moved the Court to re-activate invocation of a Fundamental Rights Public Interest Litigation of utmost importance to Sri Lanka- nationally and internationally.
Its main purpose is to seek redress for a most vulnerable and fast increasing, VOICELESS and UNDERPRIVILEGED marginalised group of persons with limited mobility, estimated at 20% of Sri Lankas population.
The subject matter here concerns continual poor compliance with laws and a Court Order on Accessibility made 12 years ago.
This results in continual infringement of the inherent Rights of nearly 4 mn people who are unable properly to access even NEW Buildings and facilities.
Pereras Motion is supported by FOUR Affidavits - one by himself and three by other eminent Sri Lankans.
He has appealed for an order from the Supreme Court to strengthen the earlier order dated 27 April 2011 issued under SCFR 221/2009.
(i). In view of the UN Convention for the Protection of the Rights of People with Disabilities (CRPD) being RATIFIED by Sri Lanka on 08 February 2016, the need for implementation of this legally binding agreement is urgent. We have already been found in default of our obligations to comply with the international law, when compliance would be easy to achieve starting with Article 9 - Accessibility.
AND
(ii). The fact that several major development projects - which will need to be used by future generations - are just being started, the need for action is urgent if yet more people are not to be severely disadvantaged.
The initiatives taken here by Dr Ajith Perera is thus indispensable.
New Chief Justice - New Hope
Sri Lanka now has a NEW Chief Justice. In Hon. H. N. J. (Nalin) Perera we have the most senior career judge appointed in a welcome move at the apex position as the head of the judiciary of Sri LankaIn his speech at the ceremonial sitting, he said he has a passion to be a voice to the voiceless and is sensitive towards the plight of the weakest in being inconvenienced by a case being unnecessarily dragged on.
SC Rules thus should promote speedy redress and prevent Violators tormenting Victims by dragging cases - justice delayed is justice denied.
The outcome of the last proceedings
At the last hearing on Thursday 04 October 2018, the Petitioner Dr Perera appeared in person and Senior State Counsel Rajitha Perera appeared for the Attorney General representing the Respondents before a Bench presided over by Justice Hon. Vjith K. Malalgoda PC and Justice Hon. Murdhu N.B. Fernando PC
Leave was granted to proceed for Violation of the Fundamental Rights of the Petitioner representing 4 Million underprivileged people experiencing physical impediments, guaranteed in terms of Articles 12(1), 12(4) and 14(1) of the Constitution.
During the proceedings, Dr Perera summarised and presented the following facts. The Ministry of Social Services promulgated a comprehensive detailed set of Regulations Gazetted under 1,4657/15 dated October 17, 2006.

To seek redress for a most vulnerable and fast increasing, VOICELESS and UNDERPRIVILEGED marginalised a group of persons with limited mobility, estimated at 20% of Sri Lankas population
They specify clearly the manner in which Steps, Railings, Toilets and other key Parts of all types of Buildings the public need to use in life, shall be designed and constructed enabling access and safety to persons with disabilities.
They were then passed unanimously by Parliament on March 20, 2007.
Despite valiant renewed efforts by this Ministry over 12 long years to implement these Access Regulations and in spite of an Order issued by the Supreme Court dated April 27, 2011 under SCFR 221/2009, we have seen a proliferation of NEW Buildings, being completed which still largely fail to comply with the requirements and thus continue to pose a potential threat to safety of life and loss of productive opportunities, thereby causing unwanted dependency and added burdens on society economically, socially and mentally, infringing the Rights of nearly 4 Million People.
At my own costs, I have visited personally over 30 places and have observed the correctness of cries, complaints and grievances by the Public and several Medical Practitioners.
Worst offenders include many 5 and 4-star Hotels, even numerous places of Higher Education Institutes and Universities, Private Sector Hospitals, high-end Shopping Complexes, Supermarkets and all forms of transport The Parts affected most are Toilets, Steps and Railings, Signage and Ramps at Entrances. Even the design of Tables and Desks at Receptions and in Restaurants continue to pose inaccessibility.
Perera further stressed that:
(i). The Substance in this re-activated case REMAINS the same as of 221 Application; AND
(ii). The Respondents also remain same as in SCFR: 221 I 2009; AND
(iii). The same facts stated in 2009 under 221 were taken-up on a number of occasions and, after several delays - over 2 years - when the respondents sought more time, and the Court was pleased to make an order on 27 April 2011, Perera pleaded for early disposal to this case, in view of the long-time already taken and the increasing need for urgent action for the reasons set out in his case.
However, the Bench stated they were bounded by the rules of the Court and thereby, in their opinion, had to grant Respondents further fair opportunity to submit objections or further material before this court.
Perera then reminded the Court that at the first hearing the Respondents had been given earlier two (02) weeks. Yet, the Court then granted the Respondents an adequate and reasonable time period of further SIX WEEKS (06), agreed upon by the Attorney General.
As the next hearing was first put off until January 2019 and at Pereras objections, was brought forward until 14 December, to which Perera further pleaded and appealed to expedite early disposal BEFORE 03 December, the International Day of the People with Disabilities REMINDING the Courts of this date as it marks the 70th Anniversary of the Declaration of Human Rights.
Perera further stressed that he is prepared to forget and forgive the Violators arid was Appealing for a Strengthened Order was applicable only to NEW Buildings, where there could be no excuse for failure to comply.
As a result of this continual pleading of the Petitioner Dr Ajith Perera backed by justifications of supporting facts, His Lordships Court fixed the following two dates; (i). 15 November 2018 for the next hearing and (ii). 29 November 2018 for Argument.

Excerpts of discussions withDr Perera
For a dis-Abled person - a Wheelchair user in particular - especially for those with hardly any resources, to pursue a legal battle as of a Public Interest Litigation, at a Court in Sri Lanka over extended periods of time is often a nightmare.
As such it prompted us to contact (with much difficulty) Dr Ajith Perera -
The Petitioner - to know what really inspired him to fight such a battle, amidst his own daunting daily struggles as a now unemployed paraplegic - now also a Senior Citizen.
Here below are excerpts of a discussion we had with Dr Perera, based on the contents of his Petition, Motion and Affidavits AND the outcome of the Court Hearing dated October 04, 2018.
Life is all about accessibility to what YOU need day-to-day. Accessibility, hence, is fundamental and indispensable.
Its continual denial causes loss of earning opportunities, unwanted dependency, poverty and segregation. Rules are man-made BUT should bring fast redress to the helpless victims, not kill time as violators want.
Rightly, people are outraged at continual poor accessibility at buildings and facilities as they are often a potential threat to most senior citizens and those with limited mobility or/and visually impaired.
BUT the real significant improvement will come ONLY when peoples attitudes change. The way people think and believe has the most dis-Abling impact on individuals, on society and a country.
Understanding key issues causing dis-Ability is a prerequisite to change.
It is one key reason I founded IDIRIYA in 2005 April; To put a lot of time and effort AS A TEAM to play a fundamental role to enable changing peoples minds, trying to achieve A WORLD without PREJUDICE. Acts, Regulations, Laws and Persuasions are essential and indispensable.
But, STILL, in this Country more than any of them, it is Orders of national interest issued by the Highest and Final Court - The Supreme Court - that inspire trust, boost confidence, infuse hope, generate respect and give that much needed IMPETUS to BRING A CHANGE IN PEOPLEs ATTITUDES and thereby enable to propel MEANINGFUL IMPLEMENTATION .
That is why, amidst growing hardship from many sides simultaneously, I am back here to re-start from where I stopped in 2013.

The real significant improvement will come ONLY when peoples attitudes change

When undemocratic forces pinch you hard!
	
A peaceful call for democracy was observed at Gangaramaya Temple in Colombo on November 11 (Sunday) and the event received wide media attention. (Pic AFP)

History reveals that past governments fancied the less affluent and the less educated
	One possible repercussion could be Sri Lanka being denied of the GSP Plus facility
	But so little was achieved and so much robbed during the Yahapalana regime
	Now Rajapaksa has been given wings and is expected to carry Sirisena out of the woods

Sri Lanka is a country where its people have a huge capacity to tolerate the misdeeds of politicians. Right now we are witnessing another attempt at forming a new government through a snap election, scheduled for January 5. The majority of Sri Lankans who voted for the Yahapalana Government to be formed in 2015, are infuriated as much as the UNP due to the present developments in the political scene. 
A peaceful call for democracy was observed at Gangaramaya Temple in Colombo on November 11 (Sunday) and the event received wide media attention. It seems that the elite, the educated and peace loving people of Sri Lanka have felt the pinch of the work of undemocratic forces in politics. 
The man who earned the praise of a nation for standing up against the dictatorship of Mahinda Rajapaksa has now been reduced to someone who is incapable of administrating the country. In politics we see many marriages and the one Sirisena entered into with Premier Wickremesinghe was a disaster. This is because of Wickremesinghes aristocratic ideas and the premier not giving Sirisena recognition and respect an executive president deserves. As Sirisena explained later the clash of cultures was unbearable. 
In Sri Lanka we see two sects of people; the educated and the intelligent who would take the best out of any given situation and the not so educated who wish the government to do much for them. Sirisena represents the latter. 
The countrys future is terms of moving forward or being stagnated lies in the hands of this latter group. The majority in this country have to depend on a stable Government. People sweat during the first 30 years of their lives and when they dont get much benefits from the hard earned monies frustration sets in. 
But there is another school of thought regarding the country moving forward. Take for an example the petrol formula during the Yahapalana Government. Each price revision that was made was beneficial to the Government, which meant its coffers were being strengthened. Hence there was more money to ease the debt burden of the country. But the majority of the people would want petrol at the lowest price having no regard to how such a move would affect the country. People need to understand that a prosperous country is not only one that doesnt sell off its assets to foreign countries, but one that doesnt allow its coffers to be drained by the people. The more uneducated people the country has the more money the government has to spend on them to nourish them or make them survive. 
History reveals that past governments fancied the less affluent and the less educated. This is why seasoned politicians like Mahinda Rajapaksa take time to speak to ordinary citizens and occasionally picks up a child from the crowd, just to pull at the heartstrings of the people. Actions like these for Wickremesinghe were akin to putting a grown-up on a swing at the park. Politicians like Rajapaksa still know that a kind word or two with a stranger would win him a voter! This is one vital aspect in politics which Wickremsesinghe refused to see. 
The downtrodden masses are only concerned about the fuel prices and cost of living. But the elite and business community are now on pins given that a concerned international community would initiate imposing sanctions on Sri Lanka. One possible repercussion could be Sri Lanka being denied of the GSP Plus facility in the future. The international community has denounced the manner in which Wickremesinghe was removed as Premier and the decision taken to prorogue parliament. In this backdrop the ambassadors of European Union countries together with Australia affirmed that Sri Lankas lawmakers should proceed with the vote of confidence when parliament reconvenes. But that will not be the focus now because the President has dissolved Parliament and called for snap elections, scheduled for January 5. 
The wise people, who always wear their thinking caps, know that Sirisena dissolved Parliament because it was evident to him that his ally now, Mahinda Rajapaksa, might not muster the majority support within Parliament, when it is reconvened. Rajapkasa will not have the majority support within Parliament, but knows that he only has to step on to the road and produce that grin accompanied by waving hands and sure enough he will have the numbers to propel him back to a top slot in the Government. This could be the reason why he ended his relationship with the Sri Lanka Freedom Party and took membership with the newly formed Sri Lanka Pudujana Peramuna (SLPP). Sources say that Rajapaksa is likely to contest the upcoming General Elections representing the SLPP. 
On November 8 (Thursday) the 3rd death anniversary of Ven. Sobitha Thera was commemorated at New Town Hall. If we go down memory lane it was Ven. Sobitha Thera who played a major role in organising the National Movement for Social Justice and bringing Sirisena to power. That move was initiated because both the UPFA and UNP had failed by then to ensure good governance, despite having other achievements. 
Sirisena looked a neutral person and the best bet to put the country on the right path, a few years after the war concluded in 2009. But so little was achieved and so much robbed during the Yahapalana regime with examples being the Central Bank Bond Issue and commencing work on the Central Express Highway without adhering to proper tender procedures. 
All this points to one thing and that is Sri Lankas voters forced to see the same old faces of politicians popping up at each election, often aligning with a new party or alliance. Rajapaksa who was bad and ousted suddenly saw himself in the hot seat, thanks to Sirisena. Now Rajapaksa has been given wings and is expected to carry Sirisena out of the woods in this crisis situation. In the future a Government possibly headed by Rajapaksa would see Sirisena being incorporated, in return for gratitude. Politicians know for sure how to maintain the you scratch my back and Ill scratch yours tradition. 
Sri Lankan voters will have to tolerate all this unless they learn to choose their representatives in parliament using their heads instead of their hearts! The islanders now have a golden opportunity to do so, come the General Elections in January.
