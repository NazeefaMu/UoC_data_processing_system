A live hand grenade manufactured in a foreign country was recovered from a swimming pool of an international school in Nugegoda today, police said.

The police who searched the premises following information received by them had found the grenade and called the bomb disposal unit of the army who had detonated it at a nearby playground.

The police are investigating as to how the bomb which could have wreaked havoc unless recovered by the police had come to the swimming pool and suspect that somebody might have brought it there in order to use for a crime.
