In line with the bank’s 78th anniversary, Bank of Ceylon (BOC) opens new Ran Kekulu accounts and makes the initial deposit of Rs.250 to all babies born during August 1 and December 31, 2017.


The parent or guardian only has to visit the nearest BOC branch within three months from the date the baby was born. Apart from this offer, if the customer is willing to enhance the investment into his/her child’s account, the bank will reward the baby with an equal sum of money up to a maximum of Rs.1000, till August 31, 2017.


The minimum deposit amount to obtain this offer is Rs.500. The offer is also valid for BOC Athfal children’s savings account.


The trust and stability grown over 78 years as the leading bank in the Sri Lankan banking industry, attests BOC’s assurance towards building a financially stable future for your child. 


BOC offers the country’s premier children savings account, Ran Kekulu, with an additional interest rate of one percent. This account is also linked with a free life insurance cover for the parent or guardian to a maximum of Rs.500,000 (minimum balance of Rs.5000 to be maintained for a period of six months prior to the incident). Any parent or guardian who opened BOC Ran Kekulu accounts for more than one child will be covered up to a maximum of Rs.1.0 million.


The child will also get a free medical insurance cover up to Rs.100,000 per annum. In case of an accident or specified 10 critical illnesses, requiring hospitalization in a private hospital for more than one night or three nights in a government hospital, the child will receive Rs.600 per day up to a maximum of 30 days only (conditions apply).


As the bank that is committed to contributing to the social and economic development of the country, BOC takes a special interest investing in the younger generation. The bank believes that every child should grow in a financially secured surrounding that ensures he/she is educated, nourished and safeguarded. With this aim BOC’s Ran Kekulu account offers timely gift promotions as the child grows and conducts programmes such as BOC Ran Kekulu scholarship awards to encourage studies.
