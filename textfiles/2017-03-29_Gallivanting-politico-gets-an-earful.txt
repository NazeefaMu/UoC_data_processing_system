A powerful young purohita in yahapalanaya received a severe reprimand from Number One the other day.

 


This young purohita from Rajarata, who by the way, handling a big secretarial job in his party, had been found doing more globe-trotting than any productive work in his office in the recent past.


On hearing about the purohita’s endless foreign jaunts draining a sizable amount of public funds, Number One had taken him to task at a recent meeting of the top team. The young purohita cut a sorry figure, when he could not find plausible reasons for making the foreign jaunts, they say. 


Number One finally warned the young Rajarata politico to put an end to his gallivanting round the world and buckle down to the job he has been assigned, 
they say.
