Former Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran had not reported to the CID so far even though he was ordered to appear before the CID on or before February 15 by the Court to record statements into the Magisterial Inquiry conducted over the Bond Auction held on February 27, 2015, sources said.

Earlier, Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne ordered Arjuna Mahendran to appear before the CID before 15 February and directed the CID to send the notice via Singapore International Police to Mahendran's residence as he was currently residing in Singapore. (Shehan Chamika Silva)
