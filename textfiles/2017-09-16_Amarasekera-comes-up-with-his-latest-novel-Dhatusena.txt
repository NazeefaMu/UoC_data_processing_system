The latest novel by Gunadasa Amarasekera is based on the life and times of King Dhatusena. The king was one of the six rulers of Sri Lanka who liberated the country from foreign invaders. He waged a 30-year-war against Tamil invaders. The novel is an attempt to view this period from today’s viewpoint. The reader will find many similarities between that period and the present times, when the country is facing its biggest threat since Independence.   


Apart from its relevance to the present, the book is an attempt to delve into the depths of the human mind through the minds of those characters as surmised by The Mahavamsa. The book is published by Visidunu Prakashakayo and will be available at the Colombo International Book Fair.
