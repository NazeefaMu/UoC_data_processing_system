CONTRADICTIONS!!!


	



 



This column has carried all of the contradictions that are being carried today, but with a purpose!!! For the past three years, we hardly heard of our President making strides in the international arenas while remaining completely oblivious to what was happening at home!!! Both the President and the Prime Minister concur that they are concerned about the economic problem but, not to the extent that they cease their jaunts out of the country!!! Ranil is touring the world and it looks like a now or never before it is too late; he has hardly come back from one country when he is off to another!!! Our Northern Province Governor Reginald Cooray had said: “Deterioration of Parliamentary standards reflects overall political chaos.” Well said Sir, thanks to our erstwhile politicians there is total chaos in the country!!!

Both the President and Premier are of the opinion that restricting imports of vehicles and foodstuff will be a solution to the economic crisis, but apparently, they have no moral right to do so. They have both imported vehicles worth Rs. 600 million, as Head of State and Prime Minister they can, but what you and I don’t know is the duty component here that contributes to the Rs. 600 million!!! Additionally, they had better let the people know that there are no free helicopter rides to Parliament, as alleged in somepapers!!! Also, stopping imports is no way to face the economic crisis!!!

 

 

 



At last

The increasing crime rate in the country is most reprehensible but the PM said last week that the crime rate had dropped while the Women and Children’s Bureau alone recorded a steep increase in crime!!! As this column has repeatedly pointed out, cases are always delayed or postponed and, according to the Justice Minister herself, there are 750,000 cases pending in Courts!!! Astronomical proportions of judicial delays!!! An Open Warrant has now been issued on Jaliya Wickramasuriya; what may we ask were the FCID doing all this time??? Jaliya is apparently conveniently following a course when he should be here in Sri Lanka behind bars!!! First, he was granted leave for medical treatment, which was also a fiasco and he failed to return; SO WHAT IS THE FCID DOING AND WHY IS IT TAKING SO LONG TO THROW THE BOOK AT ONE MAN??? Portfolio for Ravi??? That would be the biggest miscarriage of Justice!!! The burning question remains unanswered!!!

 

 



Lone voice   

One civic-conscious Minister, Nimal Siripala de Silva, has pointed out the absolute necessity to bring in new laws to prevent road accidents as they are taking a huge toll on our roads!!! We dealt with this issue before too but to no avail!!! Where have all the right-thinking, right-minded people gone, that they cannot see the crying need for stringent laws and heavy punishments to prevent the gruesome quota of road accidents and deaths of elephants???

 

 



Ice Police   



Our Police Department is in shambles beginning with allegations levelled against the IGP himself who has said he would resign!!! DIGs involved in high profile cases, Sergeants going berserk, CID submitting wrong evidence!!! Where can the common man look, if not to the Police Department when seeking JUSTICE??? When are we going to have a Police Department that we can look up to and have faith in??? The country is embroiled in crime with the Sri Lanka Cricket Fraud alone amounting to US$ 5.5 million and the IGP directed the CID to take over the investigations!!! In whom can the people repose their faith and trust???

 

 



Protocols   



Moving on to the absolutely ridiculous and a breach of diplomatic protocol, HIS EXCELLENCY THE AMBASSADOR TO QATAR A.S.P. LIYANAGE, acted as the porter cum bag carrier to the sons of MR when the Sri Lanka Rugby team arrived in Qatar!!! Apparently, Liyanage’s appointment to Qatar raised many an eyebrow but he was appointed anyway!!! Without discharging his diplomatic duties, he is noted for getting involved in matters that do not concern him!!! Liyanage’s posting in Qatar was taken up in Parliament recently!!!

 

 

 



Decent Politician   

The President has cautioned teachers to be realistic and compassionate with children who fail the Grade 5 Scholarship examinations, as children need understanding and not recriminations!!!

Having said this, we feel that Principals and teachers owe it to the children under their care to teach them that politicians with demented minds and sullied characters are people who should be avoided and not looked up to in our society!!!

Fortunately, we do have politicians with decent minds and excellent character, whom they could emulate and these politicians should be invited to their prize distributions and other celebrations; the children deserve that and should be encouraged to meet them, speak to them and try to emulate them, as far as possible!!! Young minds need to be nurtured from the beginning and set on the correct path and, as guardians of these minds, Principals and teachers have this moral responsibility!!!
