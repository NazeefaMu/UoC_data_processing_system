Debris from missing Myanmar military plane, with 116 persons aboard, found in sea, said reports. The plane had gone missing between Southern city of Myeik and Yangon.

Six ships and three planes were pressed into search and rescue operations of the crashed plane. The plane had lost contact with the radar about 20 miles west of Dawei town, reports quoted a military official as saying. It lost contact around 7:05 GMT.

The plane was reportedly carrying 105 passengers and 11 crew. In 2014, Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 disappeared on March 8, 2014, while flying from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.

The aircraft, a Boeing 777-200ER operated by Malaysia Airlines, last made voice contact with air traffic control when it was over the South China Sea, less than an hour after takeoff. In 2016, an unidentified plane was thought to have plunged into the ocean close to Myanmar.

The search for that plane was later called-off after the aviation department did not receive any reports of missing aircraft from airlines operating in Myanmar airspace. (oneindia)
