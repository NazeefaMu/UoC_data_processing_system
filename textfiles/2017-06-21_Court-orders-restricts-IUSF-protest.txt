Court orders restricts IUSF protest


	

The Colombo Fort Magistrate today issued an order preventing the Inter University Students Federation (IUSF) causing public nuisance or forcibly entering Government offices during its scheduled protest today.

The order was issued by the Magistrate following a petition filed by Colombo Fort OIC to the effect that the IUSF had continued to cause public nuisance though the students had been given court order not to do so.   

In his petition, the OIC said the area outside the Fort Railway Station had been previously allocated to the IUSF to hold protests, but he said that the student union had failed to limit their protests to the given area. (Yoshitha Perera)
