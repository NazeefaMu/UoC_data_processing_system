Australia's oldest cricketer dies, aged 100

Australia's oldest first-class cricketer, former NSW player Harold Stapleton, has died aged 100.
Stapleton, an allrounder who played one first-class match for NSW in 1941 before his career was cut short by the Second World War, celebrated his 100th birthday during the Sydney Test against India in January. Stapleton marked the occasion with friends and family in Wollongong while the milestone was acknowledged on the scoreboard at the SCG, a match Stapleton watched on television with his nephew Kevin. He was given a gift of a signed Australian Test shirt by Cricket Australia.
