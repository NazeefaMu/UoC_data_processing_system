Solar Sunbathing - You can make a difference

When you go to a Jetwing hotel like Jetwing Lagoon not only do you get the best possible leisure experience along with stunning views of the lagoon on one side and the Indian Ocean the other, you also get to rest your mind and soul on the peaceful understanding that you're at one with your environment through your tacit investment in a hotel that has strong respect for and commitment to preserving it for generations to come.
Blissfully unaware
When you arrive at the hotel to the sound of pounding waves from the beach opposite the entrance with a sunset to die for and then enter through its gates to a view of the longest pool in Sri Lanka surrounded by beautiful landscaping and a range of wonderful accommodations. You become blissfully unaware of the considerable efforts that are being made behind the scenes to make your stay not only a healthy and rejuvenating experience with its new ayurveda treatment rooms, but also a rare one to be proud of in terms of your comparatively mouse-like carbon footprint.
The oasis-like swimming pool, which you can lounge in for as long as your heart desires, due to its amazing natural disinfection system using the separation of natural salt via electrolysis, whilst seeming extravagantly large at 100m long, is actually superbly efficient.
The use of local salt pans both negates the need to expensively import artificial chlorine from the Orient whilst also being kind to your eyes and saving your skin from dryness and irritation and in fact being healthy for your skin in much the same way as the Dead Sea. Five bags of salt per week are poured into the balancing tank, hidden under the garden right next to the pool, through the most unobtrusive hatch, by the highly trained team of the local staff who support the hotel and its customers in numerous ways, always taking care of their charges, that will be you, and the environment, your environment during your stay, in equal measure.
Solar panels
The pool, its bar, the Sundown bar by the beach one side and the incredible Blue Lagoon restaurant are illuminated using efficient and effective LED lighting that lasts longer and draws less energy from the 20KW array of solar power units carefully mounted on unseen areas of the beautiful terracotta roofing. This array of panels is also used to charge a large bank of batteries for lighting the hotel after sundown. Another 10KW array of solar panels are used to heat the water you bathe and wash in. Whilst the lovely cool air you feel on your shiny, maybe a tad sweaty, face as you enter your beautifully designed room is paradoxically generated by steam pressure generated by the inconspicuously sited large biomass boiler that is continuously fed luscious smelling sustainably supplied cinnamon wood from Sri Lankan farms. This boiler is less than a third of the price of a diesel generator and costs a fraction of the price of diesel to run despite needing three locally trained shift-workers to feed it 24/7. It is also used to heat water for all the site's needs after sundown when the solar panels cease to generate heat.
As you lie out next to the pool, walk its length or amble around the gardens in front of the lagoon, take a thought for the greenery around you and how its kept that way using your room's waste water recycled through a natural three stage filtration system and pumped around using solar energy.

 
Back in your room again, you will find delicious sustainably sourced fruits, such as passion fruit and bananas that help local farming. The hotel does not use fruits that it would have to import. Jetwing Lagoon was restored to keep the Geoffrey Bawa architecture built around nature and added bigger windows to use mostly natural lighting and inside the rooms plastic has been removed all together and only recycled bottles re-filled with pure water whilst toiletries are kept in rustic material cloth bags. As you leave your room again and remove your key from its holder, a timer is triggered to turn off all but the most essential services to the room.

In the restaurant you will see stunning art work on large canvases, which is made from recycled beach rubbish beaten red, blue, orange and gold into amazing abstracts. We don't expect that you will leave much of your food as it is so delicious but if you find your eyes bigger than your mouth - you need not worry as the leftover food is composted into fertiliser to grow vegetables and bananas.
High standards
The hotel hires only staff who are very highly trained to make your stay as special as possible and more than 60 percent of them live within 10km away from the hotel, so reducing the wider impact of the hotel if staff were taken from further afield. When it comes to transport, the drivers are provided with quarters when going home would be pointless, so reducing the amount of fuel wasted when commuting and ensuring a more efficient service to guests.

They also hire a full time environmentalist responsible for maintaining the high standards already achieved whilst also constantly looking to develop new ideas. In addition to this the management team looks constantly on how to think internationally, drawing on local green ideas to lower their footprint. If ever the government shuts down, Jetwing can carry on with its self sufficient systems that if other hotels adopt the same standards, it will make Negombo the green capital of Sri Lanka. Now that is worth aiming for and you the traveller can refuse to stay at places that do not set this as their primary initiative. In the end each one of us can make a difference and leave a travel footprint for future generations to follow.
