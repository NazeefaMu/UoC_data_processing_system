Former MPs who wish to seize the Mace and run around parliament can do so at the Sooriyawewa Cricket Stadium in Hambantota instead, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe told those who had gathered for an election rally held in Bandaragama on Thursday.
“Some have threatened to run around parliament carrying the Mace if they come to power. Instead, I request them to run around the Sooriyawewa Cricket Stadium built by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa,” he said.
The Prime Minister said it was up to the people to decide whether to vote for an insane candidate who assaults his supporters.
UPFA Kurunegala district candidate Salinda Dissanayake on Monday threatened to run around parliament carrying the Mace in case the UPFA won the general election and Mahinda Rajapaksa was not appointed prime minister.
