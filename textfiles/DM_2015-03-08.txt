China asks SL to protect interests of investors over Port City
	
	China has urged Sri Lanka to respect bilateral agreements and business contracts, and protect the interests of its investors following the suspension of a multi- billion-US dollar project, the Chinese Embassy said on Saturday.
	At emergency meetings with Sri Lankan Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera, Chinese Ambassador Yi Xianliang also asked the Sri Lankan side to cherish the results of mutually-beneficial cooperation between the two countries, the embassy said.
	The Sri Lankan government decided on Thursday to temporarily suspend the Colombo Port City project pending an investigative report ordered by Prime Minister Wickremesinghe. China Communications Construction Company, the Chinese firm involved in constructing the mega port city, had agreed to halt its work on the ground.
	The Association for Sri Lanka-China Social and Cultural Cooperation, a civic group in Sri Lanka, demanded the government retract its decision as the Chinese-funded Port City has created job opportunities and benefited the local economy.
	The 1.4-billion-US dollar project, which was built on reclaimed land, was part of a deal reached between Sri Lanka and China under the former Sri Lankan government. The new government which took office following elections in January had wanted a review on the project.

Frauds seem to be continuing  Harsha de Silva
	
Against the backdrop of the controversial bond issue, deputy Economic Affairs and Policy Planning Minister, Harsha de Silva said frauds in the stock exchange and the bond market seemed to be continuing.
He said he had spoken out against such manipulations and violations during the previous regime, but it had ignored his complaints.
Dr. de Silva said his ministry would investigate the bond issue.The conversation continued as follows:Reporter: Can you describe how you will investigate the controversial bond issue --- be it by the Central Bank itself or a third partyMinister: We have decided to investigate. We are yet to appoint a person or persons to carry out investigations. We have decided to do it in the coming days.Reporter: Can you let us know whether the Central Bank is carrying out any investigation on the primary dealer Perpetual TreasuriesMinister: There are a number of primary dealers and stock brokers manipulating and violating the law. In the past, I, as an opposition MP, raised this matter on multiple occasions. The previous government did not give any hearing to me about these frauds both in the bond market as well as in the stock exchange. It seems that these frauds continue just as if nothing has happened. Reporter: What is your response to the allegation that there was a conflict of interest in the involvement of the Central Bank Governor in the bond issueMinister: That is a matter to be discussed. The resignation of Arjuna Aloysius from the Director Board of Perpetual Treasuries is sufficient. We must have a fresh look at the conflict of interest  real and perceived. In the financial market, even a perceived conflict of interest matters. The two are correlated.Reporter: Why was a higher offer accepted without informing other dealers that they wanted bids for higher amountsMinister: that is not the case. Thirty odd separate bids were received for a total sum of Rs.20 billion -- ranging from Rs.8 million to Rs.5 billion and ranging from nine percent to over Rs.13 percent. In the end Rs.10 billion was taken in at the lowest rate of 9.3 percent and the highest rate of 12.5 percent. (Kelum Bandara)

Ranil drew wrong marine, fishermen parallel: India
	
	External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj has told Sri Lankan Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe that the issue of Indian fishermen intruding into Lankan waters should not be seen legally but from a humanitarian perspective.
	Taking up the explosive issue at her luncheon meeting with Wickremesinghe here on Saturday, Swaraj said the issue concerns peoples livelihood and will have to be approached in a manner that takes into account the livelihood and humanitarian needs of the fishermen of both India and Lanka.
	Briefing the Indian media at the end of Swarajs two-day visit to Lanka, External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Syed Akbaruddin said there is a fundamental difference between the Italian marines case and the Indo-Lankan fishermen issue. The former is a legal issue, while the latter is a livelihood and humanitarian one, he said.
	Swarajs plea to Wickremesinghe on the fishermen issue came in the wake of an interview the Lankan PM had given to Thanthi TV in which he had said that it is well within the Lankan Navys rights to shoot at Indian fishermen if they intrude into Lankan waters since the countrys law provides for shooting in self-defence.
	However, Wickremesinghe added that Lanka is willing to settle the fishermen issue peacefully, through talks.
	Akbaruddin said India wants the issue to be settled through talks between the fishermen of the two countries.(Indian Express)

Sanga becomes 2nd batsman to reach 14,000 ODI runs
	
	Kumar Sangakkara became the first batsman after Sachin Tendulkar to register 14,000 runs in One-Day Internationals (ODIs).
	Sangakkara needed 39 more runs to achieve the milestone when he came out to bat against Australia at Sydney Cricket Ground. The left-hander reached the landmark 14,000 runs in 14th over of Sri Lankan innings.
	Sangakkara has been in prolific touch and in his last two outings scored back to back centuries. He scored 73-ball century against Bangladesh and then against England notched another impressive hundred off 70 balls. Both his hundreds proved to be match winning ones and gave Sri Lanka a much needed direction in ICC Cricket World Cup 2015 after their poor start against New Zealand in the tournament opener.
	The twin centuries took Sangakkaras tally to 23 hundreds and he now has the most centuries for Sri Lanka after Sanath jayasuriyas 28 tons. The classy left-handed batsman features fourth on list of all-time most hundreds in ODIs. The list is topped by Tendulkar (49), followed by former Australian captain Ricky Pointing (30) and Jayasuriya on third.
	Sangakkara also became the first Sri Lankan batsman to notch up 14,000 runs in ODIs. It took him 402 matches to reach the milestone. Next on most runs for Sri Lanka list is Jayasuriya, who has 13364 runs from 441 matches. Sangakkaras long-time friend Mahela Jayawardene is the third highest run-getter for Sri Lanka with over 12, 000 runs.

Secret bank accounts in Switzerland and Saudi Arabia
	
Permission from the Switzerland and Saudi Arabian governments to check secret bank accounts of those who had deposited money swindled from development projects would be requested by the relevant authorities, Deputy Minister of Justice Sujeewa Senasinghe said in a rally in Moratuwa today.
MP Senasinghe alleged that what he called fraudulent projects, including the Mattala Airport, Hambantota Habour, and Norochcholai Coal Power Plant were launched by the former government in order to skim off money which certain persons had deposited in Swiss and Saudi Arabian bank accounts.
So far around 2000 complaints have been lodged with the BC against henchmen of previous government. In the past the BC was also full of corrupt persons. But today people are not allowed to do such things in this country, he said.
He added that the present government had appointed a new Director General of the Bribery Commission and was recruiting new inspectors to the BC under a new legal procedure in order to speed up the process of bringing the culprits to book.
According to Mr. Senasinghe, it might take six months to one year to catch the leading figures behind the corruption and bribery since the legal the accepted procedures were being adhered to by the government. (PIYUMI FONSEKA)(VIDEO BY INDIKA SRI ARAVINDA)

SL needs 377 runs to win
	
	Glenn Maxwell's lightning-quick century has propelled Australia to 6 for 376 to set Sri Lanka a formidable target in the World Cup match at the SCG.
	Maxwell fell just short of hitting the quickest-ever World Cup century, but made the milestone - his first in one-day internationals for Australia - in 51 balls, smashing a woeful Sri Lankan attack for 10 boundaries and four sixes.
	While openers Aaron Finch (24) and David Warner (9) fell cheaply, Michael Clarke showcased his value to the batting line-up with a run-a-ball 68, alongside Steve Smith (72) in a 134-run partnership for the third wicket.
	But their dismissals brought Maxwell to the crease, who along with a rejuvenated Shane Watson (67 off 41), proceeded to pummel Sri Lanka into submission.
	Australia 376 for 9 in 50 overs (Steven Smith 72, Michael Clarke 68, Glenn Maxwell 102, Shane Watson 67; Lasith Malinga 2 for 59)
