Capital Alliance Ltd (CAL) recently launched Sri Lanka’s first online bond trading app in an effort to take government securities trading to the future and make it more accessible.


Developed by Finnovation, a subsidiary of Capital Alliance that focuses on software development, CALiper is a state-of-the-art digital app that facilitates online bond trading with the click of a button.
Capital Alliance is a leading investment bank which offers a broad spectrum of integrated investment and capital market solutions to its diversified client base. Since its inception in 2000, Capital Alliance’s focus on providing innovative and integrated solutions tailored to meet the needs of its customers has enabled it to build a reputation as a preferred partner in financial markets. Today, the company is headed by D. A. Zoysa, who serves on the boards of Capital Alliance Holdings Limited and Capital Alliance Limited as Chairman.


Geared to meet the needs of the future, whilst offering enhanced transparency, CALiper was designed to give investors the ability, freedom and flexibility to trade bonds based on their individual risk appetites and comfort levels. CALiper enables faster response times and up-to-date access to a personal portfolio, and provides all the tools needed to measure, trade, monitor and observe government securities, all in real-time from the comfort of one’s home or workplace.


Speaking at the launch event, Capital Alliance Ltd Managing Director Gihan Hemachandra stated: “There is an immense need for transparency in the bond market and CALiper will help deliver that along with more accessibility to investors. The bond market, unlike the stock market is structured as a wholesale market and a select few enjoy the benefits and returns from trading. However, with CALiper, more investors will be able to independently trade bonds live and benefit directly from the returns of trading.”


CALiper is available through a dedicated website and will be released across other devices in time to come. Commenting on the trading app, Finnovation Software Head Uthpala Dassanayake, developer of CALiper stated: “The application was developed by our team from scratch and fuses the latest Fintech solutions with a seamless design to offer a simple, fast and real-time user experience. This award winning technology fills an important void in the financial services industry and will help to demystify trading and encourage more individuals to confidently manage their portfolios, make trades on a more regular basis and strategically grow their wealth.”


The deployment of CAL’s digital innovations is part of the company’s long-term goals to be future-ready, and evolve in this ever-advancing world. The company strives to disrupt traditional models and empower its clients, and remains dedicated to offering world-class standards of service and trusted solutions that deliver high returns.


Capital Alliance Ltd takes immense pride in setting the benchmark for ethical operations and best practices throughout the organisation and in the industry at large.
