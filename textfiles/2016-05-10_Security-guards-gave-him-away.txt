This purohita is a ladies’ man whose romantic escapades are well known in political circles.

 


The other day he entered the august assembly looking pale and somber. 


A young friendly member who approached him addressed the purohita: “Sir, you look unusually sad and serious today.”


The purohita after a moment of reflection said: “I have a big problem…My wife has a suspicious mind and she has become a b…dy nuisance!”


“But there must be a reason for it!” said the young member.


“Some rascals have called her and said various things about me,” said the purohita.


“What is it about, Sir?”


“About the affairs I am supposed to be involved in.” “But, Sir, surely you can carry on with whatever affair you are interested in without her knowledge.”


“I thought so too. But my wife has, somehow, got round some security chaps to ferret out certain things.” the purohita confided in the young colleague.
