National Govt. a result of the people’s victory - PM

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said that Sri Lanka is being governed by a national government at present which was formed by the two major political parties. The national government is a result of the people’s victory of January 8 electing Maithripala Sirisena as the President of the country.
“Therefore, we all are engaging in creating a society in which all ethnic groups can enjoy equal opportunities. We plan to form this multi ethnic, multi cultural and multi religious socialist society” the Prime Minister said.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said so addressing the 12th International Science and Technology Forum in Kyoto, Japan yesterday.
The Forum was inaugurated by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.
“Every Sri Lankan will share the dividends of the Government’s transparent and accountability policies,” the Prime Minister said.
“Therefore, we need to achieve significant progress and development in the science and technology fields in order for the people to enjoy these dividends,” Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said.
“During the next 60 months, the Government plans to develop infrastructure facilities, which are required to bring out the best of the people’s creative talents,” he said.
“Sri Lanka has the ability to face any local and international challenge,” the PM said.
The Prime Minister pointed out that Sri Lanka’s policy is to maintain cordial and friendly ties with all countries.
“I hope to introduce ‘Technological Zones’ and megapolis concepts to the country,” he said.
The Prime Minister noted that Sri Lanka has to have a technological collaboration with Japan to make those concepts a reality. While pointing out the ways to utilise the benefits of technological collaboration, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said that developing countries are trying to achieve 17 development goals aiming to obtain sustainable development.
“In this exercise, Japanese technology plays a pivotal role,” he added.
