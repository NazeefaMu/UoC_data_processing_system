Anyone doing business with Iran will not do business with US:Trump


	

Donald Trump has thrown down the gauntlet, warning that any businesses trading with Iran would not be allowed to trade with the US.

Hailing the re-introduction of sanctions against the state, the US President tweeted: "These are the most biting sanctions ever imposed, and in November they ratchet up to yet another level. Anyone doing business with Iran will NOT be doing business with the United States."

He added: "I am asking for world peace, nothing less!"

His comments come just a day after the European Union said it was implementing a blocking statute to shield companies "doing legitimate business" within the country against the impact of US sanctions coming into force as a result of Trump's decision to withdraw from the multilateral Iran nuclear deal.

The blocking statute will allow EU companies to recover damages resulting from US sanctions and ban them from complying with sanctions unless they get special dispensation from the European Commission.

Under the deal Iran agreed to drastically scale back its nuclear programme in return for relief from sanctions introduced by the international community over fears it was developing nuclear weapons.

But Trump has repeatedly slammed it as a bad deal for the US. Yesterday he claimed his new approach was "based on a clear-eyed assessment of the Iranian dictatorship, its sponsorship of terrorism, and its continuing aggression in the Middle East and all around the world". (cityam)
