People who did not have any knowledge about cricket had destroyed the Sri Lankan national team, former Sri Lankan Cricket Captain, Petroleum Resources Development Minister Arjuna Ranatunga said.

Ranatunga was the captain of Sri Lankan cricket team that won the 1996 ICC World Cup.

“I will remain silent, as Sports Minister Faiszer Musthapha knows the subject well. But I will break the silence and make the team better perform under a different political leadership in future,” he said.

He said so attending the publishing of book 'Sellam da Sellam' authored by Thameera Manju at the BMICH.

The writer Thameera Manju is a Journalist and the current Media Secretary to the Minister.

Minister Ranatunga hinted that the Sports Minister Musthapha knew the game and its rules better than him.

“Faiszer knows the cricket and the rules better. Therefore, I will leave the business to him and stay silent. But I will take up the game under a different Government,” he said.

Minister Ranatunga, saying that he would never accept the portfolio of Sports Minister, however, said that he would accept Sri Lanka Cricket only under a different political leadership and that within six months he would show a difference.

“I am not in a position to accept that responsibility now as I hold another responsibility,” he said.

“I’m not greedy. No one can challenge that I cannot oversee cricket and no one has the right than I do.

“Today players are not allowed to be a member of the cricket administration. Several individuals have destroyed the cricket in Sri Lanka. It was a shame to say that Sports Ministers have also support that,” he said.

Minister Ranatunga added that the public would provide the correct answers to all of them during future elections. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
