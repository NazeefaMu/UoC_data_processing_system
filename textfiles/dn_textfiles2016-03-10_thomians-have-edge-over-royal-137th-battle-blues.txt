Thomians have edge over Royal in 137th Battle of the Blues

 
S. Thomas’ should have a thin edge over their traditional rivals Royal in their 137th Battle of the Blues three-day cricket encounter which starts at the SSC grounds today.
Both teams look almost equal on paper, though the unbeaten Thomians have won more matches than their opponents this season. That would put S. Thomas’ on a psychologically advantageous position than their big match rivals from Reid Avenue. The match is sponsored by Dialog Axiata.
Never in the long history of Thomian cricket have they registered so many wins during a single season. Sachitha Jayatilleke and his boys from Mount Lavinia will march to the big match as the most successful Thomian team ever, having won seven matches outright. They would have well extended this record to over ten wins if rain had not interfered in at least five matches which the Mount Lavinia boys had dominated. Royal too have played an equal number of matches (21) this season but have three wins to their credit while losing the last game to Trinity.
Royal captain Geeshanth Panditharatne expressed confidence in his team and said that they would go all out to make their presence felt. “We are strong both in batting and bowling. We have two batsmen who have aggregated over 1,000 runs each and a bowler who has captured over 100 wickets this season. They would spearhead the Royal attack, with the help of the others in the team,” he said.
Asked about their defeat against Trinity which spoilt their unbeaten record, Panditharatne said it was one bad day in which his boys were off-colour. “That was an eye-opener and we are fully focused now,” he said. But the Royal captain said that the Reid Avenue boys may even opt to field first if they win the toss, although the SSC wicket looks good for batting. “If we could make use of early life in the wicket, our pacies could come on top,” he added.
S. Thomas’ coach Dinesh Kumarasinghe looked a confident man as his team completed their final work out. “We have a good chance, going by the form the team has shown during the season. I am not underestimating the Royal side. But when we compare the two teams, Royal have mainly depended on a few individuals who have completed 1,000 runs or 100 wickets. In contrast, almost every member of the Thomian team has contributed to the team’s success,” Kumarasinghe said.
Thomian skipper Jayatilleke, while endorsing his coach’s views, said that his team should hold the key to the latest edition of the Battle of the Blues. “We are confident. At the same time, we will not underestimate our opponents in any way. We will make our presence felt,” a determined S. Thomas’ captain said.
Royal coach Suranga Wijenayake said the team which makes the least number of mistakes could win the match. “It all depends on what you dish out in the big match, making the least amount of mistakes. If we bat first, we target a total of around 350 runs. If we field first, we must restrict the Thomian innings below 200 runs. Those are our initial targets,” he said.
It will be a tough task for Thomian bowlers to stop Royal batsmen from going for their favourite strokes. Royal batsmen are in cracking from with skipper Panditharatne (1,039 runs), deputy Thiran Dhanapala (1,107), opener NaveenVidanapathirana (853), Ronuka Jayawardena (694) and Pasindu Sooriyabandara (648) often making their willows to do the talking.
Undoubtedly, the cynosure of all eyes will be Royal’s left-arm spinner Lasith Embuldeniya - the leading wicket taker in school cricket for the season with 118 scalps. With support coming from Ganith Sandeepa and Himesh Ramanayake, the Thomian batsmen may not have a smooth sailing.
S.Thomas’ too have a strong batting line up which could turn dangerous if they bat first and survive the early life on the wicket. Rashmika Opatha (832), vice-captain Yohan Mendis (770), skipper Jayatilleke (758), Ravindu Kodituwakku (704) and Dilendra Gunatilleke (691) have lavishly contributed with the bat. Sri Lanka U-19 player Ravindu Tillekaratne, son of former Sri Lanka captain Hashan Tillakaratne, will add more power to the Thomian line-up.
Since its inception way back in 1879, the two teams have met in 136 uninterrupted encounters and have 34 wins each with the rest drawn. Whatever the result one thing is guaranteed – that the great game of cricket would be played in an exemplary manner, in its true spirit.
