	Spectators trying to enjoy the New Zealand vs Sri Lanka Twenty20 cricket match at Eden Park seem to have their eyes on something else.
	Twitter and Facebook are rife with accusations security guards are acting as the "fun police" and being too hard on fans, confiscating musical instruments and kicking people out.
	Witnesses have reportedly seen Sri Lankan fans being escorted from the ground by police and security guards.
	In video footage they can be heard booing as security moves in on a group of fans.
	A spectator, who didn't want to be named, said security guards were hanging around a group of Sri Lankan supporters near the boundary. About six of them had been evicted.
	"They seem loud but well behaved and self contained," he said.
	Another spectator, Hayden Eastmond-Mein, said security were being over the top and taking extreme measures.
	"I saw security guards confiscating a number of small drums from Sri Lankan fans," he said. "It seemed really heavy handed and over the top. The big group of Sri Lankans they were targeting were just having a good time and providing most of the atmosphere in what can be a pretty dull stadium"
	To add insult to injury, the half-time entertainment was a group of samba drummers who walked straight past the group of Sri Lankan fans, he said.
	"I don't blame the individual guards, they're obviously just following inflexible rules that are supposedly about safety - but they just serve to make Eden Park a dull, fun-free zone."
	Police communications staff said they did not have any information about the reported incidents. (stuff.co.nz)
