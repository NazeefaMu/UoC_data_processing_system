A considerable number of MPs are reported to have gone abroad to spend their Christmas holidays.

The United National Party (UNP) working committee meeting which was to be held on Thursday had to be postponed because most of its MPs were abroad.

“Most of them have gone abroad for the holidays,” a newly-appointed State minister said and added that even several Opposition MPs were abroad. (Yohan Perera)
