Why? Oh! Why?


	



The senior purohita long aspiring to wear the prime ministerial mantle rang up his astrologer -  a fair one – soon after his latest disappointment. 

 


 Highly dismayed and dejected that the much coveted plum job was almost within his reach this time round when it was suddenly snatched away, the man turned to the faithful astrologer for solace.  After all, numerous Poojas and other rituals conducted on her advice and guidance should produce some result, he thought. 


He wanted to know why certain bigwigs who held out hope for him let him down at the eleventh hour. “Why? Oh! Why?” he lamented.


The woman who got on the defensive had explained quoting chapter and verse that his own misconduct had sent   all her settings awry. As the woman began giving a list of his faults and foibles, the purohita had rung off saying that they could discuss all that later, they say.
