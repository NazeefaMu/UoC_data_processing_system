Being generous at public expense
	

A story doing rounds in public administration circles says that a white-collar high-up functioning directly under a high political authority connected to trade is reportedly giving some of his favorites acting appointments in addition to their substantive positions as a ploy to give them unjust perks.

For examples, three assistant directors of a certain establishment have been appointed as acting directors as a ruse to extend to them certain perks like official vehicles.
The white-collar high-up is making irregular appointments to offer various perks to his favorites using the clout he wields thanks to his close connection to a high political authority, they say.

Blissfully ignorant of the reality
	

This politico is a former chief provincial purohita. He has made it a practice to visit a certain political leader in the South once in every two or three months with a large basket of fresh vegetables.

Sir, these vegetables are genuine produce from the crops we raise in our home garden using organic farming. We dont use even a wee-bit of chemical fertilizers, the politico would tell the Southern leader while presenting the basket of vegetables.
However, sources close to the chief purohita say that the latter would spend an hour or two shopping at a supermarket the day before he made the regular visit to the political heavyweight in the South.
By the way, the leader in the South hates vegetables grown using chemical fertilizer, they say.

Bonsai - Beauty of a living art
	

When the artistic forms of Bonsai trees are displayed at exhibitions, many enthusiastic viewers get a desire to try out creating a Bonsai. A beginner, could be slightly nervous of some of the techniques used, but in no time, one can gain confidence as he /she sees how the trees respond to the training. With growing confidence, new ideas can be experimented, some will succeed, and some may fail. But, with each failure, you will learn how to go ahead with the task of creating a sculpture out of a living specimen. 
A careful analysing of a tree leads one to understand its life story and the conditions under which it grew over the years. As an example, mountain trees grow in thin poor soil, and are exposed to strong winds. Their life is a constant battle for survival under the harsh realities of nature. However, such battle will give them their unique character, with very special attractive features. 
A bonsai artist will also have to learn the process of a young plant turning out to an old tree, shedding many branches, leaving the essential stronger ones, strong surface roots becoming a part of the picture, giving stability and a mature look.
The age of a Bonsai is not that important. What matters in a Bonsai, is the true quality of the specimen. How beautiful it is, how natural it looks It is the beauty of form, colour and texture, which matters. It is a fact that the beauty of the tree will improve with the length of time it had been trained as a Bonsai. But unless the basic form is of quality, ageing itself will not make it a good Bonsai. 
The size of a Bonsai is also not an important factor. Many believe that the larger the Bonsai, the better it is, which is not true. It is also assumed that bigger Bonsai are more difficult to create, which is also not true. It can be argued that a mini or Mame Bonsai will require more patience and skills to create and maintain, because the same aesthetic standards have to be achieved with fewer and smaller elements.
A careful analysing of a tree leads one to understand its life story and the conditions under which it grew over the years

Bonsai artists all over the world, exhibit their creations at the exhibitions conducted by their respective Associations/ Clubs, and these exhibitions give an opportunity to the general public to appreciate and study this very special art. In Sri Lanka, the Sri Lanka Bonsai Association conducts such annual Bonsai exhibitions.
A large collection of high quality Bonsai plants created by the members of the Sri Lanka Bonsai Association will be on display, at their Annual Exhibition Reflections  2018 at the J.D.A.Perera Gallery, University of Visual & Performing Arts, No.46, Horton Place, Colombo 07, on 4th May (from 12.00 a.m. to 6.30 p.m.) and on 5th and 6th May 2018 (from 9.30 a.m. to 6.30 p.m.).
Demonstrations will be held at 4.00 p.m. on 4th, 5th & 6th May and at 11.00 a.m. on 5th & 6th May 2018.

FB ushers in age of Responsible Facebooking
	
Comprehensive Community Standards Introduced
Facebook has decided to refine and make their guidelines understandable to the public
Facebook has its own description of a nude picture
This difficulty in identifying doesnt arise with regard to a video
It is difficult to identify content as being aggressive or violent because it is written
Although FB users stumble upon content including hate speech or sensitive content, not all users will go to the extent of reporting them

When Facebook (FB) was first introduced after the Hi5 and Messenger revolutions, the youth were mesmerised by its glamour and various other options. From adding people you know to sharing your ideas, it became a global platform for people to connect, free-of-charge. In no time, Mark Zuckerberg became a hero among the global community. With gradual changes, Facebook became a point of discussion and debate as it was open to anyone. People of all ages and various intentions started using FB, some to do good and some with ulterior motives on their minds.
At the onset of the recent violent incidents in Kandy District, FB fanned more flames than expected, thus forcing the Government to censor all social media sites till the matter was resolved. Taking this issue and various other matters which led to hate speech and violence from around the world into consideration, Facebook has decided to refine and make their guidelines understandable to the public. In doing so, the team believes that they would be able to convince the public to play a role in allowing them to realise their mistakes and upgrade their service. 
Hence theDailymirror sheds light on the users responsibilities and why content should be reported even if it doesnt concern you or someone you know. 
We will update content regularly and ensure that the public understands it-
In an exclusive newsroom call with the , Facebooks Head of Product Policy and Counter-terrorism, Monika Bickert elaborated on the recently launched Internal Enforcement Guidelines for Community Standards. The standards that we have are Community Standards. I have worked and visited several places in Asia and when I came to Facebook six years ago, Community Standards were already there and they were of a high level. They said we dont support harassment, bullying etc., but we didnt give a lot of detail about what we meant. We heard questions about people all the time and about what we meant. By 2015 we came out with a more detailed version of how we define some of these concepts such as hate speech. But we didnt reveal all the details and we continued to receive questions from people about how we enforce these policies. For instance when it comes to harassment we would define something, so we would explain how we tell our content reviewers to enforce the policy. But today we are giving more importance to these policies and making them public. We are going to make sure that these policies are understandable to the audience and our goal is to make sure that when the public see the content they could look at the policies to understand and review our content. If not they will understand with reasons. We are also launching an appeal process for individual pieces of content. If there are certain pieces of content that should be removed we do have the opportunity to request for a review. We recognize that we make mistakes and we are trying to give our community an opportunity to play a role in the process and analyse these mistakes. So if the content should be removed the information goes to our operations team and if we find out that we have made a mistake we do make it a point to make sure that the content is restored. Bickert said. 
More users equal to more changes
Speaking further Bickert however mentioned that this is not a final version of the FB Content Policy because the Policy continues to evolve. Part of that is because we see more and more people on Facebook and there are different communities around the world. For instance there are speech issues that continue to change. So we are always hearing about new trends and things that we need to include in our Policy. We have a meeting which we call the Content Standards Forum where people from all different teams of Facebook from all over the world come together and discuss certain issues that we see in different parts of the world. Here we check the possibilities of refining our Policy. So, somebody from the Australian team might see a new self-harm trend among young people in Australia and then we would take a decision to view the activities happening in Australia. Then we look at the data and the content on our servers and find out the information offline about their trends and we will talk to academics about this problem around the world and we will get their inputs about how to refine our Policy to best address whatever the new issue is. So from now on wards we will regularly update the content; maybe every month. One of the goals of this launch is to obtain feedback from the community. We have been reaching out to civil society organisations and academics to obtain their feedback on these Policies. So from now onwards, anybody can report any piece of content on Facebook and this could be a profile, a photo, a post etc. This report goes to a member of our Community Operations Team and they are the reviewers who are based around the world. There are over 75,000 of them who continue to grow and they speak many languages and we want to make sure that we respond quickly to the reports that we obtain from the people. We get millions of requests within a week and we try to review the majority of them within 24 hours. In terms of hate speech and harassment, a lot of this bad behaviour comes from people who use fake accounts. They are not using their real names and they are using their accounts to abuse other people. Therefore our technical tools to identify fake accounts are getting a lot better. We see over a million fake accounts every day. We will have an Image Matching software and various other tools for this purpose. During the recent French and German elections for instance we removed tens of thousands of fake accounts using these new tools,she elaborated. 
With gradual changes, Facebook became a point of discussion and debate as it was open to anyone. People of all ages and various intentions started using FB, some to do good and some with ulterior motives in their minds
Customised Terms and Conditions
In his comments to the Dailymirror, Senior Information Security Engineer at the Sri Lanka Computer Emergency Readiness Team (CERT) Roshan Chandraguptha said that on social media, every site has its own terms and conditions. On Facebook they have their Community Standards which is not available on other social media. On other sites, their terms and conditions might reflect their laws and cultures. Therefore they address our issues in a different manner. Since 2013 we have spoken to technical teams at Facebook and although they said they will look into the issues, they were never resolved. This is because they emphasized on the freedom of expression for people in countries among other reasons. But for the Asian culture they have their own concerns. These issues exist because people use Facebook for different matters.
If you use it in an ethical and a responsible manner there wont be any technical issues. If anyone tries to misuse Facebook then there will be problems. Initially when someone identifies a nude picture, Facebook has its own description of a nude picture. Therefore just because you post a photo of a girl in a swimming pool or in a bikini, according to Facebook it might not be a nude picture. If you go by another category also it might state that you are not violating the terms and conditions of Facebook. But its of concern to our people and culture, he explained. 


But problems may arise in how we identify the offences because they may not match what Facebook defines as an offence. This is also because the law in US is applicable to most social media and not the law in our country
He further said that other issues include people using Facebook to rob money, to threaten others and so on. Regarding these incidents there is a legal process in which you could obtain Subscriber Information which is held by them. If someone publishes something targeting someone or asking for ransom then any country is supposed to send a court order and obtain information from them. But problems may arise in how we identify the offences because they may not match what Facebook defines as an offence. This is also because the law in US is applicable to most social media and not the law in our country. But there are numerous instances when people use Facebook to keep in touch with friends and to promote businesses. During the time we faced an issue we came across numerous accounts owned by businesses as their marketing strategy. Therefore they were affected as a result of the censoring. In addition to that you cannot trust all the content that you see in Facebook.
If you want to find out how many planets are there in the solar system and if I think I need to come up with a website with the scientific details of the solar system I can do that. Nobody will ask me to take down the content and it is my opinion as well. Therefore if you search it on my website you will think that my opinion is correct and what others say is wrong. So we need to see if the information we obtain from the Internet comes from a reliable source. Wrong information can spread like wildfire and if you dont trust the person sharing it, then you will share that wrong information with the rest of the people in your profile, he said. 
The real issue of reporting content

Although FB users stumble upon content including hate speech or sensitive content, not all users will go to the extent of reporting them. When asked about this trend, Chandraguptha said that unless someone sees his or her own photo or a photo of a person he or she knows is being used by another account, people generally dont report content. There was an incident where some photos of girls were used by an account and those particular individuals requested us to take down the page. But we dont have the authority to do that and hence reported the page to FB. We then realised that although around 100 people have reported the page, it was liked by over 70,000 people. In that case they count only the numbers. With Community Standards FB believes that people will have their own photo and that they will not take somebody elses photo and publish it. Of course there are instances when FB was used to collect dry rations and aid during times of emergency. We also see advertisements of people who need blood donations and other assistance. If people use FB in such a way there wont be issues and nobodys life would be in danger. Unless somebody reports, FB remains as it is because it
is a community requirement, he said.




We are going to make sure that these policies are understandable to the audience and our goal is to make sure that when the public see the content they could look at the policies to understand and review our content

If we report a page or an account and they are able to remove it, it means that they have access to all accounts, Chandraguptha further said. This means they have a lot of intelligence. We need to understand that they have all our information because given that there is a court case they have to provide all necessary information. If you deactivate your account you can recover it after three months. When we create an account we agree to their Terms and Conditions which many people dont read. But if you read it you will have a better idea of what you are using. It is the users responsibility to use it wisely. It is difficult to identify content as being aggressive or violent because it is written, but this difficulty in identifying doesnt arise with regard to a video. This in turn makes it difficult to identify such posts to have violated terms and conditions of FB. Therefore users have a bigger responsibility in using FB wisely, he said.

Gaza protesters gunshot injuries unusually severe: Medics
	

Gaza, (rt.com), 26 April 2018 - The injuries sustained by Gaza protesters at the hands of Israeli troops during the ongoing Great March of Return are unusually severe, doctors say, adding they have seen nothing similar since the Israeli campaign of 2014.

Half of the more than 500 patients we have admitted in our clinics have injuries where the bullet has literally destroyed tissue after having pulverized the bone, Marie-Elisabeth Ingres, head of mission of Doctors Without Borders (MSF) in Palestine, said in a report released last week. 
The international medical group stressed that its doctors treated a number of patients with devastating injuries of an unusual severity who will have to undergo complex surgical operations.
The majority of the victims will have serious and long-term physical disabilities, according to the report. Some patients may yet need amputation if not provided with sufficient care in Gaza, the statement added. The medics said that large exit wounds can be the size of a fist.

The temporary ban imposed on the British surgeon preventing him from conducting surgeries, was lifted last week on a recommendation made by the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) when the GMOA claimed that the British doctor did not have a licence to practice in the United Kingdom (UK) as it needed to be renewed from time to time.
GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge told Daily Mirror that the Director General of Health Services had ordered the hospital director to lift the temporary ban without a valid ground and without conducting an inquiry despite he had guaranteed to do so.
When we inquired about the qualifications of this doctor, we found out that he only has the registration of General Medical Council (GMC) in UK and not practising rights. He was deprived of practising rights in UK in 2015 due to some reason and he had concealed it while he was producing his documents to the SLMC, he said. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

How the stethoscope tells a story
	

I remember the first time that I laid a hand on a stethoscope as a medical student. We were in the physiology lab and it was during the second year of med school. We were crowded around the tables, touching the stethoscope almost reverently, while the lecturer demonstrated how to handle it and listen to the lung and heart sounds. Then came our opportunity where we got to try and listen to the hearts of our colleagues. It was initially a disappointment, because I imagined it to carry heart sounds as loud and clear as a radio, which was my fantasy. I got a stethoscope of my own during the third year when we first got to practice with real parents. Weve gotten better at distinguishing the various sounds since then. 
The day a medical student gets to handle a stethoscope is one of the biggest and most anticipated highlights of his or her carrier. Not only does the stethoscope play a vital role in helping to identify various disease conditions, it has acted as a symbol of identification for many a generation of physicians. Todays article is about the story of the beginning and the evolution of this jewellery of physicians, which has a history of over 200 years. 
The stethoscope was invented by Dr. Ren Laennec of France, in the early 1800s. Even though the history uses the word invented, the first stethoscope was actually a rolled paper used as a tube. Up until then, the sound of the chest, if needed to be heard, were listened to by the doctor who kept his ear on the chest of the patient. Dr. Laenec thought that it was improper to examine the chest of his young female patient that way, so he rolled up a newspaper to make a long tube. He was surprised to hear that the sounds were actually louder when listened to the sound that way, and the rest, as they say, is history. 
Many historians have given much credit to the invention of the stethoscope, when it comes to the advancement of western medicine. Not only does it provide information about the condition of various systems in the body, the process is also painless and simple, which was a novelty during the earlier days. The modern version of the stethoscope is an invention of Dr. David Littmann, whose name is made immortal in the famous stethoscope brand that millions of medical professionals proudly sling around their necks. 

There are also devices called Doppler scanners, which can diagnose a condition by the intensity, frequency and the quality of the waves emitted by the body organs

Looking at the parts of a stethoscope, a typical chest piece comprises two sides, called the bell; which is used to hear low pitched sounds, and the diaphragm; which transmits high pitch sounds. These are connected to the ear pieces through a rubber tube. 
A stethoscope has multiple functions. But mostly, it is used to distinguish normal sounds from abnormal sounds and to collect information on the various systems of the body through the clues that the body supplies in the form of sounds. If you listen carefully, you will come to realize that an added sound-called a murmur- between the Lubs and Dubs of the heart, a bubbly sound at the base of the lungs or the absence of sounds in the belly area, coupled with a history and other examination findings, tell a stories of their own. But in order to read the story through these clues, much skill; gained through practice, as well as discipline, is required. As any senior doctor would tell you, in order to immediately recognize an abnormal sound of the heart you have to listen to a hundred normal hearts and gain the practice beforehand. 
Today, there are different stethoscopes used by different specialties. Paediatricians have their own miniature version of stethoscope, while the cardiologists have devices with a larger chest piece, which carries sounds better. 
As with many other devices of use, the stethoscope has kept up with the advancements of the technology as well. Today we have stethescopes which perform a variety of functions like digitally enhancing the sounds, reducing background noise and recording the sounds that are heard through a computer. There are also devices called Doppler scanners, which can diagnose a condition by the intensity, frequency and the quality of the waves emitted by the body organs. Many western doctors predict that traditional stethoscope would soon be replaced with these superior hand held scanners, which will relieve much of the workload of a doctor. But can this symbol of modern medicine which was the companion of physicians for generations, truly be replaced by a robotic device Only time will tell for sure.

JAT Holdings announces unique initiative to rejuvenate Temple Art
	
JAT Holdings has created a unique initiative to breathe new life into discarded temple flowers. Beginning April 2018, JAT Holdings will begin production of Petal Paint  paints made from the pigment of discarded temple flowers, to be used in the restoration of sacred Temple murals.
Petal Paint is an initiative that pays homage to Sri Lankas rich heritage of Temple art, often found in the form of captivating wall murals in Temple Shrine Rooms.
The Petal Paint concept is being turned into reality by the R&D team at JAT Holdings, who will extract the vibrant, natural colors from the dry flowers and turn them into unique paints. Initially Petal Paint will be created in the three most widely used colors in Temple art  red, blue and yellow. Lotus Red, Pigeonwing Blue and Trumpet Yellow paints will thereafter be used in projects to restore and breathe new life into fading Temple murals.
The ancient art of extracting color from a natural source like a flower is now being coupled with modern pigment extraction technology to create a one-of-a-kind paint, says Richard Gunawardene - Head of Marketing at JAT Holdings. The combined efforts of ancient knowledge and modern technology will come together to create Petal Paint, which will be used to restore one of the most beautiful art inheritances of the Sri Lankan people  the Temple murals found across our country.
The process of the Petal Paint extraction is done with maximum efficiency levels using modern hi-tech equipment. The flower offerings will be collected from various Temples across Colombo, Sri Lanka and taken through a drying process, after which their natural pigments will be extracted to create Petal Paint.

Macron calls US  policy insane
	

Emmanuel Macron taking a parting shot at Donald Trump and said it is insane the US is pulling out of international treaties while predicting the President would kill the Iran deal. 
The French leader said Trump would get out of the nuclear agreement next month for domestic reasons and accused the US of short-termism by withdrawing from treaties it had only just joined. 
His comments on Wednesday come towards the end of a three-day state visit which saw Macron and Trump lavish each other with compliments and heap praise the warm relationship between their two countries. 
My view  I dont know what your president will decide  is that he will get rid of this deal on his own, for domestic reasons, Macron told around a dozen reporters at George Washington University. 
When pressed again on whether Trump would ditch the deal, Macron replied: I think so. Thats my view. I dont have any specific information, Im not an insider. My view is that there is a big risk he will leave. 
And on Trumps tendency to pull out of international treaties, the French leader said: It can work in the short term but its very insane in the medium to long term, he said of the US decision to change [its] opposition so often. 
Trump - a fierce opponent of the July 2015 agreement signed by Tehran and international powers - must declare by May 12 if he will walk away from the existing deal .

Minister vows action after Yala bear saga
	
While stating that there is a threat to wildlife in the Yala National Park due to the action of some people, Wildlife Minister Ravindra Samaraweera yesterday said steps would be taken to minimize such threats which would result in decreasing safari jeeps entering the park daily.
Minister Samaraweera made this statement after a photograph, which showed a number of safari jeeps with tourists surrounding a sloth bear in the park, went viral on social media. 
He told the Daily Mirror that this was an issue which should be taken into consideration and accordingly immediate steps would be taken with this regard by the ministry in order to safeguard the wildlife.
People who are visiting Yala tend to engage in such activities and when they see an animal, all the safari jeeps surround it in order to have a closer look. The steps taken to control this condition would be informed in the near future and it might result in reducing the number of safari jeeps entering the park daily, he said.
However, Wildlife Conservation Department said such incidents could be dangerous to wildlife if some sort of accident took place.
Departments Director General M.G.C. Sooriyabandara told the Daily Mirror that the wildlife in these tourists zones including Yala were habituated to humans and their activities and added that it was the reason this bear in the picture was walking among the safari jeeps calmly without any fear.
Meanwhile, senior environmental Jagath Gunawardena told the Daily Mirror that this incident was a result of irregular vehicle moments.
He said the wildlife should not be distressed due to safari jeeps and added that Wildlife Conservation Department should tackle these issues.
I have observed that many animals were being run over and killed on the roads in Yala. Accordingly, this incident is obviously a threat to wildlife, he said. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

Niece is good riddance for politically- influential uncles
	

The lady in this story had the good fortune to be appointed to a high office in provincial administration.

On the day she assumed duties in the high office, two of her politically powerful paternal uncles stood on either side of her to invoke their blessings.
However, when she assumed duties in another station following an unusual transfer, only her third uncle living in a distant place had turned up to offer his greetings.
The two politically-influential uncles whose goodwill she enjoyed earlier have now fallen out with her and are shunning her like the plague, they say.
Ever since assuming the high office, the lady is said to have become highly critical of one of the two uncles holding other political positions. The bad blood between the uncle and the niece that later aggravated into a feud manifested in even their official functions, is the main cause for her transfer to another area, they say.

Occupational safety and sincere work
	
In the aftermath of the Horana tragedy where five people were killed allegedly due to negligence in the maintenance of ammonia and other gas tanks at a private rubber factory where export quality shoes are manufactured, the United Nations and its member countries tomorrow mark the World Day for Safety and Health at Work. 
It also comes three days before the traditional May Day or labour day, though in Sri Lanka this year the main May Day rallies will be held on Monday May 7 in view of the Vesak week which began yesterday. 
This years theme is, occupational safety health vulnerability of young workers. In a statement the UN says this year, the World Day for Safety and Health at Work and the World Day Against Child Labour are coming together in a joint campaign to improve the safety and health of young workers and end child labour. The campaign aims to accelerate action to achieve Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) target 8.8 of safe and secure working environments for workers by 2030 and SDG target 8.7 of ending child labour by 2025. 
About 541 million young workers- in the age group of 15 to 24 and including 37 million children in hazardous child labour - account for more than 15 per cent of the worlds labour force and suffer up to a 40 per cent higher rate of non-fatal occupational injuries than adult workers older than 25, the UN says. 
The World Day for Safety and Health at Work is an annual international campaign to promote safe, healthy and decent work. It is held on April 28 and has been observed by the International Labour Organization (ILO) since 2003. 
A national occupational safety and health culture is one in which the right to a safe and healthy working environment is respected at all levels, where governments, employers and workers actively participate in securing a safe and healthy working environment through a system of defined rights, responsibilities and duties, and where the highest priority is accorded to the principle of prevention, according to the UN. 
The annual World Day for Safety and Health at Work on April 28 promotes the prevention of occupational accidents and diseases globally. It is an awareness-raising campaign intended to focus international attention on the magnitude of the problem and on how promoting and creating a safety and health culture can help reduce the number of work-related deaths and injuries. 
Each of us is responsible for stopping deaths and injuries on the job. As governments we are responsible for providing the infrastructure  laws and services  necessary to ensure that workers remain employable and that enterprises flourish; this includes the development of a national policy and programme and a system of inspection to enforce compliance with occupational safety and health legislation and policy. As employers we are responsible for ensuring that the working environment is safe and healthy. As workers we are responsible to work safely and to protect ourselves and not to endanger others, to know our rights and to participate in the implementation of preventive measures, the UN adds.
 
In Sri Lanka, besides the Horana tragedy, there were three other major incidents of occupational hazards at factories in Dambulla and Ja-ela in March. Two deaths occurred in the Dambulla tragedy showing the need for the government, the employees and the employers to work together in strengthening occupational safety at work places specially for young people. 
Hard work is essential for the welfare of ourselves and our country. We need to work in a spirit of honesty and integrity and also work with sincerity and in a sacrificial spirit. Such workers need to be rewarded and as the poet Longfellow said, when we have work to do we need to do it with a will for those who wish to reach the top must first climb the hill.

Prez orders fence along Viyana Canal
	
Following the instructions made by President Maithripala Sirisena, the Mahaweli Authority today said that it had taken measures to install a fence along the Viyana Canal at a cost of Rs.26.5 million.
Mahaweli Authoritys Director General Sarath Chandrasiri Vithana said the estimation for the project was approved at a meeting held this morning. 
The decision to install a fence was made after several vehicles toppled into the Canal. The most recent incident being an SUV found floating in the Canal yesterday.
The 13 km long Nikathupitiya-Mapakadawewa Road adjacent to the Viyana Canal was earlier used as a service route by the Mahaweli Authority.
Later, five kilometres of the road was acquired by the Road Development Authority (RDA) and developed as a B Class Road.
An RDA official said they produced a Road Safety Audit Report to the Mahaweli Authority in order to take precautions and minimise accidents, following a survey conducted on the instruction of RDA Provincial Director.
Earlier last month, the RDA had also sought approval for Rs. 62 million to install crash barriers in the identified risk zones along the canal.
According to the Road Safety Audit Report, a proposal had also been made to impose speed limits and set up lamp posts along the road to minimise accidents. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Right of Reply Amrit Muttukumaru responds to Outsider
	
Outsider has also become an apologist for CBSL Governor Dr. Indrajit Coomaraswamy
My Rotary membership was unlawfully terminated twice after I blew the whistle on RI wrongdoing
It is disappointing that the legal system is abused to thwart expos of wrongdoing
I re-iterate - RW must initiate transparent measures to bring Arjuna Mahendran to Sri Lanka to face due process for his role in the allegedBond Scam
Although on principle I do not respond to cowards afraid to place their names upfront, I am making an exception in this instance to expose those squirming with my public interest undertakings particularly naming & shaming. I have done so with responsibility to which wrongdoers have no credible answer other than unleash mercenaries in different forms for different rewards. This will notdeter me.

My article in the Dailymirror  UNP Politburo set up for internecine war between Sajith, Navin has sent Outsider evidently a rabid acolyte of PM Wickremesinghe who views the world with dark glasses into panic mode.
I am no apologist for anyone. In my said article I inter alia stated:
The Yahapalana Government has only itself to blame for keeping the door wide open to give the Rajapaksas another shot at leading this country
I have also referred to the traumatic Rajapaksa led years
I ask Outsider why is RW not holding those concerned accountable
Outsider trivializes my call for real reforms in the UNP by the puerile question  Does Mr. Muthukumaru expect the farmer and fisherman to come to Sirikotha and offer advice 
Outsider refers to a plethora of alleged egregious wrongdoing under the Rajapaksa presidency which include when Nivard Cabraal was CBSL Governor. I again ask why is RW pussyfooting on these allegations What is he afraid of
Governor Indrajit
Outsider has also become an apologist for CBSL Governor Dr. Indrajit Coomaraswamy.

I re-iterate that Governor Indrajit has an obligation to carry out a transparent investigation into alleged instances of blatant tax evasion and money laundering identified by the Presidential Commission of Inquiry probing the issuance of Treasury Bonds. This is particularly so in the context of the European Union designating Sri Lanka as a high risk country for money laundering subsequent to the Financial Action Task Force placing the country on its grey list reportedly from November 2017. Governor Indrajit who assumed office as CBSL Governor from 3 July 2016 must bear some responsibility. This designation is serious. Under the circumstances, which ETHICAL entity will want to investin Sri Lanka
In the context of Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs) being at the centre of the worldwide efforts for the prevention of money laundering, the CBSLs stance is untenable. Outsider refers to my views on PEPs as a witch-hunt! While in no way suggesting that the mere listing of names and entities in tax havens is indicative of wrongdoing, it is disappointing that Governor Indrajit has completely ignored my e-mails commencing 30 August 2017 on determining the legitimacy or otherwise of the offshore accounts allegedly held by Sri Lankan citizens in tax havens revealed almost two years ago in the Panama Papers. In this connection particular reference was made to the offshore account allegedly held by the Chairman of a leading private sector bank linked to a company in which Governor Indrajit was a director until almost the day he was appointedCBSL Governor. 
Outsider refers to a plethora of alleged egregious wrongdoing under the Rajapaksa presidency which include when Nivard Cabraal was CBSL Governor. I again ask why is RW pussyfooting on these allegations What is he afraid of
Canard
Outsider has gone ballistic after my demand that RW must Publicly apologize to the 6.2 million voters who were duped by reneging on the promises given in the run-up to the 8 January 2015 presidential elections by stating:
1) Mr. Muthukumaru is used to apologising in court!
2) Mr. Muthukumaru is no stranger to courts
These canards need to be nailed once and for all.
In the context of Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs) being at the centre of the worldwide efforts for the prevention of money laundering, the CBSLs stance is untenable. Outsider refers to my views on PEPs as a witch-hunt
After I questioned the integrity of Rotary International (RI) one of the largest NGOs in the world which solicits and receives huge donations on the back of purporting to be an ethical entity which include the unsuitability of two persons from Sri Lanka to hold high RI office, they both sued me for Rs. 100 Million each alleging defamation. They both initiated a settlement on IDENTICAL undertakings which prohibits all parties including me from writing on issues concerning each other. Does this not demonstrate the UTTER FALSITY of the alleged defamation I agreed to the Settlement due to time andcost constraints. 
My Rotary membership was unlawfully terminated twice after I blew the whistle on RI wrongdoing. Notwithstanding my expos both these persons went on to hold high RI office. One of these persons was even appointed special ambassador to attract foreign investment by RW. I do not wish to speculate on how much of FDIs came in dueto his efforts!
The questionable integrity of RI include accountability for the US $10 Million Schools Re-awaken project with donor funds to rebuild/rehabilitate 25 Tsunami devastated schools. Subsequent to some of my public interest undertakings one of these persons alleged a breach of my part of the undertaking and reported me for Contempt of Court. In order to avoid the administrative inconvenience involved and for the purpose of settlement I did apologize for the alleged Contempt of Court. It has nothing to do with any defamation which Outsider has mischievously insinuated. I am only stating these facts for the sole purpose of setting the record straight. It is disappointing that the legal system is abused to thwart expos of wrongdoing. 
I re-iterate - RW must initiate transparent measures to bring Arjuna Mahendran to Sri Lanka to face due process for his role in the alleged Bond Scam which will include communicating with Singapore PM Lee Hsien Loong. RW has a moral obligation to do so since he has consistently defended him no matter what at every turn.

Sampanthans Dilemma
	
Is Sampanthan playing into the hands of JO
JO aims at Opposition Leader post, the General Secretary posts of United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP)
Attempting to get hold of the General Secretary posts of the UPFA and the SLFP using as pawns the 16 SLFP MPs
NCM against Sampanthan put on hold at the instance of the former President
JO argued that they be given the Opposition Leader post claiming that they were the largest group in the Opposition
Local Government election results point to the fact that the UNPs calculations have gone wrong

The Joint Opposition, the Mahinda Rajapaksa loyalists in the Parliament, seems to aim currently at three main positions in and outside of the Parliament.
One is the Opposition Leader post, a position that they have been eying from the day this Parliament met for the first time after the last General Elections and the others being the General Secretary posts of two parties led by President Maithripala Sirisena - the United peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) and its main constituent party, the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP).
Once the three positions are captured, the mission is accomplished they seem to think as it would be a leap forward in their campaign to office.
They are attempting to get hold of the General Secretary posts of the UPFA and the SLFP using as pawns the 16 SLFP MPs, who had resigned from their Ministerial posts and the Deputy Speaker post after voting in favour of the No-Confidence Motion against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
Interestingly, among this group of 16 there are those two former General Secretaries of the SLFP and the UPFA, Anura Priyadharshana Yapa and Susil Premajayantha, who were unceremoniously sacked from those posts by President Sirisena on the eve of the last General Elections for helping his main rival, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa under his nose.
If any two persons of the group recaptured the two positions it would really be a sweet revenge especially for the duo.
The Joint Opposition had been challenging to bring in another NCM against Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan for voting against the NCM against the Premier and it is said to have put on hold at the instance of the former President.
Meanwhile, the backbenchers of the United National Party (UNP) were also to bring in separate no-faith motions against the group of 16 for voting in favour of the one against the PM but they too were withheld on the instructions of Premier Ranil Wickremesinghe.
The purported reason for the proposed NCM against the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) leader Sampanthan was just a ruse, as the Joint Opposition have been laying claim to the Opposition Leader post occasionally from the very beginning. And the stand of the UNP towards this demand has been strange as they have rejected it while recognising the Joint Opposition as a separate group in the Parliament.
However, Sampanthan seems to have forgotten his duty towards all the communities in the country as the Opposition Leader. His current attitude justifies the Joint Oppositions demand for the Opposition Leader post
Hard on the heels of the last General Elections, Mahinda Rajapaksa and 54 of his loyalists who contested under the UPFA led by President Sirisena requested the Speaker of the Parliament to make arrangements for them to sit in the Opposition benches and recognise them as a separate group in the House.
They also argued that they should be given the Opposition Leader post claiming that they were the largest group in the Opposition of the House.
Mahinda Rajapaksa recommended former Transport Minister of his government Kumara Welgama for the post and all 55 members of the Joint Opposition made it a request in a letter to the Speaker Karu Jayasuriya.
It was rejected by the Speaker as well as the UNP on the grounds that no party called Joint Opposition had contested at the General Elections and no party had returned to Parliament under the name of Joint Opposition, despite their request to sit in the Opposition being acceded.
Accordingly, leader of the TNA Sampanthan was recognised as the Leader of the largest party in the Opposition of the House and was appointed the Opposition Leader on September 3, 2015, by the Speaker.
JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake was appointed the Opposition Whip.
Legally the contention was correct.

JO request rejected on the grounds that no party called Joint Opposition contested and no party had returned to Parliament under the name of Joint Opposition

The UNP (106 seats), UPFA (95 seats), Ilankai Thamil Arasu Katchi under which the TNA contested (16 seats), Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) (6 seats), Eelam Peoples Democratic Party (EPDP) (1 seat) and Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC) (1 seat) were the parties that had returned to the Parliament.
Therefore no other party or group can legally be recognised as a party or group representing Parliament Opposition.
However, there has been precedence, where parties which contested under a coalition, with other parties had later been recognised as a separate group in the House.
The JVP which contested under the UPFA symbol at the 2004 General Elections had been recognised as a separate group until 2010, after they severed links with the UPFA in June 2005.
Yet, the Speaker dismissed the Joint Oppositions demand to be treated as a separate group.
A few weeks later the Joint Oppositions demand for the recognition as a separate group reemerged-this time sans the demand for the Opposition leader post.
And this time the UNP was amenable apparently with a view to strengthen the Mahinda Rajapaksa group within the SLFP, which according to the calculations of the UNP leadership, would divide the SLFP and help the UNP at the forthcoming elections.
It was on the same grounds that the UNP might have been soft on the high profile corruption charges against the leaders of the former regime.
However, the recent Local Government election results point to the fact that the UNPs calculations have gone wrong.
The SLFP has not been divided right in the middle. Instead, at the grassroots level, the entire party has been with Rajapaksas from the beginning.
Again in April 2016, the Joint Opposition had some issues over the Opposition Leader post.
Mahajana Eksath Peramuna (MEP) leader Dinesh Gunawardane criticised Sampanthan for speaking only about problems faced by the Tamil people ignoring national issues.
Sampanthan, in response, had lashed out at the MEP leader and questioned as to whether southern politicians had taken up issues that affected Tamil people in their engagements with the government or the people.
They are concerned about the issues around them and we too are concerned about the issues around us, he had told the media.
As a Tamil leader, Sampanthans argument was sound but he seems to have forgotten that he was the Opposition Leader representing the whole country.

His complaint that the Sinhalese leaders were indifferent to the problems faced by the Tamil people and leave them to the Tamil leaders is undeniable.
Southern political leaders, irrespective of them even being ministers, view as alien to them the issues that affect Tamils such as resettlement of people displaced by the war, occupation of thousands of acres of lands belonging to the people by the security forces, detention of people for years even without a charge and disappearance of thousands of people during the war.
However, it does not in any way justify Sampanthans laxity in his duties as the Opposition Leader, since a strong Opposition is a must for a healthy democracy.
Many important national issues such as corruption, cost of living, the imposition of new taxes on the people and failure in the new electoral system had cropped up for the past three years which invites a broad public discourse.
The Opposition Leader cannot be indifferent to them.

One does not suggest the Opposition Leader oppose everything the Government does or proposes to do, as the tradition had been and the Joint Opposition expects.
He is at liberty to support the Government when he feels fit as in the case of the national budget.
However, he seems to have forgotten his duty towards all the communities in the country as the Opposition Leader.
Mr Sampanthans involvement in nationally important matters would help promote the much-needed reconciliation as well and the Tamil and Muslim people too might come out from the secluded insular mindset they have been pushed into by their leaders during the past several decades.
His current attitude justifies the Joint Oppositions demand for the Opposition Leader post.

SL improves ranking in Press Freedom Index-2018
	
Sri Lanka was ranked 131st in the World Press Freedom Index-2018, going up 10 notches from last year, the index compiled by the Reporters Without Borders or Reporters Sans Frontires (RSF) said.
According to the report which was released on Tuesday (24), Sri Lanka was in 131st place in terms of press freedom this year with a score of 41.37, this was out of a total of 180 countries.
In 2017, Sri Lanka was ranked 141 with a score of 44. 34. According to the report, the lesser the score, the higher the press freedom of a country.
In its country specific statement on Sri Lanka, the index questioned whether impunity will ever end in the country.
It said some progress has been made in the investigation into Lasantha Wickrematungas murder after the new government came into power, investigations into many other cases however have gone unpunished.
The government said journalists no longer had anything to fear because of their political views or their coverage of sensitive subjects such as corruption and human rights violations by the military. But attacks on journalist Freddy Gamage in June 2016 and in early 2018 fuelled the doubts in the minds of both the public and free media campaigners, it said.
It said the Tamil media, which are often the target of attacks and censorship, both during the civil war and after its official end in 2009, are still on their guard. It also said in March 2016, the ministry of parliamentary reform and mass media ordered all news websites to register with the government or become illegal.
This vague and disproportionate directive immediately reminded the media and citizen journalists of former President Mahinda Rajapaksas censorship methods, the statement said.
In the South Asian region, Bhutan, Nepal, Afghanistan and Maldives all performed better with rankings of 94, 106, 118 and 120 respectively. India was ranked 138, Pakistan 139 and Bangladesh 146.
Norway was ranked first in the index with the highest rate of press freedom in a country followed by Sweden, The Netherlands, Finland and Switzerland.
Meanwhile, North Korea was ranked bottom of the index with the worst press freedom in the world followed by Eritrea, Turkmenistan, Syria and China.
The 2018 World Press Freedom Index, reflects growing animosity towards journalists. Hostility towards the media, openly encouraged by political leaders, and the efforts of authoritarian regimes to export their vision of journalism, pose a threat to any democracy, the index report said.

SLFP May Day Rally: Large crowds expected in Batticaloa
	
The SLFP will hold the biggest-ever May Day rally at Chenkalady in Batticaloa on May 7 with the participation of the members of the joint opposition and the 16 SLFPers who quit the government recently, Senior Vice President and Minister, Nimal Siripala De Silva said today.
He said the SLFP May Day rally to be held in the Eastern Province would be the first step in uniting all factions of the party with dissenting views and a new beginning for the party.
The minister told a news conference that it was the SLFP which had the right to celebrate May Day because it was SLFP founder and former prime minister S.W.R.D. Bandaranaikes government, that declared May Day a public holiday.
That is why we hold this years May Day with added enthusiasm, as SLFP members of the JO and the rebel group of 16, have pledged to participate in the main rally at Batticaloa," he said.
The theme of the SLFPs May Day rally is, Promoting Reconciliation and Inter Communal Harmony.
In addition to the main rally at the Chenkalady sports ground in Batticaloa, the SLFP will hold a photo exhibition at the BMICH to commemorate party stalwarts like, T.B. Illangaratne, Alavi Moulana, Ananda Dassanayaka and Bharatha Premachandra.
The minister declined to answer questions related to politics and said he would answer all political questions at another forum, at another time, because this news briefing was only for the SLFP May Day rally.
However, there was a quick dialog between journalists and the minister.
Daily Mirror: How can you ensure the success of the SLFP May Day rally in the East when the party has disintegrated into three sections
Minister: Why are you talking only about the disintegration of the SLFP Hasn't the UNP and the JVP also fragmented Dont they have internal issues
Daily Mirror: Yes, there are issues within the UNP, but they dont fight outside the party. The SLFPs fighting and divisions are quite obvious.
Minister: Why are you attempting to create problems in the SLFP, and glad about fragmentation
Daily Mirror: No. What we want to see is unity and peace.
Minister: Ok, if that is the case, I am happy. I assure you that there will be a new journey by the SLFP after May 8. We are standing with our feet on both sides, with the aim of uniting all dissenting factions.
Daily Mirror: Will members of the rebel group of 16 participate in the May Day rally in Batticaloa
Minister: Yes. I am the chairman of the organizing committee. There are members of the rebel group like S.B. Dissanayaka, Sarath Ekanayaka and Dr. Sudharshini Fernandopulle serving in the organizing committee. They will all participate.
Journalist: Why are you celebrating May Day while the country is facing an economic crisis The rupee is depreciating daily and prices of all commodities have increased sharply.
Minister: Are there economic problems only in this country. Is it only Sri Lanka that holds May Day celebrations while having economic issues Dont be silly. May Day is a labour right and every worker has a right to celebrate it.
Journalist: Why are you having the SLFP May Day rally in Batticaloa.
Minister: There is nothing unusual about it. We have held May Day rallies in Galle, Kandy, Badulla and in Anuradhapura, in the recent past.
Journalist: As the Chairman of the organizing committee, are you confident of having a big crowd
Minister: You will see it on May 7. This will be the biggest ever rally in Sri Lankas history.
Journalist: Would you be bringing people in buses and trains from other parts of the country.
Minister: Who will not do it Does not the UNP and the JVP bring party supporters in buses for their rallies
Journalist: How many buses have been reserved so far
Minister De Silva: About 1,200 SLTB buses by yesterday. Four trains have also been reserved. The Sri Lanka Railways and the SLTB would release buses and trains only after they are paid their fares. There is no free transport in trains or SLTB buses to the rally. (Sandun A. Jayasekera)

Joanne Doornewaard  Ambassador of the Kingdom of the Netherlands to Sri Lanka and Maldives
On Wednesday, 25 April the Embassy of the Kingdom of Netherlands perfumed Trace Expert City with the scent of flowers, as it held a series of events to celebrate the floriculture industries of Sri Lanka and the Netherlands. The programme consisted of a floral arrangement competition, exhibition and a training workshop with floriculture experts from the Dutch agricultural vocational training institute Wellant College, in keeping with this years Kings Day theme of floriculture.
The programme was organized parallel to the Embassy of The Kingdom of the Netherlands National Day, Kings Day - the birthday of the King of the Netherlands, His Royal Highness Willem-Alexander van Oranje-Nassau. It was attended by H.E. Joanne Doornewaard, Ambassador of the Kingdom of the Netherlands to Sri Lanka and Maldives, consultants and expert florists from the Netherlands and Sri Lankan professionals from the floricultural industry.
The event commenced with a keynote address by Ambassador Doornewaard. The Netherlands is known for its expertise and innovation regarding horticulture and there is a lot of potential when it comes to collaborations between Sri Lanka and the Netherlands, said Ambassador Doornewaard. Events like this embody the motto of the strong partnership between the two countries: Sri Lanka  The Netherlands: Old Friends  New Trends.

30 participants took part in a floral arrangement competition during the morning session. This was facilitated by floral consultants from the Netherlands, who challenged competitors to create arrangements that melded Sri Lankan and Dutch style. Following this competition, a training workshop for 36 young professionals focused on improving professional capacities aligned with international standards. All participants received an official certificate of participation at the end of the programme.
Floriculture is characteristic of the Dutch economy, with the Netherlands leading the world market with a 50% share in global floricultural products. The industry has flourished for decades, specifically since the mid-1970s when the production and distribution of cut flowers burgeoned in the market. The countrys knowledgeand capacity in the industry makes it a viable partner to help Sri Lanka foster its own floricultural industry as a player in the global market.
Sri Lanka and the Netherlands are long termpartners in the economy, noted Ambassador Doornewaard. The Embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands facilitates multiple projects to transfer Dutch knowledge and technical knowhow in order to contribute to the growth of the Sri Lankan agricultural sector. This is one area where we see significant potential for growth and collaboration.

Trump admits  Cohen  represented him in Stormy Daniels deal
	

US, Daily Mail), 26 April, 2018 - President Trump admitted Thursday his personal attorney Michael Cohen represented him with this crazy Stormy Daniels deal but distanced himself from the lawyer who is now pleading the Fifth Amendment.
Trump spoke by phone Fox & Friends in an extraordinary half-hour appearance and said Cohen was one of his many attorneys, adding: He represents me like with this crazy Stormy Daniels deal.
From what I see, he did absolutely nothing wrong. There were no campaign funds going in. The telephone connection seemed to cut out for a few seconds after Trump mentioned Daniels.
The president has previously said he had no knowledge of the $130,000 payment Cohen made to porn actress Daniels in exchange for her silence just before the election about her claims of sex with Trump.
Trump told the Fox News morning show: This has nothing to do with me. Ive been told Im not involved.
Instead he claimed that Cohen - whom he called a good guy - was being investigated over his own business dealings.

Two Korean leaders meet for historic peace summit
	
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has crossed the line dividing the demilitarized zone to meet with South Korean President Moon Jae-in in what's being described as a historic summit, ABC News reported today.
Kim has made that first step, a great leap for the Korean Peninsula. The two posed for photos facing the North, then facing the South. Just about when Moon ushered Kim to walk toward the red carpet, Kim made a gesture offering Moon to take a step back across the demarcation line, to his side of the border. Whether pre-planned or not, the two smiled and took that step holding hands.
Escorted by traditional music, Moon and Kim walked together to the "Peace House," a three-story building where the official summit will take place.
Inside the "Peace House," Kim signed the guest book, writing in it for more than a minute. The two leaders then went into a reception room for a private conversation.
It's the first time since 2007 leaders of the two countries have met and is part of a recent thawing of relations as South Korea and the United States have focused on diplomacy in their efforts to dismantle North Korea's nuclear program.
The summit has been in the works for some time, with the stage being set by two previous meetings between high-level officials from the North and South, as well as the North's participation in the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, earlier this year. The two nations marched under one flag.

## Title: Understanding sexuality during youth

Understanding sexuality during youth
	


Sexuality is an important aspect of ones life through youth to ones death. Sexuality can be described as how a person experiences and expresses oneself as a sexual being. Two important concepts when talking about sexual health are gender identity and sexual orientation. Gender identity refers to ones own perception of being a male or a female despite his/her biologically determined (based on genes) sex; usually biological male identifies himself as a man and vice versa. 

However some individuals might be uncomfortable in identifying with their biological sex, which can cause them extreme distress. Though the reasons for the latter discrepancy is not very well described, feeling uncomfortable in a situation with regard to a biologically assigned sex is beyond the control of the individual. They often feel that they are in the wrong body. These people may suffer from a condition known as gender dysphoria. 

Sexual orientation describes ones preference of sexual attraction. If it is towards the opposite sex, then they are referred to as heterosexuals and if it is towards the same sex, they are referred to as homosexuals. It is important to understand that homosexual practices are also normal and healthy sexual behaviours, and they should not be discriminated against. The brain of a homosexual is wired to be aroused by the same sex partner in the same way that a brain of a heterosexual is wired to be aroused by an opposite sex partner. Neither can change it on his will/ mind power! Therefore, one should not enter a marriage just to please the elders, if he or she is homosexually oriented. This will cause unnecessary trouble for both partners. 
Due to the immense development of human brain during evolution, and social changes, which took place in parallel, human sexuality is different to that of animals in many ways. Sexual feelings and acts are subjected to intense control of our brains, and if the circumstances are not appropriate, these feelings are suppressed. This is one such difference from animal sexual behaviour. 

On reaching adolescence, one starts to experience sexual feelings, which depend on increasing levels of sexual hormones in the blood. It is normal to have these feelings, and it is not something to feel guilty about or be embarrassed. 

Having sex is an act which gives humans great pleasure. As far as the development of the brain is concerned, it is developing until the age of 23-24 and the last parts to develop are those which are responsible to delay impulsive acts. In other words the brain during ones late teens and early twenties is like a vehicle without breaks! Therefore, before giving into urges (having urges is completely normal) one should think whether he/she is ready for the consequences of having sex; pregnancy, acquiring sexually transmitted diseases. Using a condom in a proper way, will help avoid both.

The brain of a homosexual is wired to be aroused by the same sex partner in the same way that a brain of a heterosexual is wired to be aroused by an opposite sex partner


No one can force one to have sex saying things like the relationship will be over if it does not happen. Similarly, photographing or filming the partner when naked or the act of having sex should never be done. This is because one can use these explicit material to blackmail the other. No one should be allowed to touch ones body without his/ her consent. 

Myths about sex

1.  Masturbation weakens ones body 
Masturbation is a natural sexual behaviour which is practised by both men and women. If someone engages in masturbation it is an indication of his/ her mental and sexual well-being, but not engaging in masturbation itself is not indicative of an illness. 

2. The first sexual encounter is painful for a woman 
This is a widely prevalent myth about sex which makes young women apprehensive of the first sexual encounter. The first sexual encounter is not painful and if a woman is extremely frightened of having sex, she may be having a condition called vaginism, which is a treatable mental illness. 

3. A woman bleeds during the first sexual intercourse 
The above myth was widely prevalent in Sri Lanka a few decades ago, and many youth do not believe this now. But there is a minority who still look for blood stains after having sex with their partner. If and when bleeding happens, it is due to breaking of the hymen, which is a tiny membrane in the vagina. In some women this can be absent or it may have torn during sports or it may not break during intercourse. People who believe in this myth-that if she does not bleed during the first intercourse -consider the woman as having bad character and insult her, often for rest of her life. If this is analysed further, the question which invariably should be asked is if there is anything called good character defined by whether someone had sex before marriage or not, isnt the same notion applicable for men as well 


For a healthy sex life....
Having sex is not only for child bearing. This is another difference with regard to sexuality of humans when compared with animals. According to Oxford Textbook of Psychiatry human sexuality is more about fertilizing relationships than eggs!. Deriving sexual pleasure has become the major need of sexual intercourse/ sexual act. In the modern social context it is advisable that the woman should not get pregnant just after getting married. It is always healthier to have some time to get used to new challenges of married life before thinking of pregnancy. 

Over the past few decades there has been a huge transformation in social circumstances and technology. These changes have affected feelings and thoughts of the modern men and women equally. Sexuality of humans is greatly affected by such changes. The impact can be both positive and negative depending on how the couple adjust to these changes. Five senses play a major role in human sexual behaviour. The stimuli one receives through eyes, nose, ears, skin (touch) and tongue can either arouse or suppress ones sexual desire. Similarly, previous sexual experiences, beliefs and myths about sex can affect ones sexual arousal positively or negatively.


Abuse in substances like alcohol, cigarettes and cannabis also reduces sexual desire and it can lead to sexual impotence as well. In addition, pooly controlled physical illnesses like diabetes can lead to problems in ones sex life


At the beginning of a relationship it is common to face many challenges. It is essential to talk openly about ones sexual needs and desires/preferences with the sexual partner and explore what gives more pleasure to each other. It is equally important to respect the partners likes and dislikes and build up mutual understanding. These measures greatly improve the quality of sex life and keep boredom away, especially in long term relationships. It has been proven that couples who have good sexual relationships, also have satisfactory overall relationships. Like every other aspect of life, the quality of sex life will also improve with experience. 

The quality of ones sex life greatly affect ones general well-being as well. Sexual intercourse is one of natures way of giving ecstatic pleasure. Oxytocin, hormone widely known as love hormone is released in excessive amounts during sex and contribute towards pleasure experienced and also towards emotional bonding and trust between the couple. Furthermore, during sex the part of the nervous system which helps humans to relax, the parasympathetic nervous system, are fully activated. This aids good cardiovascular health. 

Women need more time to reach reasonable sexual stimulation. Therefore, it is important that the couple engage in foreplay for an adequate time before intercourse. Attempting to penetrate before the woman is ready can be a painful experience to her as there would be no adequate lubrication in the vagina. 

Though, it is talked more about internal and external genitalia (ovaries and vulva in women and testicles and penis in men), when it comes to sex, it is not inaccurate to say that the brain is the main sexual organ in humans. Therefore, it is very important to have a clear mind to experience maximum sexual pleasure. Having sex while trying natural means of contraception or having sex fearing that others would know are very common, but easily rectifiable anxieties which can distant pleasure obtained from sex. 

Poor overall relationship between the couple, mental health problems and mental illnesses greatly affect the sexual well-being. The lack of rest reduces the desire for sex. Abuse of substances like alcohol, cigarettes and cannabis also reduces sexual desire and it can lead to sexual impotence as well. In addition, poorly controlled physical illnesses like diabetes can lead to problems in ones sex life. 

It is imperative that one should meet a psychiatrist, rather than obtain information from the uninformed or the internet, or believing in myths, when encountered with a problem in sex life.

## Title: Vaccinate every child! Immunization saves lives

Vaccinate every child! Immunization saves lives
	
Immunization is the most efficient public health intervention in reducing the burden of infectious diseases. A person is made immune or resistant to an infectious disease thereby stimulating the bodys own immune system to safeguard the individual from subsequent diseases or infections. This process which is usually done in the form of a vaccine, administered to the body has been able to ward-off at least 2-3 million deaths each year in the world. As a result this process has been protecting children from various deadly infectious diseases like Diphtheria, Tetanus, Polio, Measles etc. over years. 
According to World Health Organization (WHO), immunization is considered to be one of the most cost-effective and easily accessible mode of health strategies and is described as an investment made on health of our future generations. This is said not only due to its efficiency, but the capacity to cater precisely to identified target groups. 
In an attempt to bring the history of immunization in Sri Lanka, National Immunization Schedule and immunization services available under the spotlight, we are having this discussion with Dr. Deepa Gamage, Consultant Epidemiologist from the Epidemiology Unit, Ministry of Health. 

Importance of vaccination
Most medicines or drugs are given to cure an illness or to relieve its symptoms. Vaccines are different and they are administered to prevent illnesses or a disease occurring agent. Vaccination in the process of immunization, to develop immunity in the body, helps children to stay healthy, which leads to a healthy nation in future. In fact vaccination ensures healthy lives and promotes well-being explains Dr. Gamage. 
She further mentioned that, the health, safety and well-being of children are of primary concern in protecting children and creating a healthy nation in future. Goal 3 of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) targets the ensuring of healthy lives and promotes well-being for everybody by 2030. We expect to end preventable deaths of newborns and children under 5 years of age. All countries aim at reducing neonatal mortality to at least as low as 12 per 1000 live births and under-5 year child mortality to at least as low as 25 per 1000 live births. In achieving these targets and creating a healthy nation, vaccination plays an important role in preventing preventable deaths in children, the doctor said. 

History of vaccination
The vaccination process dates far back to more than 200 years ago where country physician Dr. Edward Jenner observed an induced protection for Small Pox. He had done experiments on inoculating Vaccinia Virus (cowpox) to a young boy which helped him protect himself against Smallpox. In the year 1798, Dr. Edward Jenner first demonstrated the vaccination which offered protection against Smallpox. As a result, over the 18th and 19th centuries, the Smallpox vaccine was implemented successfully on a global scale and the medical authorities succeeded in eradicating Smallpox by the year 1977 says Dr. Gamage. 
Elaborating more on the scenario, she mentioned that the introduction of routine immunization has generally reduced the incidence of several vaccine preventable diseases through the past few decades. Similar success in disease reduction has been demonstrated by immunization programmes in many other countries. 
The World Health Organizations (WHO) Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI), with assistance from the United Nations Childrens Fund (UNICEF) and other donors such as Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI), has made great strides in extending these benefits to developing countries. Immunizations permitted the global eradication of smallpox, and may do the same for Poliomyelitis, Neonatal tetanus, Diphtheria, Measles and some other vaccine preventable diseases. 
According to her, natural immunity occurs when a child is exposed to a disease and becomes infected, but the risks of death and long-term disabilities are much greater with natural infections. Immunization can prevent infectious diseases that could kill, harm or expose children to long-term disabilities. Without vaccines, children are at risk of becoming seriously ill, suffering from disability and even death from diseases like polio, measles, diphtheria, tetanus and whooping cough. Immunizing a child not only protects that particular child, but also other children and adults by increasing the level of immunity in the general population and minimizing the spread of infection in the community (herd protection). 

History of Immunization in Sri Lanka
The history of immunization in Sri Lanka date back to the 19th century. The law relating to compulsory vaccination (against smallpox) is referred to in the Vaccination Ordinance of 1886. 
The Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) established in 1978, has continued to make excellent progress over the past two decades, most notably in terms of achieving high immunization coverage and disease control. Important milestones of immunization in Sri Lanka are given below.

Sri Lanka has tremendous achievements in the National Immunization Programme in maintaining very high vaccination coverage in all districts during past 2 decades resulted in very low numbers in vaccine preventable diseases. The last Smallpox case in Sri Lanka was in 1972, Diphtheria case in 1991, Neonatal tetanus case in 2009 and Poliomyelitis case in 1993. Congenital Rubella Syndrome, Rubella and Measles are currently at a near elimination stage. And Whooping cough and other vaccine preventable diseases are maintaining at a very low status while maintaining satisfactory communicable disease notifications and surveillance in the country. In fact, it is very important to vaccinate all the children and every child born to prevent these deadly infectious diseases as it can rise its heads at any time if not properly immunize children says Dr. Gamage. 
She further mentioned that in the context of high international travel and tourism there are high chances of importation of diseases and transmission of communicable diseases making exposure to these deadly diseases. Raising a childs immunity with proper vaccination at the correct age at the correct time is important, not only to protect that particular child, but to prevent community transmission and protect other children and adults in the community too. The National Immunization Policy has addressed this issue of vaccinating a child as a right of the child and also a right of the others in protecting others.
National Immunization Programme is implemented by the Epidemiology Unit, Ministry of Health through maternal and child health (MCH) clinics, conducted by the field level staff of Medical Officer of Health (MOH) and through immunization clinics in all major hospitals. Medical Officers of Health, Public Health Nursing Sisters, Public Health Midwives and Public Health Inspectors are working as a team in immunizing all the children in their respective geographic areas. The National Centre of the Immunization Programme, Epidemiology Unit is responsible and ensures to get down quality vaccines which are WHO pre-qualified, registered vaccines which are maintained at proper temperature from the manufacture until administration to the child. All vaccine storing centres are equipped with standard special vaccine storing refrigerators (Ice Lined Refrigerators) and proper monitoring of the cold chain maintenance are done with standard newer temperature monitoring equipment (Fridge tags, log tags and Freeze tags) explains Dr. Gamage. 
Elucidating that these standards are regularly monitored by the district level Regional Epidemiologists and also by the national level authorities she says that the efforts are done to ensure maintaining the quality and potency of vaccines for adequate immune development on vaccination in each child. All children are screened by a medical doctor for the eligibility of the vaccination and they are ready with emergency kits and plan for early attention if there is any possible adverse event. In comparison to some developing countries, Sri Lanka provides equal access to quality immunization services for all children in an equitable manner, ensuring high standards, she said.
World Health Organization has declared an Immunization week from April 24-30 to mark the World Immunization Week (WIW). The main aim is to highlight the importance of collective action to provide immunization and make everybody have access to such medication. This is done to ensure the protection of every person from vaccine-preventable diseases through the National Immunization Programme.

Where goes Korea after the crucial talks
	

When Donald Trump after his 2016 election victory met President Barack Obama in the White House, the outgoing President in a parting advice to Trump said: North Korea should be a foreign policy priority.
Obama tried to work out a summit meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un but due to opposition from the conservatives, both in his Democratic Party and the opposition Republican Party, he had to abandon his plans. Maybe it was too much for Obama, for he had spent much of his bargaining power on normalising ties with Cuba  a demanding task just as tough as normalising ties with North Korea. In 2015, Obama not only established diplomatic ties with Cuba after 54 years, but also visited Cuba and sat together with Cuban President Raul Castro to watch a baseball match between the Cuba national team and an American Major League team. Obamas diplomatic triumph was a shocker and belatedly justified the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to him.
But now Trump, who has often scoffed at Obama for his failure to deal effectively with North Korea, has pulled out a similar shocker. If nothing untoward happens, Trump will meet North Koreas leader Kim Jong-un by the end of next month or early June at a place yet to be named. The two leaders together with South Koreas President Moon Jae-in could even share this years Nobel peace prize.
Certainly, much of the credit should go to President Moon Jae-in, a liberal politician, who dreams of Korean unification. Moon was a supporter of the Sunshine Policy former South Korean President Kim Dae-jung formulated to unite the two Koreas and improve the combined economy. With Trump-Kim rhetoric taking the world to the brink of nuclear war in August last year, Moon feared for the safety of millions of South Koreans. The Winter Olympics in February helped him revive the Sunshine Policy. He urged North Korea to send a strong athletics delegation to the Games.
North Korea did respond favourably, sending not only a powerful athletics team which took part under the banner of unified Korea in some events, but also sent Kim Yo-Jong, the elegant sister of Kim Jong-un to the Games village in Pyeongchang. In official events connected with the Games, Kim Yo-Jong was seen in the presence of US Vice President Mike Pence. Moon meets Kim today at a border village.
Whether or not Trump succeeds in persuading Kim Jong-un to dismantle North Koreas nuclear programme, the ice has been broken. It was only in August last year that a nuclear war between them seemed a possibility. This was after North Korea test-fired a series of long-range missiles that could hit any part of the United States and reports appeared in the US media that North Korea had successfully developed miniature nuclear warheads that could be fitted into the missiles.
Reacting to the developments, Trump issued a doomsday warning in a twitter message: North Korea best not make any more threats to the United States. They will be met with fire, fury and, frankly, power, the likes of which this world has never seen before.
In response, North Korea said it would send a salvo of four missiles over Japan and towards the US territory of Guam and mocked Trump as a man bereft of reason.
In October last year, Trump in another tweet mockingly called Kim Jong-un A little Rocket Man. But on Tuesday, Trump hailed the North Korean leader as a very honourable man. The change probably underscores the maxim that in politics, there are no permanent friends or foes, but only permanent interests.
Permanent interests apart, the turn of events also goes well with Trumps re-election campaign. On the one hand, the North Korea turnaround  Chinese media reports say North Korea suspended nuclear tests due to the collapse of its testing site -- has given Trump a magicians wand to divert the American peoples attention away from the Russia probe and bad publicity over his alleged affairs with porn stars and playmates. On the other, he emerges strong as a President who has tamed North Korea, a President who does what others cannot do. He apparently knows how to keep his vote bank intact.
Trump hailed the North Korean leader as a very honourable man. The change probably underscores the maxim that in politics, there are no permanent friends or foes, but only permanent interests
Given Trumps style of crisis management, one can safely assume that he has got an assurance of sorts from Kim Jong-un during the secret meeting between the North Korean leader and Trumps envoy Mike Pompeo, the secretary of State-designate, earlier this month. In a concession to the US, North Korea has indicated that it will not ask for the withdrawal of US troops from South Korea.
Now this raises serious geopolitical issues. If the Moon-Kim and Trump-Kim talks lead to a peace treaty between the two Koreas and eventually unification, it will be a big victory for Washingtons China containment policy.
But China is unlikely to let go of North Korea to the US camp, without a fight. For China, North Korea is a vital part of its geostrategic plan. Apart from Russia, North Korea is Chinas only ally in the East Asian region where China feels it has been surrounded by US military bases. From Chinas point of view, a unified Korea should, at best, be pro-China and, at worst, be neutral. It is nave to assume that the North Korean leader was acting without informing China first. What else would he have discussed with Chinas President Xi Jinping after he made a secret train journey to Beijing in March other than the geopolitics of the upcoming meetings with Moon and Trump
What is at stake at Kims meetings with Moon and Trump is the issue of North Koreas nuclear weapons and missiles. Severely affected by international sanctions, North Korea is struggling to maintain a multibillion dollar nuclear programme and look into the basic needs of its 25 million people at the same time. It badly needs an economic takeoff. It apparently feels the time is now.
But can North Korea agree to Trumps demand that it dismantle its nuclear arsenal Knowing well that nuclear weapons can deter big power invasions, Kim is unlikely to say yes. He may agree to re-enter the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty or to a gradual dismantling of the nuclear arsenal but conditional upon certain measures the US will have to take. Such a scenario once again takes us to the six-party talks that went on from 2003 to 2007. Apart from North Korea and the US, the other countries involved in the discussions were China, Russia, Japan and South Korea. But largely due to the US failure in fulfilling its part of the deal, the talks collapsed, leading to North Korea emerging as a full-fledged nuclear state.
Given the geopolitics of the issue and Trumps ambitions, the breakthrough lies in efforts to work out a win-win formula for not only North Korea, the US and South Korea, but, more importantly, also for China.

## Title: White collar and blue collar

White collar and blue collar
	
No industry can thrive for long without a healthy balance between white collar professionals and blue collar labourers

Jayasiri Samaratunga, who has been involved in both the private and the public sector in the construction industry and thus is acutely aware of the problems afflicting both, once told me in straightforward terms, No one wants his or her daughter to marry a mason baas, and that is why this industry lacks adequate bluecollar workers.
In the end, we have to import labour, and in the end, if we dont address that issue, well have to keep looking outside. Aptly put, considering that what is true for construction and engineering in this respect is true of every other field: no one wants his or her child to get down and get dirty in manual labour. We are expected to become doctors, engineers, lawyers, accountants, and consultants. Those once held notions of honour and dignity in labour have all but completely gone, and what is left behind is a predicament. Addressing that predicament is no longer an option. Its a necessity. A vital one. 
Consider this. No industry can thrive for long without a healthy balance between white collar professionals and blue collar labourers. This isnt a convenient truth, its the only truth, and insofar as the problems of labour shortages in this country are concerned, its the truth that matters the most. The Electricity Board needs its share of engineers just as much as it needs a share of workers and support staff, drivers and repairers, and the Water Board needs it share of assessors and experts just as much as it needs its share ofmeter readers.
From the ivory tower liberalism of the early days, we came to a consumerist society, which privileged practicality over scholasticism and which came to privilege subjects that reflected this new way of thinking
Forget the fact that the latter in both cases are paid lowly, and sometimes abnormally so, and remember the painful fact that even if they are paid handsomely, their jobs are looked down upon. Its class consciousness at one level, a gross misconception at another. The ball, as always, has got to start rolling from one place. Our education system. 
Our education system
If one peruses the history of our education system, one notices a radical shift from the immediately post-colonial period to the present. Right after independence, our education system, which incidentally had not yet bifurcated between the elite schools and the non-elite schools the way it has today, and which included in particular our Universities, continued to privilege a rift between education and its applicability. In other words, the social impact of what one learned was divorced from what one actually was taught. That is how the arts, more particularly the liberal humanities, were seen as ivory tower subjects, epitomised in novel after novel (Akkara Paha) and film after film (Walmath Uwo) which depicted this conflict as subsisting between the old and the young. Divorced from their surroundings, those who had studied and remained unemployed took to the streets, protested, and in the end, attempted to topple an entire Government (the historical progression from the one to the other has been charted by so many, including Gamini Samaranayake, who contended at the 1971 insurrection showed, for the first time, that the government was fragile). 
From the ivory tower liberalism of the early days, we came to a consumerist society, which privileged practicality over scholasticism and which came to privilege subjects that reflected this new way of thinking. The arts, obviously, were out, and subjects and fields which promoted the white collar over the blue collar (in a rather crude sense) were up: the professional fields. An offshoot of this was the divorce of practicality and scholasticism of another sort; one which led many to perpetuate prejudices against manual labour to such an extent that manual labour was seen as something to evade. The end result, I think, is an agglomeration of professional White Collarites, at the cost of the workers and labourers on whom the future of any industry really depends. The results have been startling and stark; we are currently witnessing a sustained brain drain of those same professionals who owe their lives, and education, to this country. 
Added to these are problems of proper remuneration, job security, and stability. Jayasiri Samaratunga told me as much when he observed, in relation to the construction industry, that To date, we havent implemented EPF and ETF provisions for workers. To make matters worse, construction jobs are unstable, hardly the 9 to 5 job some make it out to be even now. If youre a builder, for instance, you cant expect to be in one place. Your work may take you to every corner of the country. We also have peak and off-peak seasons. During the monsoon period, construction jobs are few and far in-between. The solution, according to Samaratunga and (again) in the context of the industry, was to not just attract, but retain workers in a way that accrues benefits to them. But that has been stalled by another problem: Most labourers are frequently seen as freelancers, who are goaded into one job and then abandoned. As a result, we have never bothered to take a proper census of the people in this industry. 
Twilight generation
The generation which immediately preceded us were a twilight generation: they grew up in a carefree world, but grew up to a career life that called for routine over individuality. Just as the arts and the liberal humanities were seen as the only path to success, morally and economically, at a time when economic fortunes were changing for the worse, today medicine, accountancy, and the law are seen as preferred career paths because they were the preferences of that earlier generation. But what is true for them, as most would concede, isnt what is true for the generation that followed them. In this sense two factors stand out. 
The first is that payment methods and gateways have imploded to such an extent that freelancing, in whatever field, has become more the norm than the exception. Be it in such preferred industries as construction and journalism and even advertising, freelancing has come to represent stability in a way that even 9-to-5 jobs do not, because when set against a bleak economic backdrop (in Sri Lanka), even the latter seems unstable enough. The usual attitude towards work has, in other words, been replaced by one which does not view freelancing and hacksaw, non-routine jobs unfavourably.
This has been aided in no small part by the implosion of mobile technology (Sri Lankas mobile phone penetration rate, at more than 100%, attest to this) that has made the divorce between home and office virtually, though not completely, obsolete. Compounding this is the attitude of the young: as I have pointed out, the young I have interviewed feel that the old have abandoned them needlessly, and that the professionals  the accountants, the doctors, the politicians  have cheated on their country. 
The second is the overriding problem of how we approach our education system; we think in terms of numbers, of quantity, over quality. Theres no point, after all, in opening up foundations dedicated to the arts if the objective of those foundations is to take in as many youngsters as possible. The end goal should be to transform them into cohesive artists, or whatever professional, without making them undergo a process of rote learning. In the system, what is often privileged is memory. That, and the obsession over passing exams (a cultural attitude which betrays our inability to adapt to the changing times, since if we cant successfully wade through a system, the only solution we propose is that we get through it piecemeal, which is what passing exams is by the way), compounds the problem of quantities in our schools and universities so much that any attempt at reforming these flaws is seen as intrusions by outside vested interests. (To be fair though, such reforms, like the Chandrika Bandaranaike regime proposals for restructuring our schools, were in fact inadvertent exercises in structural adjustment and economic liberalisation, at the cost of the poor.) 
The usual attitude towards work has, in other words, been replaced by one which does not view freelancing and hacksaw, non-routine jobs unfavourably
Sri Lankas population will continue to grow, and the demands on our resources, including electricity and water, will continue to grow with it. Unless and until the elders realise that not everyone can or should become an engineer or doctor or lawyer, that unless the divorce between practicality and scholasticism is addressed, along with our collective, recent distrust with professionals, and that its not something to be ashamed of to become a manual labourer or painter or filmmaker, we cant hope for an education system that balances quantity and quality. In the meantime, we will continue eating up our country (what little of it is left), and insist that our children become the professionals we have enough and more of, until a brain drain on the one hand, and a severe lack of manual workers on the other, results. The end, if this is what it is, can only be bleak.

Workforce warned soon after re-opening
	

A business establishment connected to a leading politico, kept closed for three months, re-opened recently and resumed operations.

The day the establishment was re-opened, a high-up on the management issued a severe warning to the workforce saying, We know that there are some workers here bent on bringing this establishment into disrepute by giving various types of information to the media. If we catch any of them sneaking anything about this place to the media, they will get the immediate sack. They will be taught a good lesson before being chased out!

Yahapalanaya works for MR comeback
	


Sughandika Fernando exposed the whole justice system
Where the Courts of Law cannot deliver justice, no repairs or reforms were possible
There are thus definite and serious doubts about the role of the Judiciary and its independence
This unprincipled Unity Government cannot provide answers to issues the people need answers

A fortnight ago a video clip went viral on social media that left the whole of the Judiciary, the prosecuting agencies and the legal profession stark naked.
It was a personal narrative by a young female lawyer, Sughandika Fernando that exposed the whole justice system from top to bottom, with names, dates and places and her own involvement in each of the cases and incidents she mentioned.
She alleged the Courts from Magistrate to Supreme Court, the Bar Association of Sri Lanka, the local Bar Associations, senior lawyers, the Attorney Generals Department, the Police Department including its top officials and the politicians, as wholly corrupt, working together hand-in-glove to undermine Justice and fair play.
Most, unfortunately, the mainstream media does not think Ms Fernandos personal stories are worth further discourse in terms of justice and in relation to judicial independence.
In any country, where the Courts of Law cannot deliver justice, no repairs or reforms are possible.
This exposure tells us just that.
It is not the Judiciary alone that is tied in this nauseating chaos. Everything from professional ethics, politics to economy is in it.
As a profession, lawyers dont represent the interests of their clients. Obvious it is with suspects left in remand custody for years, not weeks.
Apprentices exploited to no end and junior female lawyers sexually abused too.
Her detailed exposure tells the Police and the legal profession play together for their own interests.
The Court Mudliyars also interfere in deciding dates and even rulings through various manipulations. Citing a case in which she appeared, she even named the then Deputy Solicitor General as manipulating cases of political interests through interpretations.
On her experience, independence in appearing for clients at times, bring numerous threats to lawyers.
Though most of Ms Fernandos tales are limited to her experience in Chilaw and the Gampaha District, they cannot be mere provincial distortions or a local sickness that can be cured on an issue basis.
They are tied in numerous ways to Colombo and the apex bodies of the Judiciary.
While media reports said President Sirisena was against the arrest of Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, the FR petition was re-fixed for hearing twice before allowing him to stay free with an interim stay order on his arrest for almost one year
All issues highlighted put together, Ms Fernendos exposure basically says, the judicial system as a whole from investigations through prosecution, is corrupt to the core and is politicised beyond repair.
We, therefore, have to accept, this Judiciary with all its line departments and the private bar, does not necessarily decide independently and is often partisan, due to politics and corruption at all levels.
There is no other way to explain the status of the Judiciary, given the fate of the three million US dollar Forex case, in which Ravi Karunanayake was indicted with two others and the case dragged on for six years from 2009 till a change of Government.
In 2015 May Karunanayake was cleared on technical grounds allowing the Attorney General to file papers with due amendments that during the past three years have not been attended to.
There is also no other way of explaining how Gotabhaya Rajapaksa can avoid arrest with an FR petition filed with the Supreme Court in May 2017 to date.
While media reports said President Sirisena was against the arrest of Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, the FR petition was re-fixed for hearing twice before allowing him to stay free with an interim stay order on his arrest for almost one year and still pending.
There is also no other explanation possible for unbelievably long detentions of Tamil youth without any charges, after many years of investigations by the TID and the CID.
Looking back, three Chief Justices of the Supreme Court, Sarath N. Silva CJ, Shiranee Bandaranayake CJ and Mohan Peiris CJ, are of very questionable track records.
Sarath N. Silva on his own accord accepted his ruling on Helping Hambantota case that was politically very sensitive, went against the people and made a public apology on it.
Shiranee Bandaranayake allowing President Rajapaksa to amend the Constitution to have an unrestricted number of terms under the 18 Amendment without a Referendum smack of political patronage.
She as CJ was in a conflict of interest with her husband holding a political appointment by President Rajapaksa.
There isnt much to say about Mohan Pieris as CJ, who was a direct political appointment by President Rajapaksa.
There are thus definite and serious doubts about the role of the Judiciary and its independence.
Even after this Yahapalanaya Government was installed, nothing systemic has changed, with a heavily politicised Constitutional Council (CC) nominating for appointments.
The CC constituted with seven Members of the present Parliament and three members called civil society representatives have been held responsible for partiality and bias in nominating Members to Independent Commissions, most of which are dysfunctional and ineffective.
The three civil society representatives are not seen playing any role in the CC.
There is no transparency in CC activities and no minutes of meetings in public domain. Nor do these three civil society representatives say, what they do and where they stood in nominating individuals to very important positions and Commissions.
In fact, the CC can meet without them, with the seven Parliamentary Members completing the quorum necessary. There is no reason, therefore, to expect the CC to function ethically, honestly and impartially.
Add these negatives to all that Ms Fernando said and the cumulative effect cannot leave any space for independence and fair play in our judicial system.
We are thus compelled to accept the co-sponsored UNHRC Resolution adopted at the 2015 September-October Sessions in Geneva was absolutely right. This Judiciary with untrustworthy and undependable investigating and prosecuting agencies in a Sinhala dominated and polarised society cannot be expected to act independently and in fairness to victims of other ethnic andreligious denominations.
If as Ms. Fernando kept saying and convincingly too, while investigations, interpretations, productions in Courts, fixing dates, suppressing evidence are all possible for the powerful, the rich and the corrupt, the likes of Jeyakumari Balendrans protesting in Vavuniya, Kilinochchi, Mullaithivu and Trincomalee, demanding answers for their missing family members at the hands of security forces, would hardly have space for justice.
More because this Yahapalana Government as often proved, is awfully biased towards Sinhala Buddhist sentiments and demands.
The Judiciary, after all, is the last resort for any citizen seeking justice.
Anyone who finds him or herself denied equal opportunities, fair play and believes was discriminated and unjustly treated by the State, can only plead for justice in a Court of Law.
Ms Fernandos long story about the entirety of this Judiciary and the legal profession is the story of the people who loiter every day on corridors of Courts of Law.
Perhaps some of the Court Reporters have more stories than even Ms Fernando to report on if they wish to be independent Reporters. Most journalists assigned for reporting court cases also have their favourites and interests to serve for. Thus, we are in a very complex and a pathetic situation that goes without questioning and social exposure. Whatever our political preferences are, it is a fact that this whole system is now beyond repair.
This cannot be reformed, unless within a total overhaul of the entire governing system based on an alternative to this insane free market economy that spreads its corrupt tentacles everywhere.
We need to go beyond preaching about the 2015 January mandate. There was no mandate in 2015 January for any serious reforms that can clean up the Judiciary, the State and the political system for good.
Whatever was told during election campaigning and in the election manifesto was for a mere marketing of the Common Candidate.
Politics of it was only about voting out Rajapaksa. What was thereafter doled out as Reforms; the 19 Amendment was a bundle contradiction that allows another horribly corrupt group embedded in this extremely corrupt economy to govern for four plus half years without an election.
This unprincipled and unholy alliance called a Unity Government cannot provide answers to any of the issues the people need answers for; democracy, economy, education, health, public transport and clean governance not just for the Colombo Urban Middle Class but for North-East as well.
It is thus hilarious and a sorry plight to see some of the urban pundits drawing up programs for and demanding pledges from this wobbling alliance to deliver on the 2015 January mandate.
Not accepting this cock and bull marriage in governance is rudderless, inefficient, and corrupt and cannot deliver even the basics the people need, these Colombo pundits have allowed another Rajapaksa comeback.
Changing names and faces, arguing for leadership replacement, demanding a new Constitution from this corrupt and racist Government will not get this society back to decent and quality living.
None of them is possible with this awfully corrupt political party leadership, professionals and the whole State with law enforcement agencies, the Judiciary, all being comfortable partners in a sordid game of racist Southern politics for personal gain.
Non-traditional or not, any President or PM left within this system would only represent the system to enjoy all the corruption and nepotism in it.
This free market economic model that sustains this wholly corrupt system, screwed to FDIs that we are told is the only way out, is a tested and proven failure during the past 40 years.
Forty years wealth and income are being stockpiled in Western Province breeding a filthy-rich, politically-powerful urban elite.
We, therefore, need to focus on an alternative holistic national development policy on a new economic model that can be inclusive and with social justice.
