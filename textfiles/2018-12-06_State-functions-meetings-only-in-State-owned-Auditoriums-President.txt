State functions, meetings only in State-owned Auditoriums: President


	

On the instructions of President Maithripala Sirisena, a circular had been issued by the media unit to notify ministries, departments and statutory boards to refrain from holding any functions, meetings or any other programmes relating to their affairs, in Hotels, especially in Luxury hotels.

The President had taken this step in order to curb the unnecessary expenditure incurred in holding these state functions in Luxury hotels when there are plenty of auditoriums belonging to the state and other institutions available for these purposes.
