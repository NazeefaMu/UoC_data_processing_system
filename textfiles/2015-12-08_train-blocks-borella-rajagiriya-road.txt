Heavy traffic was reported for more than an hour in Borella, Rajagiriya and the surrounding areas today because of a train which had stalled at the level crossing on Cotta Road due to a technical fault.
However, the Control Room said if the train had derailed, it would have taken about four to five hours to clear the line.
It said technicians had been sent to rectify the fault and get the train moving.
“A relief train was sent to the location and the faulty train was moved out of the way by 12.50 pm,” the Control Room said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)
