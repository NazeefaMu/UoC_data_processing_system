Arjun Aloysius’ Personal Assistant Steve Samuel arrived at the PCoI a short while ago to give a statement with regard to the Central Bank Bond issuance.

Samuel’s Counsel informed that his client was admitted to the hospital due to a chest pain last week and is unable to appear before the Commission.

However, at the end of the yesterday’s proceedings, Justice Prasanna Jayawardena informed a counsel who was appearing for Arjun Aloysius’ Personal Assistant Steve Samuel that the Commission wants him to be present the PCoI today because he was discharged from hospital.
