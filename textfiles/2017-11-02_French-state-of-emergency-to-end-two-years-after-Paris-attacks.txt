French state of emergency to end, two years after Paris attacks


	



 

DPA, 01st NOVEMBER, 2017- Wednesday is the last day of France’s state of emergency, imposed after terrorist attacks on November 13, 2015 in which 130 people were killed.


The state of emergency is due to lapse automatically on November 1 at the end of its sixth extension, voted by parliament in July.


Instead a number of more restricted security measures, signed into law on Monday by President Emmanuel Macron, will come into force.


“A promise kept: we are ending the state of emergency on November 1 while reinforcing the security of our fellow citizens,” Macron wrote on Twitter.


Nobody doubts that, as Interior Minister Gerard Collomb said after Macron signed the law, “The terrorist threat remains great.”
