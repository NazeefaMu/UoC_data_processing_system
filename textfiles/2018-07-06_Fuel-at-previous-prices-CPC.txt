As such a CPC spokesman said the Thursday night’s price increases would not affect CEYPETCO fuel stations.

“The Finance Ministry has informed us of the price revision on Thursday. However, we have not issued a circular on increased prices for fuel stations due to a Presidential direction,” he said.
