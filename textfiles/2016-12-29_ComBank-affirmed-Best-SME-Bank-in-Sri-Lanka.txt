The Commercial Bank of Ceylon has been declared the‘Best SME Bank’ in Sri Lanka in 2016 by International Finance Magazine (IFM) of the UK, for ‘making a significant difference and adding value, and achieving the highest standards of innovation and performance’for Small and Medium Enterprise clients. 
The award also recognises the Bank’s contribution to raising the bar in the local finance industry, including in corporate social responsibility and better corporate governance, in IFM’s ‘Financial Awards’ category.
Commercial Bank Deputy General Manager – Personal Banking Sandra Walgama was in Singaporerecently to accept the award at a gala ceremony at which many award winners from across the world gathered to celebrate their achievements.
“This is another remarkable achievement for Commercial Bank, and this award signifies our value addition and quality of service in the SME sector,” Walgama stated. “SMEs are significant contributors to the national economy and represent an extremely important customer segment. Winning this award encourages the Bank to strive even harder tosupportour SME clients.”
Among the international banks recognised in different categories at this year’s IFM Awards are Standard Chartered Bank (in Bangladesh, Singapore and Vietnam); ANZ (Singapore and Vietnam); Bank of East Asia (Hong Kong); Bank Rakyat and Kenanga Investment Bank (Malaysia); Bank Alfalah (Pakistan); OCBC (Singapore); Taipei Fuban Bank and Cathay United Bank (Taiwan); Habib Bank (UK) and Maritime Bank and Saigon Commercial Bank (Vietnam). In its announcement on the awards, IFM said the finalists undergo extensive scrutiny on the basis of innovation, growth, sustainability and their contribution towards the society among other key factors before the final award winners are announced. “Apart from recognising the key performers in the industry, the IFM Award makes a concerted effort to shine the spotlight on organisations in niche segments and those that exhibit brilliance in the unsung corners of the finance industry,” the magazine said.

The development of SME banks, especially in emerging markets, has a lot of obstacles including lack of reliable markets and the difficulty of building a sound SME loan portfolio.”
