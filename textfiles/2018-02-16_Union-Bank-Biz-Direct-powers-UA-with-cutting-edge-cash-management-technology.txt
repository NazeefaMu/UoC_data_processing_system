Also, some businesses don’t monitor for cheque frauds or unauthorised transactions, which could be a costly oversight if an incident were to occur. Inefficiencies like these that cost businesses both time and money, could be completely avoided with an electronically managed process. Union Bank Biz Direct is one such groundbreaking cash management solution which would change the way businesses manage their cash flows by adding a layer of security while boosting efficiencies by a few notches. We are the only local private commercial bank to offer a comprehensive cash management solution under one product and Union Bank will continue to pioneer this domain by continuously enhancing our Biz Direct solution to meet the changing payment and cash management needs of corporates and SMEs of the country.”
