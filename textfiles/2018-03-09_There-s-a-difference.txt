A onetime powerful lady turned her guns on a very high political authority during an informal discussion among heavyweights of a main political party, they say. 

 


The lady who was in an ugly mood reportedly took the high political authority to task posing questions such as “Where would he be today, if we didn’t give him the necessary push?”


At this stage, a party stalwart had told her, “Madam, why don’t we tell his failings to his face when we meet him tomorrow?”


However, at the next day’s meeting with the high political authority, the lady had maintained a deafening silence. 


The party stalwart had reminded her of his previous day’s suggestion: “Madam, why don’t you take up with him the issues you raised yesterday? “


However, the lady kept on perusing a file somebody had given her even without raising her head, they say.
