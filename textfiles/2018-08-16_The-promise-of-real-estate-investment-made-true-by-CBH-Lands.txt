Land as an asset has been valued for centuries. Property ownership is seen as a social status marker as well as a secure investment at times of need. Real Estate is increasingly becoming the most attractive investment option, as the land value continues to rise not only in the urban areas but also expanding to the rural areas. However, the predicaments of investing in land is the strenuous process of finding the most suitable land for one’s need, the legal and documentation process as well as the credibility of the company and the assurance of value for money. 

This hardship is completely addressed by CBH Lands through their in-depth knowledge of real estate, commitment to offer the best in the market and highly skilled teams who efficiently handle every step of the process. Mainly based in Kurunegala and Homagama, CBH Lands are also available in other suburbs. The main plots in Kurunegala are diverse in landscape which also include paddy field - facing plots and river - facing plots. The lands are selected at rapidly growing real estate hot spots that will ensure an increment of land value over the years. For instance, Kurunegala will be a focal location in the Central Expressway which is due to be completed by 2019, reducing travel time to Kurunegala to a mere 1 hour from Colombo, thus ensuring a high return on investment to buyers. 

CBH Lands is probably the only real estate investment house in the country, which is not only involved in the sale of land, but also in real estate investment consulting. The company conducts the total process of purchasing, developing, plotting and selling real estate sites which are handpicked by the experts. Each land undergoes a process of thorough legal scrutiny and documentation clearance. The company also takes care of infrastructure which includes constructing the roads, tarring, constructing the drainage and sewerage systems, and obtaining electricity and water. CBH Lands goes the extra length to clear all documentation and approvals, which at certain points involve around 21 government institutions, thus providing the buyer with a completely clear land purchase. However, this does not sky rocket the land value, as plots are even available from Rs. 65,000/- per perch onwards at CBH Lands, which is made possible through the wide range of land options spread across the Kurunegala district.

“Purchasing land is a decision made with high consideration. Unfortunately the whole process discourages many potential investors. Therefore we established ourselves as a consulting house for real estate, and invest largely on obtaining the best lands and developing them to the highest capacity before sale,” stated Yatila Wijemanne, Chairman and Co-Founderof CBH Lands (Pvt) Ltd.  

The wealth of experience owned by CBH Lands provides buyers with the kind of consultancy unavailable elsewhere. For instance, bulk buying of property for future disposal is a common real estate investment trend. However, most property owners face issues at the point of disposal due to unplanned fragmentation. CBH Lands offers guidance and a systematic block out system which ensures that the land does not lose its value to factors such as in-roads. Furthermore, CBH Lands has fast become a preferred company for first time investors, who seek advocacy in making the correct decision in their first real estate investment. 

All land plots available through CBH Lands are pre-facilitated, as they are invested upon by the company and further developed. The process is looked into much detail to the point where certain land plots have been declined at the time of transfer due to unavailability of clear documents. Moreover, lands that come through individuals claiming power-of-attorney are not facilitated by the company. These processes are in place to ensure the buyer with the much needed assurance of credibility and purchasing a clear land.

Throughout the years of experience in the industry, CBH Lands has also initiated two schemes to benefit women working overseas and tri forces current and retired. “We used to come across instances where the women working abroad, especially in the Middle Eastern countries, send money to purchase land, but when the final transaction is complete, often the husband or another family member requests the land to be written under their name. It also happens with the tri forces. We directly discourage this and take extra steps to ensure that the land is transferred to the person who actually pays for it. It is for these reasons that we established the Ranliyaand Ranawiruschemes,” added Manjarie Tissera Wijemanne Deputy Chairman and Co – Founder of CBH Lands (Pvt) Ltd.
Investment in real estate out of Colombo is increasingly proving to be profitable, the best example being Galle. The wealth of CBH Lands in Kurunegala and other areas have attracted many potential investors who have seen the timely opportunity and promising rise of land value. The lands can be utilized as future endowments, second or holiday homes, development and re-selling or leasing, or as basic assets. CBH Land’s attention to detail in documentation, skills and experience in development, excessive knowledge of the industry together with their consultancy offers a complete and seamless purchase of the best quality land.
