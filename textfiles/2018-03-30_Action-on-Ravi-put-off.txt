The UNP working committee had decided to put off taking action against Former Minister Ravi Karunanayake till it gets the opinion from the Attorney General on the recommendations made on the former Minister over the bond commission report, party sources said yesterday.

The Bond commission recommended that legal action should be taken against Mr. Karunanayake if it is proven that he had committed some offence. The commission said Mr. Karuanayakae may have misled it during questioning.

The UNP working committee later decided to get the opinion of the Attorney General in this regard. Party then appointed a commission headed by Minister Tilak Marapana which recommended that former Minister should be removed from the Assistant leader’s post. However the working committee had decided to put off taking action against Mr. Karunanayake till Attorney general comes out with his opinion. (Yohan Perera)
