Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa has been asked to report to PRECIFAC tomorrow and on the day after to record a further statement in connection with the non-payment of money owed to the ITN.
Mr. Rajapaksa was summoned by the commission on four previous occasions with regard to this controversy.
The recording of the evidence of ITN Chief Internal Auditor Manjula Alagiyawanna had to be stopped abruptly when he appeared to be contradicting himself. The proceedings were postponed for November 19 and 20.
UPFA MPs Keheliya Rambukwella, Dullas Allahapperuma and Susil Premajayantha also gave statements to the the Presidential Commission of Inquiry to Investigate and Inquire into Serious Acts of Fraud, Corruption and Abuse of Power, State Resources and Privileges (PRECIFAC).
Former ITN Chairman Anura Siriwardena, General Manager Aruna Wijesinghe, Deputy General Manager (Marketing) Upali Ranjith and Marketing Assistant Manager Dilip Priyantha Wickremasinghe were also summoned on earlier occasions. (Ajith Siriwardana)
