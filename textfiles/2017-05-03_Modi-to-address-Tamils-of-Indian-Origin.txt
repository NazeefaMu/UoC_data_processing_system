Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is to address Tamils of Indian Origin at the Norwood town in Nuwara-Eliya and hold discussions with the Tamil Progressive Alliance (TPP) during his visit to Sri Lanka for the UN Vesak celebrations, PP MP Mylvaganam Tilakarajah said yesterday.

The Nuwara-Eliya District has a concentration of Tamils of Indian Origin with five members from two different political parties representing them in Parliament. Their vote was crucial at the 2015 presidential election which was won by Presidential Maithripala Sirisena.

Mr. Modi will arrive in the country next week and during his short stay, he will also participate in a function to mark the opening of a hospital in Dickoya built with financial assistance from India.

India has funded numerous projects for the benefit of people of Indian origin living in the upcountry. (Kelum Bandara)
