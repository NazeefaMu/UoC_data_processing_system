Colombo Chief Magistrate Lal Ranasinghe Bandara issued warrants for the arrest of IUSF Convener Lahiru Weerasekara, a student monk and four others in connection with a case filed against them by the Cinnamon Gardens Police on charges of causing a public nuisance during a protest outside the University Grants Commission in October, 2015.

The arrest warrants were issued because they had failed to appear in court when the case was taken up for hearing today. The case was postponed for August 25. (Nimanthi Ranasinghe)
