Sampath Bank, a forerunner in ensuring the wellbeing of the country and its citizens, has been recognized as the ‘Overall Best Corporate Citizen’ of 2015 at the Best Corporate Citizen Sustainability Awards presented by the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce.
This award assesses the unsurpassed sustainability practices adopted by corporate entities in Sri Lanka and recognizes corporate entities that create an immensely positive impact to the triple bottom line, which envelopes the environment, society and economy, whilst engaging in its main business. 
“To be recognized as the Best Corporate Citizen is first and foremost greatly humbling, as for Sampath Bank, contributing to the society in which we operate is of great importance. As much as we focus on our line of business, our commitment to social responsibility is driven by the bank’s heartfelt belief that the contribution towards the people, planet and economy remains the foundation of our strategy for long-term value and corporate growth,” said Sampath Bank PLC Pillar Head of CSR and Deputy General Manager Marketing and Business Development Tharaka Ranwala. 
Before offering a meaningful insight to Sampath Bank’s commitment to the triple bottom line, Ranwala stated, “The bank’s higher state of excellence is governed under the triple bottom line which Sampath Bank focuses on as a clear strategy to achieve long-term sustainability. As much as we do our business and have corporate growth and profitability in our fore front, we believe the long-term sustainability of the bank also lies on how we remain focused on the triple bottom line.” 
With that being said, Ranwala highlighted the many actions and initiatives which echoed the bank’s commitment to the principles of the triple bottom line and also depicted its commitment to ensure overall sustainability. 
Starting off with the environment, Ranwala explained that despite the minimal impact caused to the environment due to the nature of the banking business, the bank is profoundly committed to safeguarding the environs in the sphere the business is conducted. 
From adhering to environmental credentials to adhering to a voluntary code of ethics inclusive of Sampath Bank’s six Eco Guidelines and Environment pledge, Ranwala brought to light the initiatives carried out by the bank’s very own Sampath Nature Protection Club (SNaPC) founded with the mission to protect and conserve the environment. One of which is the Coral Restoration Project designed to maintain the rich biodiversity and marine eco-systems surrounding the coral reef located off the coast of the Polhena beach. 
Furthermore, while the bank introduces energy efficient solutions and advocates actions that save natural resources, Ranwala also pointed out the bank’s drive to develop environmentally conscious employees by conducting a community based initiative by SNaPC known as Outstanding Eco Teams, a competition that encourages employees to think green. 
Bringing focus to social sustainability and the people of the country, Ranwala emphasized on the bank’s commitment to create values for stakeholders including employees, customers and society as a whole. 
“In order to present the future to the people of the country, we believe the citizens need to have the suitable surroundings focused on by corporates such as ourselves, so that these individuals can swiftly move forward in life in the long run,” he added.
Sampath Bank’s commitment towards uplifting the wellbeing society can be noted in its Water Purification Project aimed to provide clean drinking water to the villagers of Poonewa and combat chronic kidney disease, and Sampath Pasala initiative driven to identify and develop schools in areas of basic infrastructure and uplifting the educational standards in rural areas of Sri Lanka. Ranwala also distinguished the bank’s dedication and efforts to gain and maintain customer loyalty through innovation and best practices and preserve employee trust through empowerment and encouragement. 
Furthermore, he also noted the proactive actions taken by Sampath Bank in order to meet the legal and regulatory requirements with respect to all aspects of the business.
