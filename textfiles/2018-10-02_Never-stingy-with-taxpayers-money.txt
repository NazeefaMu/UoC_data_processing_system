Never stingy with taxpayers’ money!


	

Some 700 air fresheners have reportedly been purchased for use inside the main council which moved into a brand-new building complex recently.


These air fresheners costing Rs. 16,000 each have to be refilled at least twice a month and one refill would cost Rs. 6,000.


Even the offices of top authorities in the country do not use air fresheners considering it an unnecessary expenditure item, they say.


Employees of the council would often make the wisecrack, “Our Lokka, a jolly good fellow, is never stingy with taxpayers’ money!”
