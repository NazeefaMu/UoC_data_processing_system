Ceylon Workers Congress (CWC) Leader and Parliamentarian Arumugam Thondaman today requested all plantation workers to join in an indefinite strike from tomorrow.

He said this after a meeting with the senior management of plantation companies today. He said the employers did not agree with their request to increase their daily wages to Rs. 1000.

MP Thondaman said they held a discussion with former Finance Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa earlier. During the discussion, the finance ministry had suggested providing loans with zero interests to workers. However, this proposal was also turned down by the Plantation companies.
