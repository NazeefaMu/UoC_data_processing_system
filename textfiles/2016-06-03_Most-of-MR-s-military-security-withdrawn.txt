The Military security provided to former President Mahinda Rajapaksa has been completely withdrawn, the joint opposition said.

 MP Udaya Gammanpila said 54 military personnel out of the 104 military security detail had been removed yesterday.

“Another 25 were asked to report to the Army Head quarters today and the remaining 25 were asked to report to headquarters tomorrow,” he said.

He said if anything were to happen to Mr. Rajapaksa because of lack of security, the President should take responsibility. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
