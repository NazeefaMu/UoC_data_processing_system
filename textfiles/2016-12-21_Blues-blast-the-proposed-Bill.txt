Blues blast the proposed Bill


	



 

The Blue party’s Diyawanna group informally met at the office of a party high-up the other day.

 


Their discussion centered on a proposed Bill designed to bring all major development projects in the country under one Ministry.


At the outset, a seasoned party senior had explained the dire consequences that could flow from the proposed concentration of power relating to the country’s overall development in the hands of one political authority. A vociferous one from Uva had next attacked the ‘development operations under one umbrella’ concept. Several state purohitas who contributed their views expressed the fear that the proposed legislation will provide room for ‘an outside authority’ to make inroads into their subject areas. 


Finally, they reached consensus to take a decision on the proposed Bill at a special meeting of their Central Committee. Some of them had put their foot down saying they should not hesitate to oppose legislation of this nature.
