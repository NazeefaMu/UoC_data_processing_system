Eight bullet-proof cars used by VIPs including former presidents are to be displayed at the Gangarama Temple in Hunupitiya, the Presidential Secretariat said today.

Eight such vehicles used by former presidents, were recently dumped in mid sea.

Sources said the supplier companies were reported to have agreed to accept them, provided freight and recycling costs were by the government.

Meanwhile, the Presidential Secretariat said 95 vehicles used by the presidential staff were leased to 16 government institutions, including the Civil Security Department and the Immigration and Emigration Department. (Sujith Hewajulige)
