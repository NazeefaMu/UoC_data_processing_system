A sixteen-year-old boy had allegedly drowned in Kande Ela falls in Nuwara Eliya yesterday, while he was on a picnic with his friends, the Police said.

The investigation was launched on the complaint filed by the parents of the victim boy. The boy, Nimesha Dulanga, had come on a picnic with eight friends telling parents that he was attending tuitions, the Police said.

The preliminary investigations had found that the boy drowned, while he was bathing at the falls all alone, the Police said.

However, it is found that his friends had returned home yesterday, but they did not inform the incident to anyone.
