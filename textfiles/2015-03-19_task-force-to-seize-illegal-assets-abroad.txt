	President Maithripala Sirisena has decided to establish a 13-member Special Presidential Task Force (SPTF) to track down and seize illegally acquired assets in other countries owned by Sri Lankans and transfer them to the government.

	“We have information that a minimum of US$ 10 billion has been deposited in foreign banks by Sri Lankans and US$ 3 billion of it has been deposited in the National Bank of Dubai. We are aware that little over US$ 1 billion has been transferred to another location from an account held by a member of a leading family in Sri Lanka soon after the Presidential election from the Dubai bank and another one billion has also been transferred in US$ 500 packages after that by a powerful Ministry Secretary and a Parliamentarian,” he said.     
	The cabinet memo submitted by President Sirisena says state assets and revenue which have been unlawfully acquired or procured by Sri Lankan nationals and other persons acting on behalf of them and are being concealed or kept outside Sri Lanka by such persons are to be probed and effective steps would be taken to seize and return them to Sri Lanka to be confiscated and vested in the General Treasury.

Allegations of Bribery or Corruption and the Financial Crimes Investigation Division of the Police Department, and to foreign law enforcement and prosecuting agencies, reliable information and investigational findings, which may be useful to such authorities in the conduct of criminal investigations for the purpose of prosecuting offenders.

	The Taskforce will be empowered to obtain information from any public Officer or Ministry, Department or Statutory Body of the Government of Sri Lanka for the purpose of discharging the functions.
