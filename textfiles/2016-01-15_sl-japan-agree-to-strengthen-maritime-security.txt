Sri Lanka and Japan had agreed to take measures to strengthen the cooperation on maritime security and also to develop mutual understanding between the two countries, the Defence Ministry said in a statement today.
The agreement has been made at the inaugural Sri Lanka-Japan Dialogue on Maritime Security, Safety and Oceanic Issues, which was held at the Ministry on Wednesday.
It said the dialogue was a result of the visit by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to Japan last year and an outcome of the Joint Declaration on a Comprehensive Partnership between Sri Lanka and Japan concluded during the visit.
“The two sides had a frank exchange of views on a range of subjects including the situation in the Indo-Pacific Ocean Region, cooperation in the areas of Maritime Security and Safety, regional multilateral initiatives including activities within the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF), the Regional Cooperation Agreement on Combating Piracy and Armed Robbery against Ships in Asia (ReCAAP) and partnership between the two countries as maritime nations,” the statement said.
Ministry Secretary Karunasena Hettiarachchi said the longstanding friendly relationship between the two countries was one that was characterized by ‘genuine affection’.
He had also expressed appreciation for the commitments extended by Japan to ensure maritime law enforcement and mitigation of disaster risks and environment protection.
Meanwhile, Japanese Ambassador Kenichi Suganuma said that during the tenure of President Maithirpala Sirisena, Japan-Sri Lanka relations has moved into a new era and this has been further consolidated by the establishment of a Comprehensive Partnership Agreement between the two countries during the visit of Prime Minister Wickremesinghe.
The Ambassador referred to the strategically important geopolitical location of Sri Lanka overlooking the main Sea Lanes of Communication (SLOC) in the Indian Ocean.
