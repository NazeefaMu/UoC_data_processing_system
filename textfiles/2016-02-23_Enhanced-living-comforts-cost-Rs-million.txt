Enhanced living comforts cost Rs.15 million


	



 

A yahapalanaya purohita has utilized Rs.15 million from the funds of a state-owned corporation coming under his Ministry to renovate his official residence. 

 


This official residence located at Gregory’s Road in Colombo belongs to the Ministry of Public Administration. However, there are three official quarters belonging to the corporation at Sarana Road and two of them are being currently occupied by a Deputy General of the corporation and an additional secretary of the Ministry in question.   


The security personnel of this loss making corporation themselves have been deployed to provide security to this official residence now being given a new look.


“We cannot understand why on earth the Ministry is using the funds of the loss making corporation to renovate a building belonging to another Ministry when it can channel these monies into putting up an additional official residence for the corporation itself. Isn’t it common sense,” a corporation employee asked.


By the way, the purohita seems to have forgotten that he will have to vacate this official residence renovated at a massive expense if he loses at the next general polls.
