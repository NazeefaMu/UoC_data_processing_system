Governor Tales
Sir Herbert Stanley 1927-1931


by Bassano, vintage print, 1937
Now we are gradually coming on to the threshold of Sri Lankan independence while the governors themselves fashioned their acts accordingly. For example Sir Stanley was responsible for the preliminary work regarding the bringing down of the throne and crown of our kings from England to which land they were taken after the capture of Kandy.
Why the removal? To rid the island of insignia that could provoke rebellion. The crown and throne were actually brought back to the island by the duke and duchess of Gloucester during a subsequent governorship.
Anyway back to Stanley's bio data. Born in July 1872, Eton and Oxford educated, he soon got interested in the colonial empire mostly in South Africa. First he acted there as private secretary of the first governor general, Gladstone. Then he was promoted to imperial secretary and in 1927 was appointed governor of Ceylon at the late age of 52.
If Stanley had made a name for himself by this time, in varied capacities, one was that he was married to the most beautiful woman in the world (Hulugalle).
Coming back to more prosaic stuff, by this time the report of the Donoughmore commission had been presented to the British parliament. Back at home it got subject to much debate and discussion in the legislative council, especially the matter of the grant of universal suffrage. Especially arose the issue of considering the grant of universal suffrage, all and sundry, even to the newly come estate Indian population. The abolition of communal representation too raised much igniting matter.
Sir Ponnambalam Ramanathan, the leader of the unofficial members in the LC was one who opposed the matter of universal suffrage, vehemently arguing that it would lead o socialistic legislation. He also argued, maybe be correctly that educational advance should precede general enfranchisement.
Despite much opposition of taking away the main university away from Colombo, opposed even by some of the most powerful, it was in Stanley's tenure that the legislative council (LC) passed a motion for the establishment of a university in Kandy in March 1928. The opposition to this project was triggered by the concept that all major establishments should be in the capital. However the project went ahead.
A few months later the report of the Donoughmore commission was published while a new chamber was attached to this all important council that was steering the country's politics for a number of years.
These following events that were shared by the governorships of Sir Clifford and Stanley in 1927 should also be mentioned.
Steps being taken for the electrification of the island. With this end in view in March 1929 an electric power station in Kolonnawa opened. No doubt the island was on its way to getting electrified totally.
But Governor Stanley's heart was in South Africa just as governor Gregory" s heart was in Lanka. In 1931 he returned there as high commissioner for UK and later became governor of Southern Rhodesia and later settled down in Cape Town. He died at age of 82 years in 1955, well into our times. So he was one who passed the 70 limit.
