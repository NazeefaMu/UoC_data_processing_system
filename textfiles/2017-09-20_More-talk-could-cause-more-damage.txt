More talk could cause more damage!


	



 

A political authority in the highest echelons recently got his aides to arrange a meeting with the foreign media personnel to brief them on the topical national issues in the country and the government ‘s stand on them. And a date and time for the event was immediately set.

 


However, to everyone’s surprise, an official communique was issued last week-end announcing that the proposed meeting with foreign media personnel was cancelled. 


The discreet inquiries made by interested parties in this regard have brought to light the real reason for the cancellation of the proposed meeting: the fear that the questions likely to be asked at the proposed briefing would place the hosts in a tight spot. The Media Ministry mandarins had pointed out to Number One that the foreign media men would for sure seek clarification on matters like the government’s stand on a former army commander’s much publicized assertion about the war crimes and the conflicting views on the proposed Constitution and other important issues being expressed by various purohitas. “This being the situation, the outcome of such a meeting with foreign media is likely to cause more damage than good to the government’s image,” the mandarins had explained. 
Number One had accepted this advice and that led to the cancellation of the meeting, they say.
