	The Colombo University yesterday distanced itself from the survey released by the Opposition Common candidate's office which showed 53% victory for Maithripala Sirisena.

Colombo University Registrar K.A.S.Edward in a statement said:
"In this connection, I wish to categorically state that this survey has been conducted by a certain individual without the knowledge of the University and as such the University cannot take any responsibility for the outcome of the survey. Further I am of the view that the heading of the news item tends to mislead the general public."
