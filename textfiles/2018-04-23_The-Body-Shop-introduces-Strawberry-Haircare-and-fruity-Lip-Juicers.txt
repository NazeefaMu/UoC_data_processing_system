The Body Shop introduces Strawberry Haircare and fruity Lip Juicers


	



The Body Shop is bringing back fruity, nostalgic scents with the launch of Strawberry Haircare and Lip Juicers in stores. These deliciously fruity concoctions don’t just smell good- they’re packed with powerful ingredients to elevate daily care routines. 

Strawberry Haircare is a combination of two simple products - the Strawberry Clearly Glossing Shampoo and the Strawberry Clearly Glossing Conditioner. Both are made from strawberry juice sourced from Italy which gives hair a fresh, fruity and sweet scent. The addition of Community Trade organic aloe vera from Mexico adds a healing touch. 

The Glossing Shampoo is gentle on the hair and scalp and great for daily use- the non-greasy formula leaves hair looking visibly shinier, smoothing the hair cuticles without weighing the hair down. This is perfect for those with dull hair - the shampoo lathers easily and leaves behind glossy, shiny locks. The shampoo is formulated with Sodium Laureth Sulfate for gentle cleansing and foaming benefits that don’t leave hair dry, and glycerin to act as a humectant which locks moisture into the hair. 

The Strawberry Clearly Glossing Conditioner is a glossing and detangling formula that adds shine with a sweet strawberry scent. The lightweight formula smoothes hair cuticles for improved light reflection and shine without weighing hair down and from first use, hair looks visibly shiner, detangled, silky smooth and hydrated. The formula includes glycerin to lock moisture in and Community Trade Soya Oil from Brazil. 



The Lip Juicers are the newest addition to The Body Shop’s cruelty-free makeup collection. These 5 moisture boosting balms come in lip smacking flavours of fruity acai, luscious blueberry, juicy kiwi and kale. Inspired by superfood smoothies and just as potent, they are enriched with Community Trade organic Shea butter from Ghana. They contain no minerals, no paraffin and no petroleum. 

500 women from the Tungteiya Women’s Shea Butter Association in Ghana harvest freshly fallen shea nuts using traditional handcraft techniques to source the shea butter for the Lip Juicers. This is part of The Body Shop’s global commitment to enrich communities and livelihoods, an initiative that benefits 45,000 people every year.

Strawberry Haircare products and Lip Juicers are available at The Body Shop flagship store on Bagatale Road, Odel Alexandria Place and the Kandy City Centre.
