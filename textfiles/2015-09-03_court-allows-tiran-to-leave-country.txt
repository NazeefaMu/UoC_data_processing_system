Colombo Fort Magistrate today permitted former MP Tiran Alles to leave the country for a period of one month from September 10 to October 10.
His passport had been impounded by court in connection with a case over the funds of RADA.
Filing a motion before court, counsel for Alles made a request to release the passport as he wished to seek medical treatment in the UK.
Thereby court temporarily released his passport for a period of one month.(Lakmal Sooriyagoda)
