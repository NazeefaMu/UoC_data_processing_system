They are set to teach him a lesson


	



 

A plan is underway to stage a big revolt against the Western PC administration at the unveiling of its annual Budget for 2017, they say.

 


The JO rebels in the council took the initiative last year to oust the Heritage member Nishantha from his Ministerial office and they are now poised for a repeat performance targeting the chief purohita. 
Incidentally, the Betel leaf party commands the majority in the council with more than 50 members and at least 47 of them are die-hard loyalists of the former strongman. The opposition to the current council administration among the JO loyalists simmering for some time has begun boiling when the incumbent chief purohita described as an intimate of the Big Boss started launching tirades against the former strongman from public platforms. 


The rebels have now decided to upset the apple cart come the annual Budget just to teach a lesson to the chief purohita for criticizing their leader.  They are likely to muster a majority vote to defeat the estimates of the Education Ministry or an expenditure item of any other Ministry now being handled by the chief purohita.
