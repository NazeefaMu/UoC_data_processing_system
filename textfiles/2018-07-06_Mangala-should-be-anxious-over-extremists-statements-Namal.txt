Mangala should be anxious over extremists' statements: Namal


	

While stating that Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera should not be panicked over the law suits which would be filed against the media which are misinterpreting the facts, the Joint Opposition yesterday said instead Minister Samaraweera should be anxious over the statements made by the government ministers calling for the resurgence of the LTTE.

While referring to the controversial NY Times report, which alleged that a Chinese company had funded the campaign of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa in January 2015, JO group member MP Namal Rajapaksa said standing for the accuracy and filing a lawsuit would not be amounted to suppression of media.

He also said the joint opposition would work forward to establish a government with more media freedom with the leadership of former President Rajapaksa in near future.

“The government is in an attempt to conceal the bond scam through this NY Times report. A report has revealed that the US has funded US$ 585 million for three countries including Sri Lanka, Myanmar and Nigeria to establish peace. The government should investigate these facts also,” he said.

“We vehemently condemn the statement made by State Minister Vijayakala Maheswaran calling for the resurgence of the LTTE. There is no use of conducting disciplinary investigations. We are waiting for President Maithripala Sirisena to take legal actions against the State Minister,” he added. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)
