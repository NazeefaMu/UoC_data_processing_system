The most socially engaging bank in Sri Lanka, Seylan Bank, won 3 major international awards for its performance on the Social Media platform at the ‘Indo Lanka Customer Engagement Award’ organized by the ACEF Team.

The awards were bestowed for Seylan Bank’s innovative Seylan Office Challenge - Events & Promotions; Innovative Web Launch Campaign and as the Social media Brand of the year. These awards are an affirmation of the bank’s prime positioning as the pioneer of social media in Sri Lanka’s banking and finance sector.
Tilan Wijeyesekera, Deputy General Manager – Marketing and Personal Banking commented on the win by the bank, “We are delighted to bag these three awards which have been adjudged by an international team of judges. Seylan Bank prides itself on its close engagement with customers and over the past few years we have strengthened our social media strategy to better engage customers at a one on one level.

 It is significant that the criteria of the competition included all aspects of Concept, Media Strategy & Plan, Execution, Results and Innovative Approach. As a result of the efforts of our professional team to deliver the ultimate social media customer experience, we have been successful in positioning Seylan Bank as a true engagement driver instead of simply acquiring fans in the social media competitive category.

We have successfully benchmarked the international social media strategy across sectors and are privileged to note that our efforts have been recognized on an international level.”
Social and digital media channels of Seylan Bank are in the forefront of the new age media chapter in Sri Lanka.

Seylan Bank reached a social media landmark last quarter in the year 2015, reaching 300,000 fans on its Facebook page and that too with a far superior engagement score to its peers signifying the true engagement it has with its fans and customers.
