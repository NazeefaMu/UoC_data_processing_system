“The main objective of this cyber security management lab in Japan  would be to conduct joint research and conduct management training programmes on cyber security, information systems security, secure payments and cyber threat mitigation. Confirmation has already been received from top corporates to participate in our joint programmes, so that they are well aware of the threats and can take adequate measures to protect themselves and their business”.
Programmes will be done in conjunction with the Global IT Park in Niigata Prefecture where Epic Technology already operates from,” added Mudalige.
The International University of Japan was founded in 1982, as Japan’s first graduate-school-only university, with leaders who believe a unique vision representing business, government and world organizations. International University of Japan equips students with interdisciplinary skills covering politics, economic and management as well as historical and cultural perspectives to take on current global issues from their chosen professions.
