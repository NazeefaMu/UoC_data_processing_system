Following the instructions made by President Maithripala Sirisena, the Mahaweli Authority today said that it had taken measures to install a fence along the Viyana Canal at a cost of Rs.26.5 million.

Mahaweli Authority’s Director General Sarath Chandrasiri Vithana said the estimation for the project was approved at a meeting held this morning.  

The decision to install a fence was made after several vehicles toppled into the Canal. The most recent incident being an SUV found floating in the Canal yesterday.

The 13 km long Nikathupitiya-Mapakadawewa Road adjacent to the Viyana Canal was earlier used as a service route by the Mahaweli Authority.

Later, five kilometres of the road was acquired by the Road Development Authority (RDA) and developed as a B Class Road.

An RDA official said they produced a Road Safety Audit Report to the Mahaweli Authority in order to take precautions and minimise accidents, following a survey conducted on the instruction of RDA Provincial Director.

Earlier last month, the RDA had also sought approval for Rs. 62 million to install crash barriers in the identified risk zones along the canal.

According to the Road Safety Audit Report, a proposal had also been made to impose speed limits and set up lamp posts along the road to minimise accidents. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
