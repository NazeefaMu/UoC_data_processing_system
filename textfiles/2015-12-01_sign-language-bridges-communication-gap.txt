Sign language bridges communication gap


	


This person was appointed as our envoy to an Island Nation in Asia recently.
And he is said to be often using sign language to communicate with others at his diplomatic mission, they say.
Of course, he is not speech-impaired. The poor man has been compelled to use the sign language not having even a smattering of the language of ‘the white man’. By the way, though language-impaired, several titles come before his name.  They say he has got the high post thanks to his close connection to a very high authority in yahapalanaya.
