Responding to the media reports published recently that the SriLankan Airlines was adding brand new A320 Neo aircraft to its fleet, the Airline today stated that these aircraft were ordered by the former management of the SriLankan Airlines under the previous Government.

 “What we are doing here is dealing with the aircraft orders placed by the previous management. In that process we have managed to save money by either terminating some of the orders or by selectively adding to the fleet appropriate aircraft based on the airlines’ requirements,” the airline said in a statement.

Accordingly, the airline has already terminated the leases on four A350 aircraft and is currently negotiating with the Airbus on the status of four more similar aircraft scheduled for delivery from 2020 onwards.
