A panicked warthog's desperate struggle to escape from the clutches of a hungry pregnant leopard has been captured in a series of stunning action shots in Townsville, Australia.

Images show the 130-pound leopard stalking its prey in a thicket of bushes before the warthog becomes aware it is about to become dinner and makes a run for it.

Unfortunately for the warthog - a fearsome animal in its own right - his speed is no match for that of the predator who quickly catches up and pounces before enjoying a well-earned meal. (Daily Mail)
