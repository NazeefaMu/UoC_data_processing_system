The Central Committee of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) that met today decided to appoint a new set of office-bearers on June 3 as part of measures taken to reform the party, it is learnt.

The party’s key decision making bodies-the All Island Committee, the Executive Committee and the Central Committee-will meet in June to finalise these appointments.
