The All Island Bakers’ Association (AIBA) today warned that prices of all bakery products except for bread would be increased within the next few days because of the increase in the price of ingredients.

The AIBA Chairman N.K. Jayawardane said ingredients such as margarine, palm oil, flour and sugar have gone up in price.

“If the prices of ingredients continue to increase, the prices of the bakery products will also increase. However, we are still to take a final decision,” he said and added that the government had increased the tax on margarine and palm oil. “We have to pay about Rs.185 for a kilogram of margarine and Rs.120 for a litre of palm oil only as tax. We hope the government will intervene in reducing the taxes at least on essential ingredients,” he said.(Darshana Sanjeewa)
