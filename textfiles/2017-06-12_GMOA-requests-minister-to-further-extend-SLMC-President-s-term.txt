The Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) today urged Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne to extend the term of Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) President Prof. Carlo Fonseka for a further five years.

Addressing a media briefing, GMOA Assistant Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said Prof. Fonseka’s term ended last December and it has been extended for a further 6 months ending on June 30.

“According to the SLMC constitution, the Health Minister has the power to extend the term or to appoint another to the presidency. Prof. Fonseka has served the SLMC and fought to safeguard medical education during his tenure,” he said,

Dr. Aluthge said political henchmen interested in the position are waiting to snatch the position however, the future of the medical education cannot rely on them.

Further he said the Indian Medical Council President has also been accused of corruption and a bribery case has been filed against him.

Therefore Dr. Aluthge said without extending Prof. Fonseka’s term for another six months, the minister should extend and create an environment to work with him for another five years. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
