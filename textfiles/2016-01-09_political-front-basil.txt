Former Economic Development Minister Basil Rajapaksa said yesterday there was an urgent to form a new political front in the country.
Mr. Rajapaksa, who served as a key minister in former President Mahinda Rajapaksa’s Cabinet said the main opposition had voted in favour of the 2016 budget though it was against the people's aspirations.
“There is no actual opposition in Parliament. So, the need for a new political front is badly felt. Even those who supported the United National Party (UNP) and Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna(JVP) are now disillusioned,” he said.(Kelum Bandara)
