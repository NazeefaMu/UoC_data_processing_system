Ringing in the festive season could not be more exciting this year, as HSBC unveils a special seasonal campaign to evoke the child in their cardholders from 15 November until 31 December 2016.
Overarching on the theme of ‘Bring out the child in you, today’, HSBC credit cardholders are sure to be spoiled for choice with seasonal offers across a wide range of shopping categories at some of the biggest retailers in the country.
 As part of the seasonal festivities during the busiest time of the year, HSBC will join key merchants to afford both early shoppers and last minute buyers the chance to bag in some big discounts when they shop throughout the holiday season. They cover fashion and retail, supermarket, household, dining, local and overseas holidays, jewellery and wrist watches, salons, spas and gyms, insurance, TV, devices, broadband and auto care.
Cardholders can look their best at every occasion with the latest designer labels in women’s, men’s and kid’s wear, footwear and accessories, complimented with up to 30 percent savings on every purchase at Softlogic retail stores. They can choose from designer brand names like Charles and Keith, Dockers, Fossil, Giordano, Levis, Mango, Mothercare, Nike, Pepe, Peter England and other international brands that are now available in Sri Lanka.
In addition, special super weekends that offer up to 50 percent savings will take place at Odel, Hameedia, Leather Collection, Cotton Collection and Cotton Collection Plus, Beverly Street, Alankara, Colombo Jewellery Stores, Bullion Exchange, Mallika Hemachandra Jewellers, Vogue Jewellers and Swarna Mahal on specific days of the month, leading up to Christmas.
Nilantha Bastian, Head of Retail Banking and Wealth Management stated, “The festive season is the most wonderful time of the year for most our customers. It can also be the most expensive with gift giving, attending to family re-unions and various holiday activities. As a child, the season would bring great joy and happiness as it meant opening up presents and sharing the laughter with loved ones. Thus, we wanted to recreate the same sentiment this year by evoking the child in our customers throughout the season. We have also lined up an exciting range of holiday offers for HSBC Premier and Advance customers. We hope all our customers will truly experience the inner joy and feel content being able to buy what they like and celebrate this special time with their friends and loved ones.”
