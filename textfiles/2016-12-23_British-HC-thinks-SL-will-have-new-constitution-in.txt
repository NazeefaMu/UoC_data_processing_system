British High Commissioner James Dauris said today he ‘thinks’ that the majority of Sri Lankans will be looking forward to having a new Constitution in 2017, “One that will help create the right framework for really good long-term community relations.”

In a Christmas and New Year message, he said “The majority of Sri Lankans will, I think, be looking forward to having in 2017 a new Constitution, one that will help create the right framework for really good long-term community relations. They will be keen to see more advances towards reconciliation.”

“As 2016 comes to an end it’s a good time to take a moment to reflect on some of the things that Sri Lanka and the UK have done together and achieved over the past twelve months. And as we all look forward to the start of the new year, it’s worth taking a moment to reflect on the opportunities and challenges 2017 will bring for our two countries, and on what will be important to us and what we would like to achieve in the months ahead,” Mr. Darius said.

Highlighting the assistance given to Sri Lanka in various fields, he said, “We share the welcome given by people in every community in Sri Lanka to the many positive steps taken over the year to help achieve and advance reconciliation between communities. With reconciliation will come the confidence and trust that will help to bring sustained and enduring peace and prosperity to Sri Lanka and Sri Lankans.”

He said it was not only the government that had taken the lead, but Parliament, regional and local authorities, religious leaders, civil society groups of all sorts and everyday people working together to bring about good outcomes.
