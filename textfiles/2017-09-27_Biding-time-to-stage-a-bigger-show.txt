Biding time to stage a bigger show!


	



The Amendment allegedly designed as a ruse to postpone the provincial polls raised much sound and fury and finally ended as a damp squib. 


According to informed sources the names of four prominent figures on the government side had been mentioned in the lobby talk as among those who had vowed to vote against the Amendment if it were presented in the council. Three of this foursome made a major contribution towards the effort to usher in the yahapalanaya government.  One of them is a minority community leader representing a distant part in the country. The other two hailing from the Colombo district are conspicuous by their nationalist fervor. The fourth one is from the Gampaha district. Meanwhile, three others had pledged their support to the rebellious foursome. 


Although the circumstances intervened to preempt their big move, the foursome had decided to take yahapalanaya by surprise in a bigger way in the immediate future, sources say.
