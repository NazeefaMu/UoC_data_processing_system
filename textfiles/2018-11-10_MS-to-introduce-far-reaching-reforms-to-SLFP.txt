President Maithripala Sirisena is expected to introduce far reaching reforms to Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) giving him more powers over the party led by him.

The SLFP All Island Committee which met on Thursday has decided to appoint a politburo in addition to the Central Committee to decide on party matters .

It will consist of 15 members nominated by the President as the party leader. The SLFP has also decided to create a post of ‘Chief of Staff’ and appoint three separate secretaries to deal with international, trade union and legal affairs.

Party sources said the SLFP constitution would be amended to give legal effect to these changes with the President as the leader being given the power to sack anyone from the party when switching allegiance to another party. (Kelum Bandara)
