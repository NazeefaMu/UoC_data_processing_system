	The Naval Escort Task Group 19th held an open ship tour and luncheon onboard for the Korean expatriates, who participated in the welcoming ceremony.
	The Commander and the ship's Staff Officers also paid a courtesy call on Commander of Sri Lanka Navy, Vice Admiral Ravindra C. Wijegunaratne and Commander, Western Naval Area, Rear Admiral Jayantha De Silva at the Naval Headquarters.
