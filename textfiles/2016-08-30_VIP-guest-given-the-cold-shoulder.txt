A leading purohita from the West who was among those hosted to lunch by a colleague from the South at his residence recently had been denied a facility to re-charge his mobile phone. 

 


All Blue and Green politicians who attended the recent public rally held in Matara to celebrate the first anniversary of the yahapalanaya government had been hosted to lunch by the purohita from the South.


The purohita from the West who had arrived at the residence of the Southern colleague ahead of others had moved round the house looking for a plug-point to recharge his mobile phone, but none of the inmates had come forward to help him. Finally, he had to use the cell-charging facility in his vehicle, they say.
