Dual citizenship: Udaya asks Immigration Dept. for MPs details


	

Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) General Secretary and MP, Udaya Gammanpila today requested the Controller of Immigration and Emigration to furnish the details of the parliamentarians who held dual citizenship.

He had attached a list of MPs in his letter to the Controller asking whether any of them were dual citizens as at August 17, 2015.

“When applying for a passport, the applicant has to mention whether he is a dual citizen. The MPs' passport and identity card numbers could be obtained from Parliament,” Mr. Gammanpila said and added that the people had a right to know whether there were any MPs who were disqualified from holding that title.

He said he is submitting the letter based on the Right to Information (RTI) Act and that withholding of information or providing false information were punishable offences according to Clause 39 of the Act.

The Court of Appeal last Wednesday ruled that Galle District MP Geetha Kumarasinghe was disqualified from functioning as an MP as she held dual citizenship in Sri Lanka and Switzerland. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
