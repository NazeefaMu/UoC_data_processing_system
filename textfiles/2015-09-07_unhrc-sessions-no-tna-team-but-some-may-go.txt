The Tamil National Alliance (TNA) said today it had not decided to send a party delegation to attend the upcoming United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) sessions.
Its spokesperson and MP M.A. Sumanthiran while confirming this to the Daily Mirror however said some members might go in their individual capacities.
He was responding to a query about some TNA members of the Northern Provincial Council deciding to go to Geneva during the UNHRC sessions to lobby for an international probe.
"I also heard about it in the media. Individual members may go . But the TNA, as a party, has not decided to go," he said. (Kelum Bandara)
