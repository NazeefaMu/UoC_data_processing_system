Former Galle District UPFA parliamentarian Geetha Kumarasinghe today submitted documents to the Elections Commission (EC) Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya confirming the renunciation of her Swiss citizenship, which disqualified her from being elected as an MP.

 Speaking to the media at the Commission, she said that she was now eligible to contest the upcoming general election.

“I will definitely contest at the parliamentary election. I renounced the citizenship in Switzerland amidst mounting pressure from my family. I did all of this for the best interest of the people in the Galle district,” Ms. Kumarasinghe said. (Sheain Fernandopulle)
