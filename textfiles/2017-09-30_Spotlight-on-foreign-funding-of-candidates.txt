People’s Action for Free and Fair Elections (PAFFREL) has stressed the need to include provisions in the proposed campaign finance law to monitor transnational funding to political parties during elections.

It has submitted proposals to be included in the campaign finance law which would govern the finances of candidates during election campaigning. PAFFREL Executive Director Rohana Hettiarachchi told Daily Mirror the enacting of the proposed legislation would make it necessary for each candidate to maintain separate accounts for campaign financing.

“All donations from well-wishers or any other source should be channelled through this account,” he said. (Kelum Bandara)
