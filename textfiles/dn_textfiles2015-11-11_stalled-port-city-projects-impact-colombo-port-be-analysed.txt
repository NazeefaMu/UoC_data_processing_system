Stalled Port City project's impact on Colombo Port to be analysed

The Ports and Shipping Ministry plans to analyse the impact on the Colombo Port owing to the initial construction of the Port City Project which is at a stand still now.
Ports and Shipping Minister Arjuna Ranatunga said they had requested the Megapolis and Western Development Ministry for a feasibility study aiming to determine the impact to the Colombo port since the Port City project comes under the purview of the Megapolis Ministry.
A huge quantum of sea sand has been used for the initial construction of the Port City Project. There is a vulnerability of the sand dunes being washed away to the Colombo Port basin causing a severe impact on the smooth functioning of the port after the project was halted with the political change earlier this year.
"Sand used during the initial stages of construction of the Port City Project to reclaim the sea may wash into the port basin. Therefore, we requested a feasibility study to determine the effects of the Port City Project on Colombo Port," Ranatunga said. The construction company of the Port City Project has taken precautionary measures to prevent the sand being washed away by using a metal cover around sand dunes. However, instead of those temporary measures, there is a possibility that the sand would obstruct the shipping routes and the functions of the jetty, he said.
