Govt. advt. calls for uni students to follow right path


	

The government in a newspaper advertisement yesterday made an appeal to all university students to attend all lectures and focus on their studies by following the right path to success without wasting their time by protesting on the streets.

The Presidential Secretariat, Higher Education Ministry and the Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Ministry had jointly made this appeal to university students.

“We often see university students wasting their time protesting on our roads: exposed to the weather and tear gas. They chant slogans written by somebody else on matters they don’t fully understand. Their behaviour causes massive traffic jams affecting millions. What a waste of time all around,” the advertisement said.

It also questioned why university students allowed themselves to be used as scapegoats by political opportunists.

It said the hard working parents had supported their children to learn, graduate and become productive citizens and not to go astray like this.

“The government spends millions to produce each medical doctor. Students who miss their lectures to take part in demonstrations are squandering taxpayers' money and their own futures. They also become a public nuisance,” it said in the advertisement.

It said that the government wanted to equip its youth with quality education to meet tomorrow’s challenges and a responsible government had to make decisions with all citizens’ interests in mind and take the broader view on higher education.

“Don’t idle on the roads! Take the right path to success,” it added.
