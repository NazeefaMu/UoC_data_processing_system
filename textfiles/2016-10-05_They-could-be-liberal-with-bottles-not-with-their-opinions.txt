They could be liberal with bottles, not with their opinions


	



 

Seniors of the Blue party faction that decided to contest the future elections under the ‘Hand’ symbol had recently met at the residence of the Betel leaf secretarial one to discuss their political future.

 

After emptying a number of bottles which helped them somewhat to loosen their tongues, the seniors had freely spoken out their minds on issues plaguing the party.


When one of them referred to the formidable challenge posed to them by the JP group, several others had pointed out the need to remove the thorns on their own side first. At this stage, a senior from the Colombo district had said: “That garrulous duo is a real threat to the unity of the party. They send hundreds of party supporters into the arms of the JO group every time they open their gab.”


“That’s quite true. They have become a real liability to the party,” another party veteran readily agreed.


“Whom are you referring to?” a party stalwart from Uva asked. 


When the names were mentioned an uneasy silence ensued.
