Telecommunication and Digital Technology Minister Harin Fernando apologised in Parliament today over the use of obscene language against Joint Opposition MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage.

Making a statement, he assured such behaviour would not be repeated hereafter. Mr. Fernando said his use of unparliamentary words was a spontaneous reaction to provocation by the other side, and he had noted some even ridiculed the Speaker calling him 'Patholaya'.

Also, he said he regretted what happened, and would bow down to any action by the Speaker.
The Speaker said he appreciated the Minister making a public apology.

"As a politician, you admitted your guilt. It will serve as a blessing for you in future," he said. (Kelum Bandara and Yohan Perera)
