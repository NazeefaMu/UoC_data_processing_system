The CID told a Colombo Magistrate today that their investigations into an incident of abduction of several persons by unidentified groups in Colombo and the surrounding areas in 2009 had revealed that former Western Province DIG Anura Senanayake had prevented the CCD from arresting former Navy Lieutenant Commander Sampath Dayananda

The CID said they would record a statement from Mr. Senanayake at the prison premises on February 28 over this allegation.

The CID said that the then CCD DIG Nuwan Wedisinghe had enlightened that when the CCD wanted to arrest Dayananda for the abductions, DIG Anura Senanayake had prevented them from doing so..

The CID also said that even though they had asked Mr. Dayananda to come to the CID to record his statement he is absconding the CID by alleging that he is under going training in an unknown destination. However the CID had given him two weeks time to come to the CID to record his statement.

The OIC of the CID’s Gang Robbery Unit-Inspector Nishantha Silva had informed Court that former Navy Intelligence Director Ananda Guruge and Lieutenant Commander Sampath Dayananda, attached to the Welisara Navy camp would be arrested with regard to the abductions and disappearances of Vadivelu Pakkili Sami Loganathan and Rathnasami Paramanandan.

Meanwhile, , Navy Intelligence officer Lieutenant Commander Dhammika Anil Mapa attached to the Welisara Navy camp was arrested for allegedly abducting Vadivelu Pakkili Sami Loganathan on November 1, 2009 and was yesterday further remanded till March 9.

Inspector Nishantha Silva had nformed Court that the van of Vadivelu Pakkili Sami Loganathan was found at the Welisara Navy Camp cut into 72 pieces.

However, President’s Counsel Anil Silva defending the suspect had denied allegations levelled against his client but admitted the fact that the Navy Intelligence Unit had taken the vehicle into their custody following a report that it contained bombs concealed and the Navy was compelled to cut into pieces for the purpose of searching explosive substances.

The CID said there was no legal provision vested with the Navy to carry out such a step and the Navy should have brought the matter to the attention of police and to the bomb disposal unit.(T.Farook Thajudeen)
