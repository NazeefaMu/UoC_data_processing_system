Former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa said yesterday that he had not been officially informed about replacing his military security with police personnel.


However, he said he had requested the current Defence Secretary to inform relevant authorities not to replace his military security.


"There are still threats to our lives because of the measures we took to eradicate Terrorism from the island. Therefore, I request not to replace the security provided to me," he told the journalists outside, Colombo Special High court.
