DPA, 07th MAY, 2017-  Investigators have discovered Nazi memorabilia in German army barracks, adding a dark twist to the Bundeswehr’s ongoing investigation into suspected far-right sympathizers among its ranks.  


A display case containing steel helmets dating back to the Wehrmacht of World War II was found at barracks in the Black Forest town of Donaueschingen following a tip-off, news magazine Spiegel reported on Saturday.   Inspectors also discovered on Thursday a room decorated with Wehrmacht memorabilia, according to the report. Pictures were handed to the Defence Ministry as evidence.  


The Spiegel report was confirmed to dpa by a ministry spokesman, who added that the items were not considered “of criminal relevance.”
