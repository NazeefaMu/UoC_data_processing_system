A top cop, who was on vacation leave has gone missing following a complaint that he had defrauded a sum of Rs.4 million. 

 


A posse of police sleuths is now combing the central hills in search of the missing high-up. 


The subordinates of the high-up who had been getting a rough deal from him are highly elated over the much-hated boss’ sudden exit from the scene. The happiest of them all is a certain ‘lion’ who is going to be the immediate beneficiary of the boss’ downfall.
