Police will not hesitate to shoot anyone who attempts to loot ballot boxes or act in a manner that will obstruct the holding of a free and fair election, Police spokesman Ruwan Gunasekara said.

He said security had been tightened in and around polling and counting centres and reinforcements would be available in case of an emergency.

SP Gunasekera said the Special Task Force (STF) and the Civil Defence Force (CDF) have deployed some 3,000 mobile patrols to prevent any violence will be on duty until Sunday evening to prevent post-election violence.

He said anyone including media personnel attempting to photograph the polling stations and counting centres or their vicinity without prior permission of the Elections Commission would be arrested.

The SP said media heads had been informed of the guidelines set by the EC and as such the law would be strictly enforced against miscreants.

He warned candidates and supporters to refrain from entering polling and counting centres under the influence of liquor or drugs. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
