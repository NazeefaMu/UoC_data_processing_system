Shaminda Eranga’s bowling action found to be illegal: ICC


	

The International Cricket Council today announced that an independent assessment has found the bowling action of Sri Lanka’s Shaminda Eranga to be illegal and, as such, the fast bowler has been suspended from bowling in international cricket with immediate effect.
 
The assessment revealed that all deliveries exceeded the 15 degrees level of tolerance permitted under the regulations.
 
Eranga was reported after the second Test against England at Chester-le-Street on 31 May 2016.
 
In accordance with Article 6.1 of the regulations, Eranga’s international suspension will also be recognised and enforced by all National Cricket Federations for domestic cricket events played in their own jurisdiction, save that, with the consent of Sri Lanka Cricket, Eranga may be able to play in domestic cricket events played in Sri Lanka under the auspices of Sri Lanka Cricket.
 
The player can apply for a re-assessment after modifying his bowling action in accordance with clause 2.4 of the Regulations for the Review of Bowlers Reported with Suspected Illegal Bowling Actions.
 
The test was performed on 6 June at the National Cricket Performance Centre in Loughborough, which is an ICC accredited testing centre.
