Appointing me as PM will complicate things further-Sajith


	

UNP Deputy Leader Sajith Premadasa yesterday said the present crisis would become complicated if he was appointed Prime Minister.

“There are two Prime Ministers already and if a third is appointed things would become more complicated,” Mr. Premadasa said in response to a question raised by journalists at the Parliamentary complex last afternoon. Later, responding to the same question asked during a media briefing he said one must not believe every story that is being planted in the media.

Mr. Premadasa who also commented on yesterday’s ugly incidents in Parliament said what was experienced was a conflict between state terrorism and democracy.
He said the people who created a pandemonium in the House are also capable of creating a similar situation during an election. “Won’t these people who invaded the Speaker’s chair yesterday invade polling booths during an election?” he questioned.
