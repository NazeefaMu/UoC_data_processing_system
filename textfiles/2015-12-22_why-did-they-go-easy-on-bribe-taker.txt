Why did they go easy on bribe taker?


	

An instance where authorities had soft-pedalled an open and shut case of bribery has been reported from a key state corporation recently.
In this case, a young girl had called at a key state corporation to meet a high political authority. A security guard at the corporation who accosted the girl had inquired the purpose of her visit.  She had named a certain political authority adding that she wanted to see him regarding securing a job.
The security guard who soon won the girl’s confidence had told her in a conspiratorial tone that he being an intimate of the political authority was in a position to help her, but he had to oil the palm of certain officials involved. Later the girl had given Rs.20,000 to the security guard who had promised to see that she would get the letter of appointment within a few days.
The girl had waited several days for the letter of appointment but in vain and realizing that something had gone wrong, she had called on the political authority to inquire about the delay.
On hearing the girl’s story about her encounter with the security guard and the rest of it, the political authority had immediately sent for him and reprimanded him in the girl’s presence. 
However, the corporation employees express their surprise that the case has been closed after transferring the security guard to a sub-station of the state corporation.
