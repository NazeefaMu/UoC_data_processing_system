SLTB case: Susil Premajayantha and Anura Priyadarshana Yapa released


	

The Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) today moved the Colombo Commercial High Court to release the two respondents Susil Premajayantha and Anura Priyadarshana Yapa, (members of the 2015 - UPFA presidential election committee) from the case filed against them for the recovery of Rs 143 million due to the SLTB for hiring buses for the meetings of presidential candidate Mahinda Rajapaksa.

The Counsel for the plaintiff, while moving to release the two respondents from the case, further amended the plaint against five respondents, including former president Mahinda Rajapaksa and chief of staff of the former president Gamini Senarath, for the recovery of Rs 143 million.

Commercial High Court Judge Shiran Gunaratne had earlier, on a request made by the Counsel for the SLTB, allowed him to amend the plaint since the plaintiff wanted to amend several names of defendants cited in the plaint.

Commercial High Court Judge Shiran Gunaratne ordered the respondents to file objections on November 22.

The SLTB had earlier named seven UPFA 2015- presidential election committee members, including former president Mahinda Rajapaksa, the former UPFA general secretary Susil Premajayantha, former SLFP general secretary Anura Priyadarshana Yapa and election committee member Gamini Senarath, as respondents for the petition.
