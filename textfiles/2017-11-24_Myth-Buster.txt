MYTH: You should take antibiotics to stop diarrhea  

BUSTED: “The majority of diarrhea is caused by viruses. Antibiotics are medications that fight infections caused by bacteria. Unless when you see blood along with the diarrhea, that may be an implication that it is caused by bacteria. It can actually make the diarrhea worse by killing off the good bacteria. So what we give is probiotics. Diarrhea is also a protective mechanism that flushes the system which is why you shouldn’t prescribe antibiotics. When experiencing diarrhea you must give ‘jeevani’ in order to avoid dehydration,” explained Dr. Kosala Karunaratne, Consultant Paediatrician, Lady Ridgeway Hospital,Colombo, ETU
