Allegations against ex-navy spokesman D.K.P. Dassanayake are baseless, Pivithuru  Hela Urumaya General Secretary, Udaya Gammanpila said today.

He told a news conference that Commodore Dassanayake was not involved in the abduction and disappearance of 11 youth and the statements made by Police Media Spokesman Ruwan Gunasekara with regard to the allegations were false and baseless.

"I challenge the police media spokesman to an open debate so that I could prove who should be arrested over the allegations made against Commodore Dassanayake," Mr. Gammanpila said.

He said a war hero should not be held responsible so-called abductions and disappearances.

"We are not in a position to defend the accused but we are keen to see that justice is meted out and provide evidence against those who should be arrested," Mr. Gammanpila said. (Sheain Fernandopulle)
