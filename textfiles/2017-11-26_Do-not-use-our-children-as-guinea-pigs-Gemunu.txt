The SAITM Medical Faculty Parents Forum’s Convener Gemunu Wijeratne today urged the committee to investigate SAITM matter headed by Deputy Minister Dr. Harsha De Silva not to use their children as guinea pigs.

In a joint press briefing held with the Medical Faculty Students' Parents Association (MFSPA) Mr. Wijeratne charged that the committee is allegedly attempting to mislead them by converting the institute to a different entity without abolishing it.

He accused that the deputy minister is experimenting to legalize the private medical institutes using the SAITM students without resolving the matter therefore they don’t have faith on the committee.

He also said SAITM was established without any legal framework and it would take ages to legalize private medical institutes even as a different entity.  Therefore he  urged the government to enroll the SAITM students to the state medical faculties immediately.

“ We cannot wait for some more years. We request the authorities to appoint an independent professional committee comprising  deans of the medical faculties to resolve this issue.” he said.

When contacted Chairman of the committee Dr. Harsha de Silva said that Dr. Tennakoon has been appointed on behalf of the SAITM Parents Association therefore he cannot comment on Mr. Wijeratne’s statement.

“I’m totally independent on this matter. I cannot talk to each parent of the SAITM. If Mr. Wijeratne want to take part in the committee let him do so,” deputy minister said. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
