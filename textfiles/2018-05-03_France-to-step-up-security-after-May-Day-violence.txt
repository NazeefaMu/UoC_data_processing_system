REUTERS, 02nd MAY, 2018- France will increase police numbers for the next round of protests over economic reforms after violent clashes marred the annual May Day rally in Paris, interior minister Gerard Collomb said on Wednesday.


Police said 109 people had been held in custody after Tuesday’s clashes, when masked and hooded anarchists hijacked the traditional May 1 rally held by labor unions, smashing shop windows and torching cars in parts of Paris.


Further demonstrations are planned later this week, in protest against economic reform plans by French President Emmanuel Macron.


“There will be an even greater number of security forces ... who will aim to separate those who wish to demonstrate from those who wish to vandalize,” Collomb told France 2 television on Wednesday.


Collomb defended how the police had handled the demonstration on Tuesday, although opposition politicians criticized the government for not having done enough to prevent the violence.
