The Colombo Fort Magistrate today upheld that the incorporation of the Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID) was legal and within the legal powers vested in the Inspector General of Police (IGP).

Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne also rejected legal objections raised by the Counsel appearing for former Minister Wimal Weerawansa's brother Sarath and NFF MP Jayantha Samaraweera, over the legality of establishing the FCID.

The Magistrate observed that there was no obstacle that impeded the FCID from carrying out its investigations.

Earlier, appearing for the suspects, defence counsel moved a written legal objection that the FCID had no jurisdiction or legal power to file cases in Magistrate's Courts since it was not incorporated as a Police Station but only a division by the IGP in contradiction the Criminal Procedure Code.
