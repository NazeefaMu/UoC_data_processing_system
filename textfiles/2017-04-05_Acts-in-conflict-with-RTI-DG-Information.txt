A total of 110 Acts had been found to be contradicting with the Right to Information Act when the RTI was implemented, Government Information Department's Director General Ranga Kalansooriya said today.

He said the identified 110 Acts should have to be amended to some extend to be compatible with the RTI Act.

“Following the instructions of the Minister Rajitha Senaratne, we conducted an investigation regarding the RTI and we have identified 110 such Acts,” he said.

The intention of the people seems to have increased over the RTI Act and they are getting used to use their right,” Mass Media Minister Gayantha Karunathilaka said speaking at the Cabinet briefing.

He said the RTI Act was fully operative from February 3rd enabling people to obtain any information from the Government.

The Minister had formed a special unit to identify and sort out many problems that had cropped up while implementing the RTI, he said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)
