Hemas Hospitals partner Credence Genomics to offer cutting edge genetic diagnostics

Hemas Hospital laboratory services entered into a collaboration with Credence Genomics, the pioneer in genomic research and diagnostics in Sri Lanka.
The collaboration allows Hemas hospitals to offer high end molecular biology and genetic tests that have been developed by Credence Genomics for diagnosis of infectious diseases, tumour treatment, breast and colorectal cancer predictions and a range of inherited genetic disorders.
The infection detection test could within 24 hours detect the infection, whether it is bacteria or a fungi. A further set of tests can then identify exactly which bacteria or fungi is affecting the patient.
This is a culture independent highly sensitive test, which even gives the relative abundance of the microbes.
With respect to cancer diagnostics, the 'Tumor Hotspot analysis ', tests for common cancer genes in one go and assists in the fine-tuning of chemotherapy to minimise side effects.
Hemas Hospital is a subsidiary of Hemas Group, a leading Sri Lankan conglomerate that has business interests in four key sectors - FMCG, Health care, Transportation and Leisure.
The multi-specialty hospital chain comprises 3 full-service hospitals at Wattala, Galle and Thalawathugoda, along with 33 fully equipped laboratories and provides community-based expert health care services by positioning its chain of hospitals in strategic locations outside the commercial hub of Colombo.
