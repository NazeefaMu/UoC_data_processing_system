A Bangladeshi man dubbed the 'tree man' because of the bark-like warts on his body has undergone treatment that doctors hope may have cured him of his condition.

Abul Bajandar has had at least 16 operations to remove 11 lbs of growths from his hands and feet since his condition came to doctors' attention a year ago.

The 27-year-old former rickshaw driver is one of only four people in the world ever to be diagnosed with epidermodysplasia verruciformis, an extremely rare genetic condition dubbed 'tree-man disease' that left him unable to hold his three-year-old daughter. (Daily Mail)
