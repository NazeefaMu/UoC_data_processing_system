The Elvis Presley Fan Club of Sri Lanka has sent us news of Elvis’ latest Christmas CD, with orchestration by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, the third such philharmonic-backed album.
Club President Jayaratne Perera has included a quote by Prescilla Presley, taken from the accompanying booklet. She says:
“It was snowing in Bad Nauheim, Germany, this particular night I was with Elvis. We were sitting in the sitting room at the house he rented while serving in the US army stationed in Germany. He got up from his chair, took my hand and led me to the window. He said in a sentimental tone, “Look at all that snow, it reminds me of Christmas at Graceland. Of all the holidays, it’s my favourite time of the year. We would have family members, friends to celebrate. The tree would be in the living room loaded with gifts. I have a Santa and Reindeer decoration scene out in front so everyone that drove by Graceland could see it from the highway. For next year, I want to have more colourful lights out front to make it even more festive. I want you to come visit me at Graceland sometime and see for yourself how beautiful it is.’
“Standing next to him at that moment I could have never guessed that these words would come true years later. But there I was, experiencing every word he described of what Christmas was like.”
