May Day brings City to a standstill


	

Colombo appears deserted with public transport at a standstill because of the several May Day processions and rallies which took over the City today.

The public transport was disrupted as a result of the various political parties hiring buses from the Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) the the private bus operators.

The Police assisted by the Special Task Forces (STF) personnel were deployed to maintain law and order and prevent any untoward incidents by overly enthusiastic supporters.

Meanwhile, people who had to visit Colombo for work or some other purposes found themselves handicapped without transport.

Several minor incidents were reported from some of the May Day rallies with many of the party supporters being under the influence of liquor. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
