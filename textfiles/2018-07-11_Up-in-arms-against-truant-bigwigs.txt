Up in arms against  truant bigwigs!


	



 

There is a steep drop in the attendance of purohitas at the Green party’s Diyawanna group meeting these days, they say.

 


Even the party’s group meeting held last week saw the presence of only five members from the top team.


The Green backbenchers have got highly worked up over the top team members making it a practice to keep away from the group meetings as this is the forum available to them to air their grievances and ask questions about the shortcomings relating to Ministries. 


The irate backbenchers have also made a complaint to the party boss against the truant purohitas and warned that they may have to take to the streets to voice their problems if the purohitas fail to attend the group meetings to give them a hearing.
