The operations of Galaha Divisional Hospital had been suspended because of the damages caused to the hospital after it was attacked by an angry mob yesterday in the wake of the death of a child in the hospital, Provincial Director of Health Services (PDHS) for Central Province Dr Shanthi Samarasinghe said today.

Dr Samarasinghe told the Daily Mirror that two medical officers attached to the Galaha Divisional Hospital had been transferred to the Provincial Directors’ Office temporarily following the protests by residents.

“No doctor is prepared to go there at the moment for the hospital. The hospital has also been largely damaged due to the attack.

“No medical officer is ready to take on duties because of the tense situation followed by the child’s death,” she said.

She also said a team had been sent to the hospital yesterday in to determine the nature of the damages.

Meanwhile, the Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) yesterday urged Inspector General of Police Pujith Jayasundera to conduct an impartial investigation into the incident and to immediately arrest the suspects involved in the attack.

GMOA Assistant Secretary Dr Naveen de Soyza told a news conference that the doctor, who treated said the child had been obstructed from performing his duties by the relatives of the child.

He said the other Registered Medical Practitioner had engaged at the clinic at that time.

“When the only doctor who was available at the hospital had started treating the child, another two women in critical condition were admitted following a road accident.

“The doctor has treated them and sent them to the Peradeniya Teaching Hospital by the only ambulance at the Galaha Divisional Hospital,” he said.

“The doctor attended to the child again and had made arrangements to get an Ambulance from the Deltota Hospital to send the child to Peradeniya.

“Then, the relatives of the child have turned violent and attacked the doctor as well as the property,” he added.

He said there were around 200 hospitals across the country with only one doctor, similar to the Galaha Hospital.

He said that the situation would be more critical if people behave so during emergencies. (Kalathma Jayawardhane and Suranga Rajanayake)
