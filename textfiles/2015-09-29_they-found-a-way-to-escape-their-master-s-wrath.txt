They found a way to escape their Master’s wrath!


	


This new Ministerial one held a similar post in the previous regime as well. The very day he assumed duties, he had ordered the head of his private staff to arrange his lunch at the Ministry itself. 
He had also given the aides the menu for his lunch and ordered that in addition to the other delicacies, there should be a ‘Tebu-leaf sambol’ as a must. The Ministerial one, a diabetic, had decided to take ‘Tebu-leaf’, which is said to be an effective herbal medicine for the disease as part of his mid-day meal, they say. 
One day it was raining cats and dogs and the aides were not able to find Tebu leaves for the routine sambol for their boss.
The Ministerial one who sat down to lunch that day quickly noticed that the Tebu-leaf sambol dish was missing from the table laid out for him. And that got his goat. Disdaining the excuse his aides gave him, the Ministerial one raved at them for neglecting their duty, they say. The personal aides knew that incurring the wrath of the Ministerial one could lead to even loss of their jobs and they hit upon a plan to ensure an uninterrupted supply of Tebu leaves -- to raise a Tebu crop in the Ministry premises!
