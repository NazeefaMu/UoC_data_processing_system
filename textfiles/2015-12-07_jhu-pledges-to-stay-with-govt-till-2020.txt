Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka yesterday averred that the Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU)’s support which was extended to President Maithripala Sirisena and the current coalition government would continue until 2020, even if the government had to face problems in the future.
He vowed not to let any so-called patriot to destroy the country’s image which was founded on democracy.
Delivering the main speech at the 12th convention of the JHU, at the ‘Ape Gama’ premises in Battaramulla, the minister, who is also the General Secretary of the JHU, said the government may have to face problems due to recently presented budget, problems from Geneva and other problems. But the JHU would continue to support the government and stay with it and face the problems.
He said that the intention of the JHU was to help build a professional political system which created national unity and was supported by all the political parties in the country.
“Even we have to change ourselves to change the country -- to build an atmosphere where all communities can live in peace and security. We should not change our objectives because some opponents are saying pointless things,” he said.
During the convention, a new board of officials was appointed to the JHU Colombo Group.
Several selected activists who had worked for the party were given recognition by being awarded souvenirs. (Piyumi Fonseka)
