However, the government decided at a meeting yesterday to shelve the enactment.

Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said the Bill would be amended further .

"We will not enact it this week. We will do it at the next parliamentary week only," he said.

Meanwhile, the Supreme Court determination on the constitutionality of the bill will be communicated to the House today. (Kelum Bandara)
