Sports Minister Navin Dissanayake today asked former president Mahinda Rajapaksa to disclose whether it was the same “Gang of robbers” that would govern the country if he was elected prime minister again.
The minister said some MPs including himself quit the previous government as a means of expressing their protest at the incidence of fraud and corruption committed by some politicians during the previous regime.
 He said it was clear that Mr. Rajapaksa was carrying out his political campaign through falsehoods and deception. The minister said that Mr. Rajapaksa had even falsely claimed that 59 army camps in the North had been removed.
“We ask Mr. Rajapaksa to name even a single army camp that had been removed as claimed by him. We will not allow any such thing to happen. As a veteran politician he should not make such blatantly false statements,” the minister said.
He said the former president had not made any statement regarding the allegations made against him including those of having misused state vehicles, palatial houses built in several parts of the country and the corruption involved in road construction projects.(Ajith Siriwardana)WATCH
