Chief Opposition Whip and JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake said yesterday the government was planning to hand over the Trincomalee oil tank farm to the Indian Oil Company (IOC) despite a Cabinet decision in 2016 to hand it over to the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation.

He told parliament that Cabinet approval had been obtained in August 7, 2018 to hand over 15 Lower Tank Farm to IOC and to hand over 85 of the Upper Tank Farm to a joint venture by the IOC and Ceypetco.

The MP said Cabinet approval was granted to develop 16 Tanks with funds from Ceypetco on June, 6, 2016 and that it had the needed US$10 million required for the purpose.

He asked on what basis was the oil tank farm being handed over to the IOC when it could be developed by Ceypetco and pointed out in COPE the developing the tank farm would provide access to the international oil market and that it would be a lucrative foreign currency earner.

Neither the subject minister nor the deputy minister was in the House to answer the question and House Leader Lakshman Kiriella assured that the answer would be given at the next parliament day. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)
