A jump from the bench to a political seat?


	



 

Reports from the North say that an ‘arbiter’ occupying a high chair in the administration of justice is planning to take to politics in a big way following in the footsteps of a political bigwig in the same province and with the latter’s blessings.

 


The arbiter’s planned advent to politics had been the subject of discussion at a rendezvous held recently behind closed doors. A certain legal eagle who once held high office in the State legal sector and later functioned as an advisor to some militant outfits and also a political bigwig from the North had participated in the deliberations which revolved around sponsoring the arbiter’s debut in politics at the polls in the offing.
