Speaker Karu Jayasuriya today cautioned MPs both in the Government and in the Opposition about name-calling during proceedings.

He said he had noted down the names of the MPs who slandered each other during Wednesday's debate and told them such name-calling was un-parliamentary and violated the Standing Orders governing parliamentary business.

The Speaker said he would act sternly against such behaviour in keeping with Standing Orders to ensure decorum and dignity of the House.

The Speaker also cautioned opposition MPs who in an effort to be sarcastic made sounds similar to those made by animals to distract their political opponents.(Kelum Bandara and Yohan Perera)
