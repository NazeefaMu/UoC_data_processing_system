A yahapalana bigwig holding a leadership position in Diyawannawa who was highly agitated over the JO move to expose ‘corrupt top ten’ in the government spoke to the livewire behind the move. Both being politicos from the upcountry happen to be long standing pals.

 

The government bigwig asked the ‘top ten list’ author why they were making ‘baseless allegations’ against them.  The JO stalwart replied that they would not level a corruption charge against anyone without a reason. Thereupon, the government bigwig reassured the JO man that he would not go outside the book in carrying out the functions related to his subject.


The Top Ten List author had replied: “Whether you like it or not, you have to follow the book and we will see to that you do so…”


Thereafter, the ‘top ten’ in the government had put their thick heads to work out a plan to turn tables on the top ten list author, they say.
