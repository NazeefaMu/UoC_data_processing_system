The Minneriya and the Kaudulla National Parks were reopened for tourists this afternoon, the Department of Wildlife Conservation said.

The two parks were temporarily closed following a tense situation erupted between the fishermen of the area and the forest rangers Sunday evening. 

Meanwhile, Safari Jeep Operators held a protest this morning demanding the authorities to immediately reopen the park. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
