Four young Samaneras missing in jungle trip
	
A joint search operation was in progress by the police, army and the Special Task Force this evening when after four Samanera monks aged 11 to 13 years from a temple in Aralaganwila did not return after trekking into the jungle.
The four Samaneras attached to Danajaya Raja Maha Viharaya in Kandegama had reportedly left the temple around 11.00am yesterday while its chief incumbent was away.
The chief incumbent who returned to the Viharaya at about 6.00pm had learnt that the four novice monks aged 11, 12 and 13 were missing, Police Spokesman ASP Ruwan Gunasekara said.
The Thera had immediately informed the Police 119 Emergency Service about the missing Samaneras whilst the villagers also started looking for the young Bhikkhus.
SSP Polonnaruwa Division Laksiri Wijesena told the Daily Mirror the monks were believed to have entered a dense forest behind the Viharaya through jungle routes that would lead to a tall rock in the distance.
The peak of the rock which was known to have provided shelter to ancient hermits has also contains a maze of caves within.
The officials suspect whether the Samaneras have lost their way back where elephants and other wild animals were in abundance.
The SSP said several teams of Aralaganwila Police backed by an army and STF unit have launched a search operation with experienced villagers as guides on the jungle routes.
The search was in progress and no clue leading to the missing monks were established at the time this edition went to press last night. (Kurulu Koojana Kariyakarawana)

SL calls on remaining banned entities to renounce violence, separatism
	
Explaining the move to lift the ban on several earlier proscribed organisations and individuals, the foreign ministry today urged the remaining banned entities to make public commitments condemning violence and renouncing separatism in order for de-proscription of those entities.
By a gazette extraordinary issued on Friday, the government lifted the ban on several outfits and individuals previously thought to have been working for the LTTE. On March 21, 2014, 16 organizations and 424 individuals were proscribed under the UN Act No: 45 of 1968. But the latest gazette notification bans only eight organizations and 155 individuals.
We hope that other groups and individuals make similar public commitments condemning violence and renouncing separatism in addition to other necessary measures. Then they too can be considered for de-proscription and join other formerly proscribed organisations, both in the North and South, who have successfully entered the democratic mainstream and are now working for the betterment of Sri Lanka, the ministry said in a statement.
The initial proscription process was conducted in haste and was not subject to a rigorous process of assessment and verification. Many of the listed organisations had never condoned violence or terrorism. Some of the proscribed individuals were even dead at the time of proscription - including one individual who died 8 years prior to the proscription, the ministry said.
It also said that over the last six months, law enforcement and intelligence agencies have conducted a comprehensive and careful review of the proscribed organisations and individuals. The review process concluded that there was no intelligence or evidence justifying the listing of eight organisations and 267 persons, it said.
As a result of this review, our law enforcement and intelligence services are now able to target their resources more efficiently and focus their energy on genuine threats improving the security of all Sri Lankans. Furthermore, since the new Government came to power with a mandate for democracy, good governance, rule of law, accountability and reconciliation many listed groups made public statements expressing their commitment to a united, undivided Sri Lanka in global forums.
The statement also said that as per its legal obligations, the Government will annually review and update the list of proscribed persons.
