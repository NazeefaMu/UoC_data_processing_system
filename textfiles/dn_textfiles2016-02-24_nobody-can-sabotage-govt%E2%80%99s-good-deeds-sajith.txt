Nobody can sabotage govt’s good deeds - Sajith

The government will never let anyone to sabotage the good work it is carrying on, Housing and Construction Minister Sajith Premadasa said. He said that the opposition members who were defeated twice should find out their mistakes and extend their support for the good work of the government.
“But they just initiate atrocious conspiracies against the government by using various political slogans such as “Stop signing trade agreements,” he said. “Members of the joint opposition are attempting to revolt against the government which is engaged in providing benefits to one million youth. This gang will become the traitors to a million unemployed youth of the country,” he said.
