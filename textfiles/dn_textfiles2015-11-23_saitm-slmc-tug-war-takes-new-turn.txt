SAITM, SLMC tug-of-war takes new turn

The tug-of-war between the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM), country’s only private medical college and Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) took a new turn last week when the latter publicly announced that the medical degree issued by SAITM will not be recognised by them.
SAITM too issued a public reply to SLMC announcement. The Higher Education Ministry, Health Ministry and the University Grants Commission maintain deadly silence over the matter despite calls by students, professional bodies including Government Medical Officers’ Union for the authorities to intervene, while the future of close to 1,000 students hangs in balance.

Questions have also been raised regarding what the exact criteria of accepted standards for medical faculties’ to obtain SLMC approval. In the debate over SAITM, standards of some of the medical faculties in the state universities such as Rajarata University and Kotalawala Defence University are also being questioned now.
SAITM maintains that SLMC is duty bound to register the institution as it has been already recognised by the UGC and approved by the Higher Education Ministry claimed SAITM Chairman, Dr. Neville Fernando.
Next year students of SAITM plan to take matters to their own hands, Dr. Fernando explained.
“Each student will file a fundamental rights case against SLMC if they fail to register the students. They would not hesitate to go to courts to get registered,” he said alleging that SLMC is maintaining double standards in treating local private universities.
“SLMC registers foreign universities without proper guidelines whilst they impose all the regulations on SAITM”.
The UGC approved the medical degree offered by the SAITM in 2011 in a gazette notification issued on August 30, 2011. Later after powers of recognizing private degree awarding institutes were reassigned to the ‘Specified Authority’ or the Higher Education Ministry Secretary, SAITM was given degree awarding status again. However, there is a catch. In both gazettes a number of conditions have to be fulfilled by the institute for the degree to be recognised.
Stable investment was one, improving the library facilities was another, and most importantly “provide a commitment, which is continued and uninterrupted”, to make available “the facilities to be put in place relating to the conduct of clinical training by the faculty either at its own teaching hospitals or an agreement with any other teaching hospitals; improving clinical exposure for the students.” This is the same condition SLMC claims that the institute has not been fulfilled.
A team of experts appointed by SLMC visited SAITM on July 13, 14 and 15 on an inspection tour, with the intention of assessing the new private medical college prior to registering it with the SLMC.
This was done with the authority vested on the SLMC under section 19A of the Medical Ordinance, SLMC member Dr. Upul Gunersekara said. It was scheduled following a request made by SAITM Chairman, Dr. Neville Fernando.
“He wrote to inform that Dr. Neville Fernando Teaching Hospital (NFTH) had fulfilled all the conditions stipulated in the relevant gazette notification for due recognition,” Dr. Gunesekara explained.
According to the Medical Ordinance, the SLMC has powers to maintain the standards of medical education including standards relating to courses of study, examinations, staff, equipment, accommodation, training and facilities at the universities and other institutions which grant or confer any qualification allowing a person to obtain registration under the Medical Ordinance.
This was put in place to ensure that public receives safe and qualified medical care, from well-trained and skilled doctors, Dr. Gunesekara explained.
However, following the inspection, the team forwarded a report to the Health Minister recommending “that the degree awarded by the SAITM should not be recognised for the purpose of registration under the Medical Ordinance.”
This is not the first time the SLMC assessed the institution, the SLMC claims. “The SLMC along with the UGC visited SAITM in 2011. We assessed the documents which were submitted by the institution. The SLMC members were not satisfied with the UGC findings. But UGC ignored the views of SLMC and recognised them as a degree awarding institute,” Dr. Gunasekara explained.
Dr. Fernando maintains that the review committee was satisfied with the progress of the institution and they were willing to give the registration to the students.
It was an additional individual to the nine members chaired by Prof. Rizvi Sheriff who has an issue, he claims.
“The Professor came for the inspection late and he had a different view about the institution. He did not visit the premises nor did speak to the administration,” Dr. Fernando said.
He is confident about the report submitted by the nine member committee but suspects that the objections would have come from the additional member.
Contrary to Dr. Fernando's view, SLMC report observes several deficiencies in SAITM.
“The report points out the major issues, inadequacy of clinical exposure to trauma in surgery, common surgical and obstetrics and gynaecology emergencies as well as exposure to emergencies in adult medicine and paediatric care are lacking”.
The SLMC recognizes that SAITM has attempted to overcome this deficiency but at the time of inspection the measures taken had been insufficient to rectify this serious deficiency.
In a letter to the Health Minister forwarding the report, the SLMC states that “general inadequacy of clinical exposure in all the areas in terms of the number of case mix” to the medical students of SAITM “is of grave concern” while highlighting that “exposure to trauma in surgery, common surgical emergencies and obstetrics and gynaecology as well as exposure to emergencies in adult medicine and paediatric care are lacking”.
According to the SLMC, the medical faculty also lacks facilities “for training in practical clinical forensic medicine” and highlights a “deficiency in exposure to preventive care services in the state sector”.
SAITM is quick to defend their position on the matter stating that the students of the institute are given clinical practice in not only in their teaching hospitals but also at other private hospitals such as, Nawaloka Hospital, Asiri Hospital, Oasis Hospital and Nine Wells hospital.
The SLMC team of inspectors has raised concerns over the course of study provided, stating that it does not conform to the standards required by the SLMC. However, this course of study was approved earlier by the UGC and Ministry of Higher Education.
When accrediting a medical degree the SLMC follows a rigorous process, “first curriculum, course structure and criteria are evaluated by SLMC members, followed by a visit to the university in question. After the visit, the team will submit a report to the Council.
The decision will be taken considering the report submitted,” Dr. Gunasekera claimed.
SAITM is accredited to the Campus of Nizhny Novgorod State Medical Academy (NNSMA), a university in Russia. The University in Russia is approved by the SLMC. But a branch of that institution has to get the approval separately, he said.
GMOA concerned about the inadequacies highlighted by SAITM, appealed to President Maithripala Sirisena to appoint a Presidential Committee to investigate the matter.
“The government should take necessary measures for the students to gain the skills needed to practice in Sri Lanka,” GMOA Media Spokesperson, Dr. Navin De Soysa said.
Government should intervene, say students
The first batch of 25 students will graduate from the SAITM medical faculty in January 2016. Whether they will be able to practice as doctors in Sri Lanka remains uncertain in light of the current situation.

“I am disappointed by the progress of SLMC, even we want to pass out as good doctors,” claimed Dilshan Fernando, a final year a medical student at SAITM.
“We do not like to hinder the progress of the government hospitals but if there are deficiencies why cannot they guide us in the right manner?, he asks.
Fernando believes that in an era where private education is important in a country like Sri Lanka this is a way forward. “The state universities do not accommodate all the talented students. Nearly 400 students go abroad for medicine every year. It is very disappointing that our country is not willing to move forward but taking a step back by trying to eliminate the private institutions,” he said.
“I know many students who are foreign graduates; the spectrum of diseases they see is different to what we see here. The students who go to Russia or China do not get all these tropical diseases we get in Sri Lanka. That's one disadvantage they have”
When they are allowed to practice in Sri Lanka, why cannot we?, he questioned.
Fernando highlighting that they have been trained by senior lecturers and professors from state medical faculties, claimed that the school maintains strict quality controls over the course. “The administration is very concerned about producing doctors with better standards,” he said.
Questioning the impartiality of the SLMC report, ‘if SLMC is not satisfied with the level of training we gain in the forensic medicine, why cannot they support us?”.
But he is confident that the government will intervene to give them a solution soon.
“I have faith in the government, they have promised to provide us a better solution. And the institution will work out something for us,” he said hoping to pass out from SAITM as a doctor who could practice in Sri Lanka.
