Kusal Janith Perera is set to join the Sri Lankan Test squad as a replacement for the injured Dhammika Prasad, Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) announced.

Perera will head to England as soon as his visa formalities are taken care of, the cricket board said.

The 25-year-old, who last played a Test against India in August-September 2015, was provisionally suspended for testing positive for a banned substance. ICC subsequently withdrew all the charges, making Perera eligible to play international cricket again.

Prasad, suffering from a shoulder injury, missed the first Test against England and was later called back to Sri Lanka to undergo further treatment. Sanath Jayasuriya, the chief selector, said Perera was chosen as a replacement as the Sri Lankan squad had plenty of bowling options.

 Sri Lanka lost the first Test at Headingley, Leeds by an innings and 88 runs. The second Test is scheduled to start on Friday (May 27), and it remains to be seen of Perera is available for selection.
