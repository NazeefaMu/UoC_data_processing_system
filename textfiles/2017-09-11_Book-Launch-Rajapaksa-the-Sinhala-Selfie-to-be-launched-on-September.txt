A book written by political critic and journalist and a columnist contributor to the Daily Mirror, Kusal Perera titled “Rajapaksa the Sinhala Selfie”, introduced as a “Personal narrative in political categories” will be launched on Tuesday September 12, at the Sri Lanka Foundation Institute at 4.00 p.m.   

 

The book is about Sinhala politics, the role of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa as the most popular Sinhala leader in recent Sri Lankan politics and on political developments in post independent Sri Lanka, says Kusal Perera.



In an interview with Huffington Post he said:   

“The reason to have him so, is because I thought he is the most appropriate political figure to be sketched in an effort to trace the growth of Sinhala nationalism – by now the major deciding factor in mainstream politics that has evolved not simply as “Sinhala” but as “Sinhala-Buddhist.”   


The keynote address will be by Northern Province Chief Minister Justice C.V. Wigneswaran while communication specialist Krishan Siriwardhana would also address the event as the editor of the Sinhala volume “Children of ‘83” –a collection of essays on numerous topics written by Kusal Perera that were not published in mainstream media.
