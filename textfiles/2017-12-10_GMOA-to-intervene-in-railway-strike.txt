In a turn of events, the Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) said yesterday that it could intervene in the issue between the Railways Department and the striking trade unions in the event the actions taken by the authorities turn out to be a threat to the labour Rights of the employees.

GMOA Secretary Dr. Naveen de Zoysa said with the Gazette notification issued by President Maithripala Sirisena declaring railways as Essential Service, there was a threat to the employment of TU members.

However, he said that his union would come forward in support of them in such an event.

He said this after the railway trade unions had met with the GMOA and discussed the matter. (Darshana Sanjeewa and Thilanka Kanakarathna)
