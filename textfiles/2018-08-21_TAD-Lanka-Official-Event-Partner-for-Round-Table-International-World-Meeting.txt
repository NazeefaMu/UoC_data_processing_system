AtheekAnsar, Managing Director ofTAD Lanka commented, “The RTI World Meeting is the most important event in the RTI calendar. It is also a very important occasion for Sri Lanka to showcase its potential for tourism and investment to more than five hundred young and upwardly-mobile businessmen. Many delegates will be touring the country over two weeks including in Wilpattu, Anuradhapura, Sigiriya, Dambulla and Trincomalee. During these visits they will enjoy the beauty of Sri Lanka and the warm hospitality of the people. There will also be many business meetings during this time where Sri Lanka is expected to be the biggest beneficiary. TAD is privileged to be associated with RTI Sri Lanka in organising this event and we are sure that it will be a memorable event for all the delegates.”

Set up by Toshiaki, Atheek and Dhanuka, today TAD Lanka operates as the local partner of a number of ventures incorporated with Japanese FDIs handling the management, administration and operations of several sub-brands of one holding company. In addition to Japan, TAD has also expanded to the Maldives, Myanmar, Kenya and Uganda to attract FDIs from those countries.
