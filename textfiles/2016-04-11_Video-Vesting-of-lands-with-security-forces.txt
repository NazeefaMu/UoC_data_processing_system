A tense atmosphere prevailed at the Jaffna District Secretariat this morning when a group of individuals including Member of the Northern Provincial Council M.K. Shivajilingam (TNA) staged a protest at the Jaffna District Secretariat against vesting several lands in Manippai, Anekkoddai, and Kulawadi areas with the security forces.

They obstructed the entrance to the District Secretaries office and the District Secretary was compelled to enter the office through a rear door. The Provincial Council member said lands in several areas had been vested with the security forces and that it was a serious injustice to the residents of the area.

They handed over a memorandum requesting him to resolve the issue. (Pix by  Romesh Madusanka)
