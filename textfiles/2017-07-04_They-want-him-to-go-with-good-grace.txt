They want him to go with good grace


	



 

A very high political authority has informed a head of an establishment responsible for keeping law and order that it was high time for him to go home with grace. 

 


The high authority had conveyed this message at an official conference held to discuss a recent assault on varsity students. 


Meanwhile, this establishment head had become the butt of ridicule of his own subordinates when he was found in a deep slumber at a key seminar when the chief guest was addressing the gathering. 
The high official has now incurred the displeasure of all high authorities for the woeful lack of gumption he had demonstrated time and again when faced with the task of handling a difficulty situation.
