“Pilikawe Sebe Thathu” (The truth about cancer) is a timely book in Sinhala about cancer, the most dreaded killer disease next to AIDS. 
In a highly detailed book, two doctors – Dr. Jayantha Balawardhane and Dr. Duminda Handapangoda – cover in non-academic language a general overview of cancer including its history, its causes, types of cancer, types of treatment, as well as an introduction to phenomena such as pre-malignant lesions which if spotted and treated early can prevent the onset of cancer. The book looks into reasons for the common prevalence of cancer today, and methods of prevention.   
In the second part of the book, twenty seven types of cancer are identified. As the general public are not aware what the symptoms of even the most common types of cancer are, the information given in this section will be very useful to readers. The third part details how testing can identify cancers, including relatively simple self-testing which can be done by an individual at home, as well as treatment and medication available, and contains related topics such as if there is any connection between mobile phones and cancer, cancer and sexuality and common misconceptions about cancer. 
(The book is an author publication priced at Rs. 900)
