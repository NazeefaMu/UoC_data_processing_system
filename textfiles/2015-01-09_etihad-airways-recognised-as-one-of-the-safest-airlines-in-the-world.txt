Etihad Airways, the national airline of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), has been recognised as one of the top 10 safest airlines in the world.The internationally-regarded website www.AirlineRatings. com selected Etihad Airways as one of the safest airlines for 2015, out of a list of 449 global airlines monitored, while only 149 of the 449 have the top seven-star safety ranking.
The Airline Ratings system takes into account a variety of factors related to audits from aviation’s governing bodies and lead associations, as well as government audits and the airlines’ own records.
Etihad Airways President and Chief Executive Officer James Hogan said, “Our commitment to the safety and security of our guests and staff is a cornerstone of our company. We’re naturally delighted to be listed in the top 10 and that’s where we want to stay. All of our staff are accountable for the delivery of the highest level of safety performance.”
As an example of the company’s approach, Etihad Airways’ Innovation Centre in Abu Dhabi is home to the airline’s Training Academy, which comprises the largest A380 and B787 cabin and safety trainer facility in the world. Measuring around 30 metres long and between six and four metres high, the safety trainers are fully functioning models and were built under licence, using data supplied byAirbus and Boeing.
AirlineRatings.com Editor Geoffrey Thomas said, “Etihad Airways is one of small group of elite airlines that is both sevenstar for safety and for product. From a safety perspective, Etihad Airways has made excellence in safety a number one priority and has become a benchmark for best practice.”
All staff in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and overseas are required to comply with the regulations issued by the UAE’s General Civil Aviation Authority (GCAA), IATA’s Operational Safety Audit (IOSA) and the regulations issued by the local authorities in the country of the operation.
