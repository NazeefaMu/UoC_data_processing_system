Hooking by hook or by crook


	



The hooking game so far confined to the main political parties has made its way to some minor political parties as well, they say.


Going by the reports, it is the Tree party with a voter base in the East and led by a beleaguered leader from the Central Province which is going to be most affected by the ongoing action by some players of this game.


The Tree party leader reportedly got a jolt the other day when he learnt that one of his close followers had agreed to pole-vault to the rival party led by the political wizard of Wilpattu fame at a tryst arranged at the residence of a leading businessman. 


What has raised more eye brows is an extension to this story that a certain purohita in yahapalanaya is manipulating the main actors in this particular hooking game from behind the scenes.
