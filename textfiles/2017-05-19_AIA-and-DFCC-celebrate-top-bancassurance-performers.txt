A grand awards ceremony was held at the Kings Court, Cinnamon Lakeside, recently, to recognize the top performers from AIA and DFCC’s bancassurance channel.
The ceremony, aimed at celebrating the success of the bancassurance partnership between AIA Insurance and DFCC Bank is a testament to the strength of the relationship between the two parties. 
The AIA DFCC Awards Ceremony felicitated all those from the AIA bancassurance and the bank branch team who excelled in 2016, due to their commitment and dedication to develop the bancassurance channel. 
The award for Best AIA Bancassurance Executive of 2016 went to Nishara Gunawardena, while Naveendra Narangoda walked away with the award for ‘Best Cluster Head-Value Generation’. Nishan Rangana won the award for ‘Best Cluster Head-Volume Generation’. P. Ghengatharan of the Kotahena branch won the title of Top Bank Introducer. The most prestigious award for the night which was ‘The Best Branch’ award was won by the Kotahena branch with Galle and Batticoloa honoured as first and second runners-up, respectively. 
Notably, AIA has 29 Million Dollar Round Table members (MDRT) from its bancassurance channel, out of which six of them are attached to the DFCC bank operation. These six MDRT members were also recognized at the awards ceremony, for their outstanding achievement. MDRT membership is internationally recognized as the highest standard of excellence in the world that a life insurance sales person can achieve. 
AIA CEO Pankaj Banerjee said at the event “we are proud of our competent team of top performers who have helped take this partnership between AIA and DFCC to greater heights. As Asia’s leading insurer, our customers have come to rely on us to deliver world-class products and services that offer value to them. It is indeed our team of proficient bancassurance personnel who enables our customers to find the highest quality of products to suit their protection needs, while ensuring a positive customer experience with AIA. They are key to our success and it is only fitting that we celebrate their success with pride.” 
DFCC CEO Arjun Fernando congratulated the winners while commenting on the partnership. “I congratulate all the top performers who have demonstrated their commitment towards the future growth and development of the bancassurance business. The long-term agreement between AIA and DFCC was forged to create value for our customers, providing them with competitively priced insurance and banking solutions that can meet their diverse financial and protection needs and we are delighted to recognize our strong teams that contribute so notably to this initiative.”
