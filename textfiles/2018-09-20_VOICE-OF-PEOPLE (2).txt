I am happy to see the growing movement of Sri Lankans who are committed to mindful living. This includes social entrepreneurs working to address social and environmental problems, responsible business leaders who choose to prioritize people and planet over short term profits, and the artists and storytellers who inspire us and help us envision a better world. It also includes the broader community of people making changes in their day to day lives: refusing plastic straws, plastic bottles and plastic bags, planting trees and home gardens, reducing waste and recycling, volunteering and contributing to causes they care about, asking where products came from, and supporting businesses that share their values. I am happy and proud that Sri Lanka is in the top 10 in the Global Giving Index.” Achala SamaradiwakaraFounder – Good Market
