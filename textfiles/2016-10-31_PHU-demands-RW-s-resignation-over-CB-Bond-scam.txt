The Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) today demanded the resignation of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe over the Central Bank (CB) Bond sale scam.

It said if the Premier didn’t resign, the party would be compelled to bring in a no-confidence motion against him.

“The bond issue took place in the Treasury, when it came under the purview of Prime Minister. Former CB Governor Arjuna Mahendran, who is in hot water today, had said that the controversial deal was made following the directions of the Subject Minister. Therefore, the Premier should resign,” PHU General Secretary MP Udaya Gammanpila told a news conference. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
