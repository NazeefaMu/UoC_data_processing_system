Central Province Women stickers have it easy

An effervescent display by Central Province women stickers helped them to trounce Western Province by the massive margin of seven goals to zero to win the women's hockey championship at the 41st National Sports Festival organized by the Ministry of Sports and played at the Sports Ministry Astro turf recently.
Winning the finals by such a huge margin that too against a top side like the Western Province with the best of basic amenities, including two astro turf facilities by a bunch comprising mostly village lasses is very creditable.
The team was captained by national player Pradeepa Nilmini Nandasena fair complexioned and looks a foreigner who motivated the team to the maximum. They scored 31 goals in 3 matches while conceding none. In this respect though stocky but very supple and agile goal keeper Jeewanthi Keerthiratne was very outstanding as she kept a Hawk's eye on the opponents especially when within the semi circle. With her as the custodian, it looked the goal posts were non existent.
Her remarkable performance is that she conceded only one goal in the entire tournament which includes club level inter district in the run up to the National Sports Festival. No wonder she is rated as number one goal keeper in the country for the last seven years from the time she ousted Tharuni Perera from this position. If there was a Best Goal Keeper's award she would have grabbed it eyes closed.
This tournament saw the Central Province stickers coached by former national captain Wasana Ekanayake hardly having any opposition. In all the matches it was a one way traffic. They beat Eastern Province 14-0 and Northern Province 10-0 and the Western Province 10-0. What was most praiseworthy was the fact that they were attuned to meet all situations - whether it was a challenge of skills or the hit and stop game of the Northern Province or the aggressiveness of the Eastern Province Ladies.
The forward line had the belligerence and had national captains Chathurika Wijesuriya, Madhushani Jayanetti, Maneesha Dissanaike, skipper Pradeepa Nilmini Nandasena, Yamuna Wijesuriya, Madura Dharmaratne, Aruni Jayasinghe, Susanthika Themiyadasa and who simply tore into the opponents defence which was seen in tatters. Madura Dharmaratne won the Best Players award.
In the defence line it was right back Geethani Abeyratne, Geethika Nandasena, Chathurika Premasiri, Dharshani Herath Arundika Gunawardena and Samadara Chathurika who put up a rock like fortress to stop the opponents. Geethani Abeyratne fed the forwards well with some neat passes. In addition to this there were two promising school girls from Sangamittha Girls College, Matale in Bhaghya Kodituwakku and Nawanjana Ekanayake.
The team played as a well drilled unit and when you take individually they were from the villages around Kandy where there is no hockey at all. They were mostly products of Seetha Devi Balika Vidyalaya and they are mostly turning out for Sri Lanka and coached by M A M Ashroff at District and club level. The squad: Pradeepa Nilmini Nandasena, Jeewanthika Nandasena, Maneesha Dissanayake, Chathurika Wijesuriya, Yamuna Wijesuriya, Geethani Abeyratne, Dharshani Herath, Geethika Nandasena, Madura Dharmaratne, Madhushani Jayanetti, Aruni Jayasinghe, Susanthika Themiyadasa, Chathurika Premasiri, Anandie Rajapaksa, Arundika Gunawardena, Samadara Chathurika, Nawanjana Ekanayake, Bhaghya Kodituwakku. Coach Wasana Ekanayake.
