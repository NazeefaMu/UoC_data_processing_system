Garcia’s try gives Italy victory over Canada

Gonzalo Garcia scored Italy’s 50th World Cup try to help his country secure a narrow but vital 23-18 victory over Canada in a riveting encounter on Saturday.
The result was cruel for the Canadians who lost a similarly tight duel with the same opponents 19-14 in the 2003 World Cup. They dominated for long periods and scored the try of the tournament so far through DTH van der Merwe.
Italy’s win after a heavy defeat to France in their opener gives them a boost eight days from an intimidating encounter with Six Nations champions Ireland.
Canada’s sole consolation was a defensive bonus point. Nathan Hirayama gave Canada a deserved lead in the 15th minute with a penalty after the Canadians had threatened the Italian tryline on several occasions in the opening salvoes. A minute later Canada scored the try of the tournament so far, started and finished by van der Merwe, who broke from deep inside his own half down the left wing and passed to Ciaran Heard.
Heard sucked in his man and passed back to the onrushing van der Merwe, who had come inside and easily danced round the remaining Italian defender to touch down under the posts.

Hirayama converted for 10-0.
The jolt had the desired effect on a somnolent and indolent Italy, who struck back immediately prompted by a superb solo run from scrum-half Edoardo Gori.
He outfoxed John Moonlight and quickly put dayling between himself and the lumbering back row forward before being brought to ground. The chance was not lost as Michele Rizzo went over once the ball had been worked back.
Tommaso Allan converted for 10-7 and the former Scotland Under-20 international -- who opted for the land of his mother’s birth for senior Test rugby -- levelled affairs in the 25th minute with a penalty. Allan had to go off shortly afterwards for a head injury assessment and replaced by Carlo Canna, who put Italy ahead on the stroke of half-time as he converted a penalty for a 13-10 lead.
