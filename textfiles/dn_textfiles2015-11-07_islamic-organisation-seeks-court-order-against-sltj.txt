Islamic organisation seeks Court order against SLTJ

An Islamic organisation yesterday sought an order from the Colombo Chief Magistrate to prevent the Sri Lanka Tawheed Jamath (SLTJ) Organisation from organising an event which is said to be detrimental to religious harmony in the country.
Filing a motion before Chief Magistrate Gihan Pilapitiya, the Nabaviyyah Islamic Youth Organisation informed Court that the peaceful co-existence of the Muslim community in Sri Lanka has been gradually harmed by a certain group called the SLTJ, a group extreme and radical by their action and preaching.
The Counsel appearing for the Islamic Youth Organisation informed that the SLTJ has been the cause of problems in many Muslim villages and mosques.
"They have been very critical of the teachings of the Buddha causing damage to the harmony and trust among the Muslims and the Sinhalese."
The Counsel said they have received information that this extremist group was planning to organise an event on November 8 at the Sugathadasa Indoor Stadium. They said this event is to be attended by P. Jainul Abdeen who is an Indian citizen (based in Tamil Nadu) as the chief guest. They complained that six members of this organisation have a case in court over making derogatory remarks about the Buddha.
The Chief Magistrate observed that he would not issue an order against this organisation since court was not satisfied with the material before Court that the suspects who had been released by court were involved in organising this event. The Court directed that a complaint be made before the Colombo Crimes Division which had earlier commenced investigations against this organisation.
