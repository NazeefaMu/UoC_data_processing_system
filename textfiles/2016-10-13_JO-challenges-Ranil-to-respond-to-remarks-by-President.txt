The joint opposition today challenged Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to give a direct response to the statement made by President Maithripala Sirisena on Wednesday including the President’s displeasure at former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa being dragged to court after a case was filed against him by the Bribery Commission.

Addressing a media briefing, joint opposition MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage said the President had directly pointed his finger at the Prime Minister, accusing him of engaging in a political witch-hunt in the guise of investigating financial fraud through the CID, FCID and Bribery Commission.

“The President has stated that he was not aware of such cases against the former Defence Secretary and three former commanders of the Navy. He has directly stated that these institutions cannot function according to a political agenda. It has now been proved that these institutions have continuously misled the country in order to fullfil the requirements of someone's political agenda,” he added.

He said it was evident from the President’s statement that he had lost the trust he had in the Prime Minister and that he was against the policies of the UNP. He also said this development was a warning sign to the Government that it would be toppled in the near future.

Meanwhile, joint opposition MP Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena said the joint opposition would offer their fullest support to the President to help him put a stop to the corruption seen in the government under the UNP's leadership. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)
