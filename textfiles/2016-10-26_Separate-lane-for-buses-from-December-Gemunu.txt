The Megapolis and Western Region Development Minister had approved the separate lane for buses during peak hours from Battaramulla to Colombo Fort from December 1, Lanka Private Bus Owners’ Association Chairman (LPBOA) Gemunu Wijeyaratne said yesterday.

While addressing a media briefing yesterday, he said the request that he had made to the relevant authorities long time ago and it had now become a reality.

We had discussed this separate bus lane issue with the Megapolis Minister and it had been decided to come in to operation from December first week, he said.

“We decided to use ‘low flow buses’. While using ‘low flow buses’ we hope many people will get used to it instead using their own vehicles and thereby minimise the road traffic.

Unfortunately, the new bus lane had not been approved on the expressways. But Minister Ranawaka had intervened to provide us with a good solution. We are thankful to the Minister and now we could see there is a Minister who can really get the work done, Mr. Wijerathne said.

There are lots of government institutions situated in Battaramulla and those institutions can request buses for their transport services.

“Those allocated transport services will be operated with half the normal fare for the government employees,” he said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)
