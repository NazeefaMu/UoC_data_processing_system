TNA to avoid Independence Day Celebrations


	

The Tamil National Alliance (TNA) yesterday said its members would not participate in the Independence Day National Celebration due to local government election campaign activities in the Trincomalee District.

Opposition Leader and TNA MP R. Sampanthan has officially informed this to the Independence Day Celebrations Committee.

TNA sources said MP Sampanthan would participate in the LG election public meetings and rallies in Trincomalee in February 4.

Meanwhile, it is learnt that some candidates of several Tamil political parties have decided to hoist black flags in the North and North East areas to express the displeasure stating that although the country had gained freedom 70 years ago, the Tamil communities had not yet tasted true freedom.
