Sajith says declined to accept PM post ten times


	

UNP Deputy Leader Sajith Premadasa yesterday said he had declined to oblige President Maithripala Sirisena when he offered him the post of Prime Minister ten times.

Responding to a journalist who asked Mr. Premadasa why he declined it, he said “One might have personal aspirations of becoming leaders but things should be done in accordance with the law of the country. I am the Deputy Leader of the UNP and I am bound to work in accordance with the decisions made by my party."

Earlier, Mr. Premadasa hailed comments made by Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe and MP Ven. Athureliye Rathana Thera that those who command a majority in Parliament should be allowed to form a government as fair remarks.

Mr. Premadasa expressed this sentiment during a media briefing held at parliamentary complex last morning.

At the same time Mr. Premadsa said there was no provision to form a caretaker government under the constitution. He was referring to the request made by Ven. Rathana Thera to form a multi party caretaker government and go for a general election. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)
