	A group of Blue bigwigs were putting their thick heads together, the other day, to decide what action they should take if the new Big Boss failed to dissolve the Diyawanna council by April 23.

The senior Banda from the Hills, Gentle John from the City of Gems, Flamboyant Dilan from Uva and Artful Amare from the Deep South were among the participants at this discussion.
“Perhaps, the Greens will quit the government in a huff,” one of them hazarded a guess. “What should we do if they quit?” another asked.
“We command the majority in the House and there is another year for the term to expire. Let us form a new government under the leadership of the Compassionate One.”
“Will he agree to such an arrangement?”
This drew a quick response from the first interlocutor. “He is left with no other alternative. After all, he is the leader of our party.”
The most senior politico of the group said with unconcealed elation: “If we can form a government of our own, we can face the general elections with the added advantage of a Ministerial portfolio under our belt. And that would be fine!”
They finally decided to discuss the matter with the new Big Boss.
