South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) Chairman Dr. Neville Fernando said today he was pleased to note that the GMOA had accepted the government’s solution on the SAITM issue even with some reservations.

In a statement in response to the Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) stance, Dr. Fernando said he had forgotten the past few years and hoped the GMOA would also reciprocate.

“I will remain content with regard to achieving and establishing the right to freedom of education in Sri Lanka,” he said.

Meanwhile, he urged the GMOA to urge the students of the State medical faculties to resume their lectures and clinical training enabling them to qualify, obtain post graduate training and become consultants, which was the vision of every medical student.
