Writ petition challenging FCID postponed

The writ petition filed by Ven. Elle Gunawansa Thero and Prof. Carlo Fonseka challenging legality of the Police Financial Crimes Investigations Division (FCID) was yesterday fixed for support on November 6 by the Court of Appeal.
When the petition came up before Court of Appeal Justices Vijith K. Malalgoda and H.C.J. Madawala, the Attorney General sought a further date to file written submissions.
Ven. Elle Gunawansa Thera and Prof. Fonseka had cited the Inspector General of Police as the respondent and sought Court intervention to quash the order published in the gazette notification bearing No.1901/20 dated February 13, 2015 by which the purported FCID allegedly set up which is ultra vires and illegal.
The petitioners stated that the FCID was purportedly established under section 55 of the Police Ordinance. Section 55 does not vest any power with the IGP to establish a separate functional division in the Police Department and it only empowers to make orders and regulations in respect of matters set out therein which are ordinarily called house rules.
They further maintained that the FCID is violative of the imperative of the provisions of the law and specifically ultra virus provisions of the Police Ordinance.
They stated that the Gazette notification published in terms of Section 55 is ultra vires of the Police Ordinance and therefore any investigation carried out under the FCID is of no force of law and therefore a nullity.
