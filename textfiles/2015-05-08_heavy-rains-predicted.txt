The Department of Metrology today predicted heavy rains exceeding 100mm in the coming days due to the influence of Inter tropical Convergence Zone ( the area where the Northern and Southern hemispheric winds meet) settling over Sri Lanka.
Showers or thunder showers exceeding 100mm could be expected at most parts of the island during the afternoon.
Few showers could be expected in the coastal areas extending from Puttlam to Matara via Colombo and Galle in the morning as well.
Temporary localized strong winds were predicted during thundershowers. General public were requested to take adequate precautions to minimize damages caused by lightning activity.
Meanwhile heavy showers were reported from many areas with maximum rainfall of 85.1mm recording from Pasyala, 39mm Ratmalana, 34mm from Moneragala, and 53.6mm from Anurdhapura. (YP)
