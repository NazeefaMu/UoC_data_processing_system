India (Hindustan Times), Jan 18, 2018 -  The Congress on Thursday accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi and external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj of misleading the nation over Chinese troops occupying the Doklam plateau, saying Indian security and strategic interests have been compromised.  


“The satellite imagery and media reports suggest that China has established military establishments in Doklam near Indian borders which indicates that India’s security and strategic interests have been compromised,” said Congress spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala.  


The Congress’ reaction comes a day after media reports cited new satellite images to say that the infrastructure build-up in Doklam — the site of a tense standoff between the two countries last summer — included a “full-fledged” military base.   NDTV and ThePrint reported that satellite pictures taken on December 10, 2017 — roughly three-and-a-half months after India and China agreed to end their stand-off — showed new helipads, trenches and construction work at the Doklam plateau.  


ThePrint described one of the constructions as “concrete” and said that there was at least one complete mechanised regiment deployed. According to NDTV, the build-up was at two locations at the Doklam plateau and one of them was “a massive, full-fledged Chinese military complex”.   Showing the satellite images, Surjewala said China had constructed a two-storey watch tower, seven helipads and several military establishments in Doklam.
