PM may use Law and Order portfolio to shield Mahendran: GL


	

While claiming that Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe had no moral right to be appointed as the Minister of law and Order, Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) Chairman G.L. Peiris claimed that the PM would make use the new portfolio to protect Central Bank’s former governor Arjuna Mahendran who is implicated in the bond scam.

He told a news briefing that the PM would do whatever was possible to prevent Mr. Mahendran from coming to Sri Lanka because the PM was aware that if Mr. Mahendran came to Sri Lanka and gave the evidence on the bond scam, the PM would be in big trouble.  (Sheain Fernandopulle)
