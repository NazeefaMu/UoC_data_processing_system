Entire Parliament transformed into government: PM

 
The proposed new sectoral oversight committees to be set up in Parliament should have powers to summon not only officials but also Provincial Chief Ministers and Provincial Ministers, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
The Prime Minister said this delivering the keynote address at the inauguration of a three day workshop on oversight committees attended by Parliamentarians at Committee Room 1 of the Kotte Parliamentary Complex yesterday. A delegation of UK Parliamentarians led by Labour Party MP Fiona Mctaggart is also attending the workshop.
The Prime Minister said the government had taken steps to transform the entire Parliament into a government.
There was only a single committee in the Westminster System of government in Britain and that was the Cabinet which took policy decisions and Members of Parliament were the section which represented the people. The other committee system was in the United States where it operated to impose limitations on Presidential powers, he said.
The Prime Minister said Members of Parliament were the section which represented the people. Some of them function as ministers and deputy ministers. But actually the backbenchers had no functions to perform, the Prime Minister said. Making some of the Parliamentarians as ministers and deputy ministers and relegating others to the backbenches without any work was unjustifiable. As time passes only ministers and officials become the main performers of work. But this work should be handed over to Parliament to make it the Chief Centre of Governance, he said.
The Prime Minister said Parliament had control over public finance.
"The President or the Cabinet of Ministers had no powers to control public finance. We should strive to further strengthen this power of Parliament. Party polices had a say in the adoption of the Budget. There are the COPE and Public Accounts Committees. What they do was to review expenditure and see whether such expenditure was correct or wrong," he said.
"This could be likened to the system in a funeral parlour where you go and see a body after embalming it and express your sympathy after the work is done. I have seen officials in certain areas taking action disregarding the law. Some officials acted in a manner that caused injustice to women and minorities. If you look at the CEB they spend more funds for their own regions or areas," Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said.
Former President D.B. Wijetunga earlier held portfolios of Posts and Telecommunications, Power, Agriculture and Finance. What more did one need to look after and cater to an electorate? he asked.
The Prime Minister said the workshop was aimed to explain the working of the oversight committees. Chairmen of these committees would not be ministers. Ministers too should have attended this workshop. If not this would create unneccessary problems and laws should be amended to give over powers to the MPs as well, he said.
