LG elections: Demarcation of electoral boundaries causes delay

The government has no intention of postponing the Local Government election but the process of demarcating of electoral boundaries takes a certain time, Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister Faizer Mustapha said.
The minister was addressing the media at the Government Information Department yesterday.
Mustapha added that however, the Local Government election is expected to be held in June after resolving issues regarding the demarcation of electoral boundaries in the local government wards.
The minister said around 2,000 proposals and appeals with regard to the demarcation have to be considered prior to holding the Local Government polls. "Those suggestions sent by the main political parties with regard to the boundary definitions have to be considered. Each and every appeal is considered during the process of demarcating electoral boundaries," he added.
Mustapha said officials who work on demarcation were advised by the President to take every appeal into consideration aiming to make appropriate boundary definitions.
The minister noted that the intention of the President and the Prime Minister is to take the provisions in the 20th Amendment to the constitution to the rural level.
Accordingly, this is a move to create an MP, who is responsible to an electorate or Local Government division, Mustapha said.
He noted that the Local Government polls will only be held under the new electoral system since the Local Government Act has already been revised.
