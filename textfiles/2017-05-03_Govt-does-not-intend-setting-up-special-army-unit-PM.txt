Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said today the Cabinet had not taken any decision to set up a special army unit and that the President was the head of the security forces according to the law.

He said this in response to a question asked by JVP MP Vijitha Herath on the controversy over the appointment of Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka as a head of the security forces.

"Field Marshal Fonseka has experience working as an army commander. The President and myself have admired his contribution both in the Cabinet and outside. We do not intend setting up any special army unit. We use the security forces only to safeguard the country's sovereignty and security," the Prime Minister said.

MP Herath said Cabinet Spokesman Rajitha Senaratne had categorically stated that the President had requested SF to take up a post in the security forces.

The Prime Minister said he could not reveal what was discussed at the Cabinet meeting except the decisions taken by it.

He said Minister Senaratne would explain to parliament what he said at the Cabinet briefing and added that the government's attention was only focused how to maintain essential services without interruption or disruption. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)
