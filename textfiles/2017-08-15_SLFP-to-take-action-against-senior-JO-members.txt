The Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) has decided to take disciplinary action against five party seniors, political sources said.

According to those sources, some SLFP ministers have requested President Maithripala Sirisena to take steps against these five Joint Opposition members due to the fact that they have acted against decisions taken by the SLFP Central Committee and the common stance of the party.
