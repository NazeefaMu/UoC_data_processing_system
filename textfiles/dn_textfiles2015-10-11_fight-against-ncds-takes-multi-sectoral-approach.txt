More attention needed to improve schoolchildren's health
Fight against NCDs takes multi-sectoral approach

Children of school going age are another group who are at a higher risk of developing non-communicable diseases (NCDs) needing urgent preventive measures to be taken.
Out of school going children, 15 to 30 percent are obese or overweight, while 10 percent of the children are at pre-diabetic stage while one percent of schoolchildren already suffer from diabetes, said Director, Non Communicable Diseases Unit, Ministry of Health and Indigenous Medicine Dr. Thilak Siriwardhana.
However, despite the Health Ministry recommending focus on physical training and education as a part of mitigation plan, implementation is still not at 100 percent. Next year, the Health Ministry is recommending even more preventive action.
"We recommend Health science to be reintroduced as a compulsory subject to the curricular, with practical lessons and tests as well. Right now it is in the basket of optional subjects and many children opt for other subjects,"he said.
The situation is reflective of the increasing trend of NCDs in the in the country. In Sri Lanka, 75 percent of deaths are caused by cardiovascular diseases, cancer, chronic respiratory disease and diabetes.
The probability of dying between ages 30 and 70 from one of the four main NCDs, cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes mallitus or chronic respiratory disease was 17.6 percent.
In an attempt to arrest the trend (NCDs) reaching epidemic, now at epidemic levels in the country, the Health Ministry s launching a multi-sectoral plan from next year.
A number of key ministries including education, agriculture, youth and sports will be implementing a joint strategy with the Health Ministry taking the lead.
The National Multi- sectoral Action Plan for NCD prevention and 2013-2020 is being finalised by the Health and Indigenous Medicine Ministry.
Changing the focus from treatment of NCDs, representative, WHO Sri Lanka Dr Jacob Kumaresan, said the focus is now on prevention to save future generations from health socio-economic harm of such diseases.

"It is the basically lifestyle of the people that effect their health. In the 1970s, Sri Lanka was highly affected by infectious diseases such as Malaria, Diarrohea and Tuberculosis. The government controlled the diseases and today we rarely witness people dying due to infectious diseases. Non Communicable Diseases are not similar diseases. The issues pertaining to the NCD are involved with our life style," said Dr. Kumaresan. He said that the risk factors such as a person's background, lifestyle and environment are known to increase the likelihood of certain non-communicable diseases.
Speaking about the measures, he said that there is a set of cost effective and affordable evidence based policies for tackling NCDs that was endorsed by the World Health Assembly.
As part of the strategy, the Sports Ministry will train over 2,000 physical training instructors from the Education Ministry on NCD prevention measures next year. The ministry will also launch a project to build open gyms in every divisional secretariat areas.
"They are planning to complete this project within the next year itself. The ministry will also work with local authorities to set up walkways in each division to encourage public to engage in physical activity," Dr. Siriwardhena explained.
Besides this, the Agriculture Ministry will also set up a plan to change farming patterns with the aim of increasing vegetable and fruit consumption among Sri Lankans.
The Health Ministry intends to focus on improving health through reducing the usage of alcohol and tobacco. At present Sri Lanka has a high tobacco and alcohol usage, with one third male population using tobacco.
"The Health Ministry has stopped all advertisements related to alcohol and tobacco. The government already implemented the plan of using pictorial warning on cigarette packets and measures are being taken to make the packets non attractive," he said.

The measures, the ministry intends to implement with the support of many government and non-government sectors for the tobacco demand reduction are taxation, smoke free policies and health warnings.
Harmful use of alcohol reduction measures are availability regulations, advertising, promotion bans and pricing policies.
The Health Ministry also plans to train youth to carry out preventive and awareness programmes partnering with the Youth Affairs Ministry. Members of over 2,000 youth clubs are to be trained through the programme.
The multi-secotoral programme, to be launched early next year is funded through a US$ 200 million soft loan with 11 UN agencies providing support services and technical assistance to state agencies.
