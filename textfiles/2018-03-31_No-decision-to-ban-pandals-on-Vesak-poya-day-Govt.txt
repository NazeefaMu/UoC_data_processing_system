The government has not taken a policy decision to ban the conduct of ‘Dansalas’ and the display of Vesak pandals in view of Vesak, the Information Department said in a statement. 

The statement said there was no barrier for any citizen to do so as he wishes in view of Vesak. The statement said Subject Minister Gamini Jayawickrama Perera only stressed the point that it would be appropriate for devotees to focus on ‘Pratipatti Pooja’ instead of ‘Amisa Pooja’ on Poya Day.
