REUTERS, 19th APRIL, 2017- Polls closed after a mostly smooth vote on Wednesday in Jakarta’s divisive election between a Muslim and a Christian candidate that stoked religious tensions in the capital of the world’s third-largest democracy.


Police said 15 people were detained following reports of disturbances at several polling stations in the city of 10 million people, after what the Jakarta Post this week dubbed “the dirtiest, most polarizing and most divisive” election campaign the nation had ever seen.
