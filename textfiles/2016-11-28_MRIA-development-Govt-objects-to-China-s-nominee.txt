MRIA development: Govt. objects to China's nominee


	

The government has objected to the conditions stipulated by the party first nominated by China for the development of the Mattala International Airport, it is said.

Along with the Hambantota Port, the government has decided to sell off the airport under what it called a ‘debt to equity swap.’ The debt component, obtained by the Government of Sri Lanka for the construction of the airport at that time, is to be absorbed by the company that buys it.

According to a report submitted to the Cabinet, the government has informed the Chinese government that it cannot agree to the conditions laid down by its nominee to develop the airport.

Accordingly, a new party was to be nominated.(Kelum Bandara)
