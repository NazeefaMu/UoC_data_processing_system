Controversial ‘Water Creatures Beach Guest Restaurant & Surf Bar’ in Mirissa, where a group of Dutch tourists were brutally assaulted, has been shut down following an order from the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA) a short while ago.

Six suspects were earlier arrested by Weligama Police in connection with the incident and remanded until April 19 after the Daily Mirror exposed the incident. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
