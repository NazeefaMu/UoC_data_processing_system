The indefinite work stoppage by railway unions from Wednesday (29) midnight, would depend on the response of the National Salaries and Cadre Commission, Railway Technical Services Trade Union Committee (RTSTUC) said.

The union held discussions with the National Salaries and Cadre Commission this morning, where the commission assured it would resolve their salary anomalies.

Union’s Secretary Saman Pieris told Daily Mirror that the commission agreed to place railway employees on salary scales under adjustment of grades.  
 

“We were planning to launch the strike from last night, but we decided to launch strike from Wednesday midnight considering the rail commuters who are planning to visit Kandy to witness ‘Dalada Easala Perahera’ and those students facing Advance level examination,” he said.
