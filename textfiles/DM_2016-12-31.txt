President overturns decision to rent out 58 vehicles to MPs
	
President Maithripala Sirisena said the decision taken to spend large sums to provide vehicles on rent basis to 58 Parliamentarians who were holding the Chairmanship posts of Regional Development Committees would not be implemented.
Speaking to the Daily Mirror he further said a decision would be taken to implement a new system at the cabinet meeting held next week.
He further said the decision taken to provide vehicles on rent basis would ultimately result in the renting company owning the vehicles, and not the Parliamentarian or the government.
He also said he had discussed a new system for supplying vehicles to Parliamentarians with the Prime Minister. (Ajantha Kumara Agalakada)

Sovereignty, territorial integrity would hang in the balance in 2017 - MR
	
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa said yesterday that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Sri Lanka and the fate of future generations would hang in the balance in 2017 under this increasingly dysfunctional government.
In a statement, he said 2017 would be the year in which the future of Sri Lanka would be decided.
The governments devolution package to divide the country into what they call distinct spheres of authority, the ETCA with India to open up Sri Lanka to Indian service providers and workers, the privatisation of the Hambantota harbour and other government owned assets, are just some of the unwelcome changes that the government has planned in the new year. All this will come on top of the gross economic mismanagement, declining growth rate, declining foreign reserves, the deteriorating exchange rate, increased taxation, increased interest rates, increasing inflation and a phenomenal increase in the national debt that we have seen over the past two years, he said in the statement.
He said the SLFP members in the government who were elected to parliament on an anti-UNP, anti-government platform, but have since joined the UNP led government, now appear to be engaged in a struggle with their conscience.
While condemning Arjuna Mahendran over the bond scam, they defend the Prime Minister. They criticise the UNP in public but vote with them on the VAT Bill, the Office of Missing Persons Bill and the Budget. They co-operate with the Joint Opposition to defeat the Super Minister Bill, but at the same time they co-operate with the UNP on the devolution proposals. At this decisive moment, they should be mindful of the future of the country, above everything else, Mr. Rajapaksa said.
He said those who hold portfolios and vote with the government on important matters were members of the government, despite any criticism they may make in public about other political parties and ministers in the government.
There are many Ministers and MPs in the SLFP group as well as the UNP who are genuinely perturbed by what the government has been doing. When the leaders of the Joint Opposition so decide, the doors of the anti-government coalition of forces will be thrown open to all such individuals, he said.

Third round of talks on ETCA to be held on Jan. 4 and 5
	
The third round of talks between India and Sri Lanka on an Economic and Technical Cooperation Agreement (ETCA) will be held on January 4 an 5, a Sri Lankan official told Indian Express yesterday.
Negotiations on ETCA have become tougher and tougher over the past year as both sides are now keen on clinching a good deal without unrealistic compromises.
Indias stand on trade negotiations with Sri Lanka has toughened since the signing of the India-Sri Lanka Free Trade Agreement (ISLFTA) and its operationalization in 2000. Despite many concessions given to Sri Lanka in the ISLFTA, in recognition of the asymmetry between the Indian and Sri Lankan economies, Sri Lankans have been viewing the ISLFTA as being disadvantageous to their country.
While Indians say that Sri Lankan exports to India would never have increased so many times without the ISLFTA, the Sri Lankans cite the many Non-Tariff Barriers (NTBs) in India to say that their exports would have been much more if only India did not have so many Non-Tariff Barriers (NTBs).
The huge imbalance in trade is an irritant for Sri Lankans but Indians say that balance in trade is not necessary in every case nor is it necessarily a sign of health.
India is no longer keen on sacrificing the economic interests of its private sector for the sake of friendship with another country as its economy is now private-sector driven. Therefore the Narenda Modi government is bargaining hard on the provisions of ETCA.
The Sri Lankans, on the other hand, are also negotiating hard because Sri Lankan businessmen and entrepreneurs are worried about Indian economic dominance and the flooding of the labor market by Indian professionals and workers. The fear of an Indian influx is widespread and deep despite Indias assurances that ETCA would not involve the movement of natural persons or personnel. But Sri Lankans say that Sri Lankans would be motivated to employ less expensive Indian professionals rather than their own high prices ones. Also, many services can be rendered without physical movement of personnel.
Sri Lankans also allege that already many firms employ Indians on the sly and site the booming construction industry as an example. (Indian Express)

Earlier, a month long general amnesty period was announced by the Defence Ministry starting from December 1 to 31 for tri-forces deserters to get their legal discharge.
This is the second general amnesty offered to tri-forces deserters during this year while the first was in effect from June 13th to July 12th.
Authorities have decided to take tough measures against deserters who fail to report during this amnesty period, the Ministry said.

Upsurge in cost of living Celebrating festive season and welcoming the new year
	


As the festive season brings to a close another eventful year many claim the cost of living to be burdensome, and overwhelmingly high. Economics experts point out that the rate of inflation has risen resulting in the rise of the cost of living. TheDailymirrorspoke to a wide cross section of society - beggars, coolie labourers, traders, businessmen, managers, and engineers - on what they felt about the cost of living.
Accordingly we found that sales have dropped and the general public were unable to manage their household budget due to the rising cost of living. While some expressed hope for long term prosperity envisioned through the yahapalanaya government, there seemed to be a growing dissent against the current government as well due to oppressive taxes which have made the cost of living unbearable to many. 
The annual average inflation increased from 0.9% in 2015 to around 4% in 2016, increasing the cost of living of the people.Vincent Mervin Fernando - Former Director of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka  
Colombo Consumer Price Index (CCPI) and the new National Consumer Price Index (NCPI) are the two main price indices used to measure the cost of living in Sri Lanka. The rate of inflation for the years 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017 are 3.3%, 0.9%, 4.0% and 4.0% respectively. 
He further added, Sri Lankas high inflation was an issue of concern when considering the cost of living for many years, particularly since the liberalization of the economy in Lanka during 1977. Sri Lankas inflation was on average around 11.2% for the period 1978-2008. This high rate of inflation has reduced to a mid-single digit average around 5.9% since 2009 to 2014. 
Speaking of the low inflation rate seen last year, he said, The year 2015 witnessed a generous package of welfare improving measures being implemented across various sectors of the economy encompassing a wider range of socio-economic strata.
Most of such measures were fashioned in the newly formed governments 100-Day Programme which was intended to provide immediate relief for people, among other objectives.
Excess taxes levied on 10 essential food items including sugar, milk powder, wheat flour, chillies etc. were lowered immediately, thereby reducing the market prices substantially. The price of a cylinder was reduced on two occasions while the increase of total allowances paid to public sector employees stood at Rs.10,000. Such relief measures generated a substantial amount of savings for people to meet their needs. As a result the average inflation decreased to 0.9% in December 2015 from 3.3%, which was the lowest percentage ever recorded since 1977. 
Further examining the sudden rise in inflation rate and subsequent rise in the cost of living he added, However the annual average inflation increased from 0.9% in 2015 to around 4% in 2016, increasing the cost of living of the people. This was mainly due to the increase of expenditure value of food items in rice, coconut, vegetables, potatoes, lime, big onions, tea leaves, dhal, coconut oil, red onions etc. However price decreases were reported for fresh fish, papaw, chicken, banana, mangoes, eggs and green chillies. Further very small increases in expenditure value were reported for groups of Transport and Restaurant and Hotels. The expenditure value increases in Health, Communication and Alcoholic beverages, Tobacco and Narcotics were a result of the implementation of the new Value Added Tax (VAT) rates with effect from November 1. However in conclusion, the CoL in Sri Lanka is 56.7% lower than in the United States, European and some other Asian countries.

Negative trends in society linked with cost of living
- Prof. Daya Amarasekara, University of Peradeniya
Social class can be interpreted as a social group experiencing similar economy and consumerism. Changes in social status, norms and values could be inspected within this group and all these changes are hard-wired with increasing cost of living. Imposing new taxes are a prominent cause for increased cost of living and that has affected all the social classes, namely the higher middle class, middle class and lower class. Poverty, prostitution and anti social activities are all connected with the struggle of life. People tend to be attracted to earn in secretive ways due to the high cost of living. he explained.
Exploitation of child labour is also increasing, because school leavers crushed by economic difficulties try to earn money without furthering their studies. Child labourers, flower vendors and candlestick sellers we see during rush hour traffic are some examples of child exploitation. The sociologist Frantz Fanon has pointed out a group of urban orphans called urban loompon group.
They are generally jobless, lives day to day by doing both good and bad. Drug peddling, vehicles theft, printing of counterfeit currency are some of these illegal activities they are engaged in. There is another group of people who leave the country with disappointment and determined not to return. Theres also a very negative trend of elderly parents being left alone by their children employed in foreign countries. Or after marriage they settle far from their parents; children and parents have weak relationships. As a result, the elderly are rendered helpless and lonely. Professor
Amarasekara opined.

Wijeyadasa blasts MP Ashu for criticising monks
	
Justice and Buddha Sasana Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe hit out at Government MP Ashu Marasinghe describing him as a NGO write-off, who entered Parliament on the national list with no voter base. He said Mr. Marasinghe was attempting to erode the Sinhala Buddhist vote base of the United National Party (UNP) by criticising Buddhist monks.
The minister said this MP had referred to his meeting with Buddhist monks as an interaction with men in robes.
Individuals without any standing can refer to monks disrespectfully as men in robes. But, we cannot do it, he said. (Kelum Bandara)

Achieved many, but much needs to be done- Ranil
	
While claiming that during the last two years, many milestones have been achieved as a country, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in his New Year message said  yet undoubtedly, much needs to be done in our pursuit to be a fully-fledged democracy that is also economically sound and socially empowered.
The abolition of the 18th Amendment which cast a shadow of dictatorship and suppressed democracy has been one of our greatest achievements during these two years. We have also been able to transform the perceptions the international community held with regard to Sri Lanka, enabling the country to build strategic relationships with other countries, he said.
The Premier also said that dealing effectively with crimes against humanity, halting the wastage of public funds, minimizing corruption, establishing relevant commissions, finalizing the right to information act, ensuring freedom for all, easing the cost of living as loans overburden the economy, creating political stability while laying the foundation for economic development are among the achievements of the Government during these two years.
As economic activity increases under Good Governance towards making Sri Lanka a viable destination, the Government is focused on empowering the people while encouraging co-existence and harmony between all communities, the statement said.
He said that in the same vein, the Government seeks the co-operation of all Sri Lankans in defeating agendas that are aimed at disrupting Sri Lanka's course set for success.
Let this New Year be the one to usher in greater change, a greater vision and prosperity to all Sri Lankans, the message concluded.

Indian, Sri Lankan fisheries officials meet ahead of ministerial talks
	
Secretaries to the Ministries of Fisheries of Sri Lanka and India met in New Delhi today to discuss the fishing issue bedeviling relations between the two countries.
On January 2, the Agriculture cum Fisheries Minister of India, Radha Mohan Singh, and the Fisheries Minister of Sri Lanka Mahinda Amaraweera, will meet in Colombo to carry forward the decisions taken at the Secretary-level talks.
Officials described the New Delhi talks as the first meeting of the Joint Working Group on Fisheries (JWGF) which was set up when the Foreign Ministers of the two countries met in New Delhi in October.
The JWGF consists only of civil and military officials of Sri Lanka and India. It does not have representatives of the Tamil Nadu government or the fishermen of the two countries. 
Among the main issues to be discussed in these two meetings are: measures to prevent Indian fishermen from crossing the International Maritime Boundary Line (IMBL) to poach in Sri Lankan waters; the release of fishermen and boats detained in Sri Lanka; and the joint preservation and development of resources in the sea between the two countries. 
Sri Lankan Minister Amaraweera has said that the island nation loses LKR 9 billion a year due to poaching by Tamil Nadu fishermen, and to prevent this, his government plans to slap a heavy fine on poachers. He had said that he would slap a fine of LKR 150 million or INR 7 crore per vessel.
In a recent press conference earlier this week, Amaraweera justified the non-release of detained Indian boats saying that the policy of impounding of boats and not releasing them has reduced poaching.
The Secretary to the Sri Lankan Fisheries Ministry, W.M.M.R.Adikari, told Express that the draft law to regulate fishing does not mention the quantum of punishment to be meted out to poachers but the fine will be heavy enough to be a deterrent.
During the October meeting between the Foreign Ministers, India, for the first, agreed to consider joint Indo-Sri Lankan naval patrolling of the IMBL. The reconstituted JWGF has representatives of the navies and coast guards of the two countries.
This means that India is ready to prevent encroachment of Sri Lankan waters by force if necessary  something it has been reluctant to do fearing a political backlash in Tamil Nadu where all political parties blindly support the fishermens traditional right to fish in Palk Strait and Palk Bay or at least around Kachchativu island, half way down to Sri Lanka.
As on date there are 111 Tamil Nadu boats and 51 fishermen in custody in Sri Lankas Northern Province. The figures will be slightly higher if detentions in other parts of Sri Lanka are included. (Indian Express)

Lesters Rekava was the first Sinhala film to compete at The Cannes film festival
	
Sinhala Cinemas line of destiny re-drawn by Rekava60 years ago - 2


By D. B. S. Jeyaraj
Rekava(line of Destiny) directed by Lester James Peris premiered 60 years ago at the Regal Theatre in Colombo on December 28th 1956. It was a path-breaking venture in Sinhala cinema that notched many firsts. Among these was the singular honour of being the first Sinhala film to compete for the Palme dOr best film award at the prestigious Cannes Film festival in France. Rekava was screened by invitation at the 10th film festival held in Cannes from May 2 -17, 1957. Rekava dubbed in English as line of destiny did not win but Lester James Peries won significant fame for Sri Lanka known as Ceylon then by placing Sinhala cinema on the global movie map for the first time.
Though Rekava is acknowledged widely as a pioneering venture with many firsts to its credit, not all the laurels heaped upon it are totally accurate. For instance it is stated by many that Rekava was the first Sinhala film to be shot outside studios entirely on location and that dialogues were recorded on the spot. It is also said that Rekava was the first Sinhala movie to be filmed in Sri Lanka alone. Both these assertions are only partially correct. 
The first Sinhala film to be shot on locations entirely outside a studio was Gambada Sundarimade in 1950 by Prasad Studios productions and directed by George S.Wijegunaratne. The film was first shot on 16 mm film using an Auricon sound on film camera which recorded sound optically on film. The 16 mm film was later blown up to 35 mm and screened on January 27, 1950 at Crown theatre in Colombo. Cinematography was by Leslie Pedris while music was composed by N.K.Kariyawasam. The main actors were Sheela Peiris, Kingsley Jayasekara and E.C. Bulathsinhala.The film was shown along with a documentary in colour on the Esala perahera. It appears that only one 35mm copy of the film was made which of course is now unavailable.
Another point made in praise of Rekava is that the film was the first movie to be filmed entirely in Sri Lanka. Earlier Sinhala films were either wholly or partially shot in India. While Rekava was definitely shot entirely in Sri Lanka. It was certainly not the first movie to be so filmed. The first Sinhala movie to be filmed completely in Sri Lanka was Banda Nagarayata Pemineema (Banda comes to town) produced in 1952 by S.M.Nayagam. It was Nayagam who made cinematic history by producing the first Sinhala talkie Kadawunu Poronduwa (Broken Promise) in 1947.
S.M.Nayagam who had filmed Broken Promise and other films through his production company Chitrakala Movietone at his studio in Madurai in India had later acquired land in Kandana and constructed the Sri Murugan Nava Kala studio which later became known as SPM studios. Banda Comes to Town was the first film made by Nayagam in his Kandana studio. It was directed by Raja Wahab Kashmiri an Indian national. It was co-directed by A.B. Raj, the father of popular Tamil Nadu actress Saranya who excels in maternal roles. Among the actors were Bernard Perera, Hugo Fernando, Joseph Seneviratne, Nanda Leelanayake and Malini Ranasinghe. The film was released on May 4, 1952 at the Elphinstone in Colombo and other outstation theatres.

Theme, content,style and impact
It could be seen therefore that Rekava was neither the first Sinhala film to be shot outside studios on location nor the first to be filmed entirely in Sri Lanka. It was however the first Sinhala feature film to be both shot on location outside studios and filmed entirely in the Island. More important than these technicalities was the contribution made by Rekava to enhance Sinhala cinema and take it in a new direction via theme, content, style and impact. Moreover, Rekava brought fame to the then Ceylon by becoming the first Sinhala film to compete by invitation at the famous Cannes film festival. The road to Cannes for Rekava was an arduous and hectic journey worthy of re-relating 60 years later.
As stated earlier there were two locations for filming Rekava, one in the up country and the other in the low country. Shooting began first at a location in Bandarawela. W.T. Keble, the legendary founding headmaster of St. Thomas Prep school in Kollupitiya was later the founder - headmaster of St. Thomas School in Bandarawela as well. Keble persuaded Lester James Peris to film in Bandarawela, guaranteeing that there would be no rain during that period on the basis of statistics compiled by him for the past 20 years. Statistics indicated there was no rainfall during the specified period for the past eight years. So the film unit went to Bandarawela.
There were only two boarding houses in the area. The entire unit was housed there amidst cramped conditions. Meals were supplied from a Chinese restaurant. The surroundings were scenic with a long winding road, grasslands, striking trees and a mountain in the backdrop. Shooting began and the opening sequences were filmed.
Scenes of Sena and his friends and the virindhu song sung by Ivor Dennis for the stilt walker Miguel played by Sesha Palihakkara and the antics of his monkey were filmed to a great extent in the first few days. And then it began raining, raining, raining! It rained consecutively for 22 days!
Days passed and nothing could be done. Keble who had guaranteed it would not rain avoided Lester in embarrassment. Making matters worse was the behaviour of the monkey that accompanied the stilt walker and performed tricks. The monkey trainer got one bottle of arrack and gave the monkey half-a-bottle each day. Denied its daily quota due to rain, the monkey threw tantrums, biting crew members and defecating in the Bug Fiat car used for transporting it. As the pouring rain continued without abating, Lester thought of utilizing the opportunity by shooting the final sequence that required heavy rainfall. So the cast needed for the final sequences including Winston Serasinghe were brought to Bandarawela for filming in the rain. What happened next was that the rains suddenly ceased and the sun began shining brightly, making the cast brought for the rain sequence redundant. According to Lester, the Chinese restaurant proprietor had chortled, Lain, lain no shooting; sun, sun no shooting. The weather gods had a hearty laugh at the expense of Chitra Lanka. The unit shot a few sunny scenes and returned after wasting more than 20 days.

Wewala village close to Alawwa
The second location chosen was a village called Wewala close to Alawwa. Lester was familiar with the place having filmed some scenes there earlier for the GFU. The crew and cast went to Wewala and lived there with the villagers in village homes. Lester, Willie and Titus shared one small room in a local house. The young men in the crew and cast were under strict orders not to have any romances with the village damsels. This was adhered to. So much so that when the shooting ended, an elderly village woman was to complain that the crew was departing after staying in the village for nine months without leaving a single memento behind
The unit spent more than eight months shooting at Wewala and nearby places. The shooting schedule went awry when a chicken pox epidemic erupted, afflicting the villagers and the cast and crew including Lester. Many in the village became critical grumbling that the bioscope karayas had brought a curse upon the village just as the villagers in the film story accused the boy Sena of bringing bad luck to the village. Two whole months of shooting were lost due to chicken pox.
Since this was Lesters first attempt at making a feature and because the concept of location shooting was something novel, the film making became a trial and error exercise. The weather was fine most of the time in Wewala but the problem was the overwhelming presence of crows and the sounds they made. The mikes picked up all outside sound. The track had to be transferred regularly from magnetic to optical and sent to India for processing. A sound recording technician from Madras (now Chennai) N.B.S. Mani had been enlisted. There was no post-synching facility on location in those days. Thus Lester could not take any chances and had to shoot more than 120,000 feet of film. Nowadays of course celluloid has given way to the digital image.
Another remarkable feature of Rekava was the music score and songs. When Lester was living in London he had heard the Lankan singer Hubert Rajapaksa sing Sunil Santas immortal composition Olu Pipila in a concert held at the Wigmore hall. This was in 1949. The song had a great impact on the young Lankan living in London. Years later, Lester was to recount the experience to writer-director Tissa Abeysekara. It was a call from home and something responded from deep within my conscience said Lester to Tissa.

Sunil SanthasOlu Pipila
After listening to the Olu Pipila rendition by Hubert Rajapaksa at Wigmore Hall the highly impressed Lester had inquired about the song and was told that the composition was by Sunil Santa.
Apparently Lester resolved then that he must get hold of Sunil Santa if and when he made a film. So when Lester embarked upon Rekava it was Sunil Santa that he approached to compose the music. Catholic Priest, Rev. Fr. Marceline Jayakody, also known as the Pansale Piyathuma, wrote the lyrics. Sunil Santha refused at first to compose music for a film. Lester enlisted Fr. Jayakody in his effort to make Sunil agree. Finally Sunil Santha consented with some conditions. He composed the melodies and musical score but got music director B.S. Perera to conduct the orchestra with K.A. Dayaratne as the music arranger.
The singers were Indrani Wijebandara, Sisira Senarathne, Latha Walpola, Ivor Dennis and Tilakasiri Fernando. Subsequently Indrani and Sisira got married. The song sequences in Rekava are fabulous thanks to the lyrics of Fr. Marceline Jayakody, the music of Sunil Shantha and the renditions by the respective singers. The picturisation of songs by Lester was enhanced by the striking camera work of Wille Blake. Olu Nelum Neriya Rangala (Sisira), Sudu Sanda Eliye (Indrani), Mini Muthu (Tilakasiri), Sigiri Landakage (Latha), Anurapura Polonnaruwe (Ivor) and Wesak Kekulu (Indrani) were all great hits.
So too was the classic theme music composed for the showing of titles and opening scenes. Willie Blake brought out the pastoral beauty of the rural hinterland through his expressive cinematography and one cannot but help recalling Mahatma Gandhis saying about India living in her villages.
There was also the striking contrast between the songs Olu Nelum by Sisira and Mini Muthu by Tilakasiri and the manner of picturisation. Olu Nelum is a joyful song brimming with the zest for life as the boatman goes along with the flow of water against a background of scenic loveliness. Mini Muthu on the other hand is a sorrowful song with melancholy tones set against a bleak desolate landscape caused by the drought. The virindhu song by Ivor Dennis picturised on Sesha Palihakkara and the children is another number lingering in memory. Thanks to YouTube one is able to view and hear these songs again and again.
One of the difficulties Lester had in filming Rekava was to make the actors influenced heavily by the stage and melodramatic films break out from that mould and act naturally. They were asked to speak normally as in everyday life instead of adopting stylized diction and intonation along with sweeping mannerisms. As shooting progressed, more and more colloquial speech was introduced into the script written by K. A.W. Perera on the instructions of Lester. Actors were also made to adopt silence at times and convey emotions through expressions or lack of expressions. Ironically the problem of sound recording on location compelled Lester to ask actors to speak out aloud at times.

Thespian Gamini Fonsekas entry
At one stage, Chitra Lanka exceeded the budget allocated for Rekava. Additional finance was procured from Ceylon Theatres who distributed the film after Sir Chittambalam Gardiner and Lady Gardiner viewed some of the reels. The main editing was done in Sirisena Wimalaweeras Navajeewana studio in Kiribathgoda by Titus Thotawatte, who is credited in the film as Editor under his original name Titus de Silva. Titus however served in many capacities as an assistant director. Incidentally, the great thespian Gamini Fonsekas entry into the film world was also through Rekava.
Sinhala cinemas first super star Gamini Fonseka made his screen debut in Rekava. It was Lester James Peries who gave Gamini his first break in movies through his path-breaking film. Gamini showed his face for the first time on screen in a scene in the film. He was working as a camera cum production assistant then for Lester. The man who introduced Gamini to Lester was Premnath Moraes, the man of multiple talents. Premnath Moraes was a journalist, writer, poet, lyricist, actor, director, commentator and a silver-tongued orator. He had worked with Lester on Rekava and later quit but maintained friendly relations with the director. It was Premnath who sent Gamini Fonseka to Lester James Peries with a letter of introduction.
Responding positively to Premnaths recommendation, Lester took Gamini on as a camera assistant to ace cinematographer Willie Blake. Rekava was being filmed then. It was being shot at Wewala near Alawwa. Gamini stayed with Justin, another camera assistant. Shooting went on for six days a week. Only Sunday was rest day. On Saturdays, Justin went to Ja-ela and brought pork. Gamini and Justin cooked it and entertained the trio of Lester, Willie and Editor Titus for a spirited dinner.
Despite the Saturday night bonhomie over a pork dinner, Willie Blake and Gamini Fonseka did not hit it off well while working. The quick-tempered Blake would lose his cool frequently. The youthful Gamini would not take the outbursts lightly. There were regular verbal duels. After about a month, Gamini thought of calling it quits and informed Lester. By now the director had realised Gaminis potential and did not want to let go of him.
Lester sounded out the production manager, Dan Dorairaj who was more than happy to take Gamini on board. So now Gamini was a production assistant. His chief responsibility was to ferry the artistes and crew from wherever they were staying to the shooting location in the morning and bring them back in the evening. While doing so, Gamini also assisted both the director and editor at times.
It was while the film was being shot that Gamini Fonseka got a chance to be an actor. According to the script, the boy Sena played by Somapala Dharmapriya was said to have healing powers. There were scenes where afflicted people came to be cured. Due to some reason Gamini had not shaven for a few days and had stubble. Deciding to shave it off on location, Gamini hung a small mirror on a tree and took out a razor when Lester passing by told him not to shave. Gamini, dont shave today. We have to shoot sick patients and with that growth you look like a sick man, Lester said. Thus Gamini faced the camera for the first time as a patient with a towel around his neck seeking a cure from Sena. Later in another shot he was a part of a crowd but the camera did not focus on him.

David Leans Bridge on the River Kwai
While Rekava was being filmed, there arrived in the island, David Lean to film the classic Bridge on the River Kwai. Lester met and interacted with the illustrious filmmaker through the good offices of Sarath Wijesinha, the premier financier of Rekava. When the shooting of Rekava ended, four crew members got an opportunity to work for David Lean thanks to being recommended by Lester.
They were Dan Dorairaj, Sesha Palihakkara, Wijaya Abeydeva and Gamini Fonseka. Dorairaj was taken into the Transport Dept. while Palihakkara was put in the makeup section. Abeydeva and Fonseka were assigned to the local assistant directors dept. All four were provided with accommodation, transport, food and a daily stipend while shooting went on in Kitulgala. The stint at Kitulgala made possible by Lester was a tremendous experience for Gamini. He moved easily with the Western personnel and established firm friendships with some.
Interestingly enough, the famous director Sir David Lean who arrived in Sri Lanka to shoot Bridge on the River Kwai was the man who helped Lester shoot the rain scenes for Rekava. When the making of Rekava was in progress, Lester had a dinner meeting with Lean at the Chinese Dragon cafe in Colombo. While conversing, Lester told David Lean that he was waiting for rain to shoot the final sequences. The British Director had laughed out loud, telling Lester not to wait for rain but to go ahead and make rain with the help of the Fire Brigade. Lean also delegated one of his special effects assistants to help out. The services of the Colombo Fire Brigade were obtained. Since large volumes of water were required, the rain scene was shot in an estate belonging to J.R. Jayawardene in Kelaniya adjoining the Kelani Ganga. The fire engines pumped in the water from the river and sprayed it upwards to a height of over 60 feet using a special kind of nozzle called the London nozzle. About half-a-dozen cars flashed their headlights constantly to provide light as the shooting went on from midnight to dawn. The monsoon rain sequence was very well shown in Rekava and forms an integral component of the film narrative.

Elphinstone and Roxy Theatres
As stated earlier, Rekava premiered to an invited audience at Regal Cinema on December 28, 1956. Thereafter it was screened in 16 theatres, including Elphinstone and Roxy Theatres in Colombo. The initial reviews particularly in the English media were complimentary. The film evoked great expectations and ran well for the first week. Audiences began to dwindle from in the second week and drop drastically in the third week. Rekava had flopped financially.The public mood had changed soon as this realistic film disappointed fans used to seeing melodramatic films of the formula variety. Also sections of the Sinhala media turned hostile to Rekava and conducted an anti-Rekava campaign.
Apparently there were two reasons for this. It was Regi Siriwardena who told me about these matters vividly in a lengthy conversation many years ago at the International Centre for Ethnic Studies (ICES) where both of us were working at that time. What Regi said in essence was this: Though Rekava was shot in a village and depicted rural life realistically, the film went against the popular romanticisation of the village and shattered illusions about rural innocence and purity. Rekava showed attributes of deceit, selfishness and cunning among village characters. It also demonstrated the extent of superstition and irrationality prevalent. This went against the popular conceptualization of the village and village life. Thus sections of the Sinhala media turned against Lester saying he was Westernized and a Catholic, who could not comprehend the sanctity of apey gama. The second reason for hostility according to Regi was the caste factor. Hard as it is to believe in the current context, a groundswell of resentment had gained ground then in certain quarters on account of caste. A horrible whisper campaign gathered momentum that Rekawa was a Karawe caste conspiracy. It was pointed out that a number of people involved in the film like Lester, Christopher Peries, Rev. Fr. Marceline Jayakody, Sunil Santha, Romulus de Silva etc., were of that caste. It was even alleged that Rekawa and Karawe had the same six letters from the alphabet, which indicated a hidden meaning.
Interestingly, Lester in an interview given to Kumar de Silva alludes to this by relating an anecdote where Winston Serasinghe (not a Karawe) was faulted by friends at CR and FC for getting trapped into a Kay conspiracy.
The end result of these hostile campaigns and the sense of disappointment felt by audiences used to a different type of cinema resulted in Rekava becoming a financial flop in its initial run. Lester himself tells the story of how he went incognito to Elphinstone to see audience reactions. The film goers were very angry at the unconventional film and one was heard to remark that instead of wasting money for this cinema ticket bread could have been bought and given to crows.

Austrian-born German Filmstar Maria Schell
What really helped Rekava, was an unexpected windfall. Austrian-born German film actress Maria Schell (sister of Oscar winner Maximilan Schell) was in Colombo for a vacation at the time Rekava was screened. She was staying at the Mt. Lavinia Hotel. Maria had wanted to see a Sinhala film and her guide had taken her to see Rekava at the Roxy. Maria loved the film and said so in an interview to the Observer. She stated in the interview that she would recommend Rekava to be screened at the prestigious Cannes film festival. Maria Schell kept her word and soon there was an invitation from the Cannes festival organizers. There was once again a hitch. Opposition built up that a negative film like Rekava portraying the villages of the country in a bad light should not be allowed to go to Cannes. The Education and Cultural Affairs Minister of the time Dr. W. Dahanayke said: You cannot send a film like Rekava where there are bad people. You must make films where village people are shown as paragons of virtue and can do no wrong.
Fortunately for Lester, Paul Bowles, a celebrated American author and composer was in the island at that time and wrote to the Minister criticising him on account of blocking Rekava. Bowles wrote that it was unbelievable that the Minister thought Western audiences were nave to believe that everybody was good in the villages.
The Government relented and Rekava went to Cannes. The good Samaritans who made this happen were two Westerners whom Lester had never met. Both Maria Schell and Paul Bowles had been impressed by the film and had no connection to Lester personally. It was their action that helped Rekava to go to Cannes.

10th Cannes Film Festival in May 1957
Lester along with Titus went first to London and edited the film again with sub -titles. The length was whittled down to 89 minutes.Thereafter they went to France with Rekava to screen the film at the 10th Cannes film festival in May 1957. The films screened for the best feature film competition were  The Bachelor Party by Delbert Mann, Betrogen bis zum jngsten Tag by Kurt Jung-Alsen, La Casa del ngel by Leopoldo Torre Nilsson, Celui qui doit mourir by Jules Dassin, Dolina miru by France tiglic, Don Kikhot by Grigori Kozintsev, Elokuu by Matti Kassila, Faustina by Jos Luis Senz de Heredia, Friendly Persuasion by William Wyler, Funny Face by Stanley Donen, Gotoma the Buddha by Rajbans Khanna, Guendalina by Alberto Lattuada, High Tide at Noon by Philip Leacock, Ila Ayn by Georges Nasser, Kanal by Andrzej Wajda, Kome by Tadashi Imai, Kt valloms by Mrton Keleti, La Moara cu noroc by Victor Iliu, Le notti di Cabiria by Federico Fellini, Qivitoq by Erik Balling, Rekava by Lester James Peries, Rose Bernd by Wolfgang Staudte, Same Jakki by Per Hst, Shiroi sanmyaku by Sadao Imamura, Sissi  Die junge Kaiserin by Ernst Marischka, Det sjunde inseglet by Ingmar Bergman, Sorok pervyy by Grigori Chukhrai, Un condamn  mort sest chapp ou Le vent souffle o il veut by Robert Bresson, Yangtse Incident by Michael Anderson, Zemya by Zahari Zhandov and Ztracenci by Milo Makovec.
The Jury at the 10th Cannes Festival were Andr Maurois (France) (president)Jean Cocteau (France) (honorary president), Maurice Genevoix (France), Georges Huisman (France) (historian), Maurice Lehmann (France), Marcel Pagnol (France),Michael Powell (UK),Jules Romains (France), Dolores del Ro (Mexico), George Stevens (USA)and Vladimir Volchek (Czechoslovakia) Despite the participation of trail blazing directors like Ingmar Bergman, Federico Felleni, Robert Bresson, Sadao Imamura, Stanley Donen and by Andrzej Wajda the coveted Palme dOr went to Friendly Persuasion made by American filmmaker William Wyler in a highly contested controversial decision. The Special Jury prize was jointly awarded to Swedens Ingmar Bergman for The Seventh seal and Polands Andrzej Wajda for Kanal. The best director award was won by Robert Bresson of France for A man escaped.
Rekava, the first Sri Lankan film to be shown at Cannes, did not win any award but for Lester  down in the doldrums after the film flopped  it was a morale booster. The film was received well and exhibitors bought screen rights for the Soviet Union, Poland, Germany, France and Britain.This international recognition had a positive impact back home. The film was again screened at outstation theatres for few days at a time. Those days it was customary for cinema theatres to screen old Sinhala and Tamil films between the screening of new films. There were some theatres which screened only old films for two days at a time. Rekava got gradually popularised in this way. I too saw Rekava on screen for the first time at a theatre in Kurunegala in my early twenties.
Rekava is now celebrated as one of Lesters three best films along with Gamperaliya and Nidhanaya. Lester James Peries with his Rekava is seen as a path-breaker in Sinhala cinema as Ediriweera Sarachchandra is seen with Maname in Sinhala drama. Rekava and Maname were screened and staged in the watershed year of 1956.

Lester-Sumitra Line of Destiny
As stated earlier, the fate of Rekava and its maker may have been different if not for the chance for the film to be screened at the Cannes festival. It was that recognition which paved the way for a Rekava renaissance. Cannes proved to be the line of destiny in Lesters life in another sense too. It was enroute to Cannes via Paris that Lester met his wife Sumitra Peries nee Gunawardena for the first time in the city of light. The couple who married in 1964 celebrated their golden anniversary in 2014. That truly was for Lester and Sumitra their line of destiny!

President assures UNP MPs govt. will serve full term
	
President Maithripala Sirisena has reportedly assured a group of UNP back bench MPs yesterday that he would see to it that the present government will continue to serve its full term despite differences between the two allies.
A UNP MP who did not wish to be named said the President made this assurance when the back benchers of his party met him at the Presidential Secretariat last evening.
The President said whatever issues between the two government allies could be resolved through dialogue, the MP said.
Referring to the resignation of State Minister of Local Government and Provincial Councils Piyankara Jayaratne, the President had told the UNP MPs that such issues would be resolved in due course.
The meeting between the President and the UNP back bench MPs took place just one day after some of MPs charged that a handful of ministers and the joint opposition were trying to sabotage the development programmes of the government. (Yohan Perera)
