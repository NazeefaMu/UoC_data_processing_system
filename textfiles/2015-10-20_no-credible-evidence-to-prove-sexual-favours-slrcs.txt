The Sri Lanka Red Cross Society today said that no credible evidence to support the claims that Sri Lanka Red Cross technical officer requested sexual favours for awarding Indian built houses in the north.
The SLRCS issuing its report on the incident said the panel did find that the allegations had an internal dimension which would be addressed in accordance with the constitution of the SLRCS.
“The Red Cross believes that it is vitally important to ensure transparency in responding to such a complaint. Despite the fact that no evidence was found from the inquiry to support the allegation that was leveled, under the instructions of the President of SLRCS, the report and documents from the inquiry was handed over to the Ministry of Law and Order and Prison Reforms on 20th October 2015, in the event that they decide to take the matter further,” it said.
