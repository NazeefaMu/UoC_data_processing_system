A PC member who was among the jostling crowd that gathered opposite the Colombo Chief Magistrate’s courts the other day to welcome a young Diyawanna member from a top political family released on bail, found to his consternation that someone had picked his purse containing Rs.38,000 and several important documents. 

 


The member had later got back the national identity card and other documents which he carried in his purse, but not the money.
