Disciplinary action will be taken against UNP parliamentarian Hirunika Premachandra if she is found guilty of being involved in the recent abduction drama, a senior minister said today.
Minister Kabir Hashim told a media briefing that the police have been given a free hand to investigate the matter.
“None of the government ministers had influenced nor will influence the police to stop any investigation in to the matter," he said.
When asked whether the UNP had the right to take disciplinary action, the minister said the party has that right because she contested as a member of the UNF.
“Let the police do their job first and then we will act if necessary," he said. “We did not send Ms. Premachandra to Singapore in a helicopter as the previous government sent a certain person abroad just after her father was killed," the minister added.
Meanwhile Minister Duminda Dissanayake said it was essential to determine whether the abduction was carried out by the MP's supporters without her knowledge. He said that wrong doings by supporters of a politician was often blamed on the politician.
He said it was Ms. Premachandra who had handed over her supporters to the police. (Yohan Perera and Chaturanga Pradeep)
