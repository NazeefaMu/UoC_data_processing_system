PHU holds 'black' news conference


	

Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) General Secretary Udaya Gammanpila, who earlier requested the people to display black flags to oppose the actions of the government, today organised a ‘black’ news conference and said Sri Lanka was experiencing one of the darkest eras of its history under the reign of the present government.
The MP, along with other party officials, wore black clothes and held the weekly news briefing of the PHU in front of a black coloured banner at the party head office in Kotte.
“Instead of our usual colour white, we decided to wear black today to convey our objection to the administration of the government and so-called Yahapalanaya which commenced on January 8, last year. As soon as the President was appointed on January 8, he appointed the Prime Minister violating the Constitution. This is how the journey of the Yahapalanaya started,” he said.
He said the Central Bank Bond Sale issue which took place last year had caused the deflation of the Rupee and the Financial Crime Investigation Division (FCID) established by the government was similar to Adolf Hitler’s Gestapo.
MP Gammanpila said the underworld was also reviving its head again and the Colombo City had turned into a hell. He said the government was protecting MP Hirunika Premachandra, who was allegedly linked with an abduction incident at Dematagoda.
“These are a few unwise and harmful actions and behaviour of the government and this is why we request the people to hoist black flags to convey their objection to the government. We don’t want to rebel to topple the government, we simply want to get it on the correct path. If it failed, we will topple the government,” he said.  (Lahiru Pothmulla)
