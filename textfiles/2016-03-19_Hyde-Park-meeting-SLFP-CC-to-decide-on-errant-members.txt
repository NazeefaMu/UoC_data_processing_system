The SLFP Central Committee (CC) will meet shortly to decide on the action to be taken against SLFP parliamentarians who participated in Thursday’s joint opposition rally at Hyde Park, General Secretary and Agriculture Minister Duminda Dissanayaka said yesterday.

He said the SLFP did not take decisions arbitrarily and individually and the issue of taking part in the joint opposition rally would be taken up at the next CC meeting.

"We are not in a hurry to take disciplinary action against those who participated in this meeting, but will act in accordance with party guidelines and constitution. I have sent a letter to SLFP parliamentarians and provincial councillors, not to violate party discipline. We will take a decision in line with that directive,” he said.

When asked whether explanations would be called from errant members, the minister said it would be decided by the CC and that participating in a meeting would not be considered a big deal.

“However, the CC will review the situation, go through what has been said at the meeting and then decide whether there was a violation of party discipline by those who participated,” he said.

However, Social Empowerment and Welfare Minister S.B. Dissanayaka recently said that strict disciplinary action would be taken against SLFP members who participate in the joint opposition rally.

Former President, Kurunegala District Parliamentarian Mahinda Rajapaksa, former speaker Chamal Rajapaksa, former Ministers Bandula Gunawardana, Kumara Welgama, Pavithra Wanniarachchi, Mahinda Yapa Abeywardana, Mahindananda Aluthgamage, SLFP Colombo District Parliamentarian Udaya Gammanpila were among the SLFP frontliners who participated, and some of them addressed the meeting.(Sandun A Jayasekera)
