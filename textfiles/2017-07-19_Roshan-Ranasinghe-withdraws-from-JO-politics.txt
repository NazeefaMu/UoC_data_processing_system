Polonnaruwa District UPFA MP Roshan Ranasinghe today said he would withdraw from political activities of the Joint Opposition.

He said all future meetings and programmes of the Joint Opposition organised by him would be postponed indefinitely.

In a statement, he said his political policies will remain unchanged and added that he had to take the decision as some JO leaders were interfering in political activities in the district without his knowledge. (K.G. Karunaratne)
