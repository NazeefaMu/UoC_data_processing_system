She had turned a snob overnight


	

A story coming from Wayamba says how a better half of a Diyawanna member had given a female constituent a dressing-down for not addressing her as ‘madam’. 




The friendly voters had been in the habit of calling this Diyawanna member and his wife hailing from ordinary families in the area ‘Aiya’ and ‘Akka’ as villagers are wont to do. 


A woman who called at the residence of the member last week had called the member’s wife ‘Akka’ and the latter immediately taking offense at being addressed by the familiar term had pounced on the female voter, saying “When did I become your ‘akka’? You don’t have ‘akkas’ here. “Why can’t you call me ‘madam’”
