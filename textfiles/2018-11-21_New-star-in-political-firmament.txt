New star in political firmament?


	



 

There is a fair and lovely one very close to a political heavyweight. 

 


In fact, she brought fame to the country by winning a crown at a beauty contest the other day. Perhaps, due to her closeness to a leading politico, she has lately developed a yen to shine as a star in the political firmament as well.


She is said to be planning to make it to Diyawanna from the Gampaha district which had once turned another cutie into a lawmaker overnight. 


The lovely and fair one’s latest fancy has highly ruffled the political heavyweight who had been the power behind her meteoritic rise to fame.

However, she has already set her heart on entering the political arena with a big bang come hell or high water let alone a mentor’s objections, they say.
