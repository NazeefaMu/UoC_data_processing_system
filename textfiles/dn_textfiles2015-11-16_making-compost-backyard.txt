Making compost in the backyard

Some useful tips
* Touch the pile. If it is warm, your microbes are doing their job fine for you. If it is not warmer than temperature outside then feed kitchen waste and manure to the pile. It will increase decomposition.
* Keep the pile moist and not dry.
* Air is necessary for organisms working on your pile. Insert some tree branches in the pile so that they can be occasionally shaken to allow air circulation.
*Air and moisture are your pile's lifelines.
* If your pile is still not decomposing, then maybe you have added too much carbon and too little nitrogen
A better alternative and nature-friendly preference over chemical fertilizers is compost. Nutrient rich, black, soil-like matter otherwise referred to, as ‘black gold’ of the garden, compost is inexpensive and a great fertilizer for your plants. With a little time and effort, you can make your own compost in the backyard with wastes from the kitchen.
Benefits of compost
Compost improves the soil and in effect keeps your plants healthy. It improves soil structure, aeration, texture and its water retaining capability. Micro-organisms that feed on compost produce nitrogen, phosphorus and the likes, which enrich the soil. In essence, compost is not only a great fertilizer for the plant but also environment-friendly.
Making compost yourself
Any pile of waste organic matter will rot. But in order to produce good compost for your garden, follow these steps:
Get a bin. A compost bin can be of wood, cement, brick or plastic. Place the bin on a level, well-drained surface. A compost bin does not have a base. This allows earthworm and other micro-organisms to enter the bin from the soil and work on compost. Avoid wood bins that may be chemically treated to keep micro-organisms at bay.
To 25 parts carbon add one part nitrogen. Carbon-rich organic matters are brown coloured waste products that include hay, saw dust, old leaves, cardboard, newspaper and straw. Nitrogen-rich organic matters are green coloured products that include green grass, manure, coffee, weeds, and vegetable peels.
First, place around six inches of carbon-rich matter like hay, straw etc. Then top it with a three-inch layer of nitrogen-rich organic waste like vegetable scraps, manure etc. Water each layer in the bin. Add these layers alternately till it becomes say four to five feet high.
Shred all the waste that you dump in the pile as smaller the particles, faster will be its decomposition. Perhaps, a sample pile composition could be four parts of fruit and vegetable scraps, two parts of cow dung, one part of shredded paper, and one part dry leaves.
Protect the pile from rain. Cover the pile, as its contents must not become soggy. They must not be too dry either.
Be careful of what you add. Do not dump diseased or infected plants and vegetables as they may survive even in the bin. Meat, dairy products, bones and fish attract rodents and other undesired creatures to your bin. Also, dog, cat or pig feces should not be put in the pile. However, chicken or cow dung is beneficial in a compost bin. Refrain from adding chemically-treated plants from your garden.
Proper air and water assists decomposition. Keep the pile moist but not saturated in water. Also, using a shovel, turn the contents of the compost bin thoroughly. This will aerate its contents, prevent it from stinking and hasten decomposition. It is advisable to mix the compost once in one or two weeks. Under proper temperature and moisture conditions, earthworms and other microbes will do the decompostion or hard work for you.
In six months your compost will be ready. It must smell sweet like earth and should become dark and crumbly. Spread around two inches of it and till the soil until it mixes well. Though the compost is spread on the top layer of the soil, it releases nutrients to the layers lying underneath.
