Western Province Chief Minister Isura Devapriya said he would take over the Ministry of Health, which was under Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) Spokesman Nishantha Sri Warnasinghe after the budget submitted by him was defeated by 45 votes to 23 last Tuesday.
He said he made the decision according to the powers vested on him as the Chief Minister.
The subjects including Indigenous Medicine, Social Welfare, Probation and Child Care, Women's Affairs and Provincial Council Affairs, which are functioning under the Ministry of Health, will be temporarily taken over by Chief Minister Devapriya until a discussion with the Governor is held on the next steps on the minister portfolio.
“He had asked me to bear responsibility for his budget defeat. However, all the Provincial Councilors know what actually resulted the first ever budget defeat in the province.
“I had personally informed him of some of his weaknesses in serving in the post and working together with other Councilors,” he said.
Speaking on the allegations levelled on the Chief Minister by Warnasinghe, he said he never knelt before any Provincial Councilor and requested Warnasinghe to admit his defeat in a polite manner without insulting anyone.
He added that activities in the ministry would not get crippled due to the defeat as Warnasinghe claimed.(Piyumi Fonseka)
