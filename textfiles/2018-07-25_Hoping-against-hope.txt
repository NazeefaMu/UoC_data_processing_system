Hoping against hope?


	



 

The bulky and swarthy one who lost his portfolio due to his involvement in the bond scam is a never- say- ‘die’ character hoping to make a comeback with a big bang, they say. 

 


The man is said to be pressing the powers that be to restore him to his former glory citing numerous reasons why they should meet his demand. 


His main pillar of strength is his party. Long John is reportedly doing his best behind the scene to help his colleague to make an early comeback and in a message sent to Number One he had claimed that there would not have been a regime called ‘yahapalanaya’ today if there were no fighters like the swarthy one to form the vanguard of the struggle.


Meanwhile, the swarthy one had met Number One on the eve of the latter’s departure for Rome and managed to extract a promise from him to seriously consider his request on his return to the country.  No sooner had this bit of news reached two or three erstwhile   colleagues of the swarthy one, they had gone into a flurry of activity in a bid to reverse a possible move that could put the man back on the saddle. Meanwhile, the former strongman who got wise to the ongoing machinations against him, had given him a friendly call to him.


The former strongman who inquired after his health and conveyed his best wishes to him, they say.
