President Maithripala Sirisena is reported to have told political party representatives that he would not re-appoint UNP Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe as the Prime Minister.

He said this to the UNF representatives who met him, at his request, on Thursday evening to discuss the current political impasse.

The President indicated to them that another person should be nominated to the post instead of Mr. Wickremesinghe in the event Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa was unseated through a properly passed no-confidence motion against him. (Kelum Bandara)
