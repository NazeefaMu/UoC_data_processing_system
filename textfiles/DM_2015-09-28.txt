3-hour blackout; reason yet to be known  CEB
	
The Ceylon Electricity Board said that the exact reason for the three-hour island wide power failure last night is yet to be identified and the power supply to some areas in the country is being restored.
CEB Chairman Anura Wijepala said that there may be several reasons for the failure, among them were due to high voltage electricity supply to the main grid or tripping of transmission lines due to lightening.
We cannot come to a conclusion on the reasons as our officials are conducting investigations into the failure, the Chairman said.
"We will restore the electricity supply for the rest of the areas as soon as possible," he said. He also said that Power and Energy Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya had also asked for a report from the CEB on the islandwide electricity failure.
At around 11 pm last night, the country experienced a black-out and steps were taken to restore power by around 4 am today.

BASL together with SLJI & CAB organizes CITS awareness seminar
	
		 		 
		 
			
The Bar Association of Sri Lanka in collaboration with the Sri Lanka Judges Institute and the Clearing Association of Bankers will be presenting a seminar to further familiarize the Cheque Imaging & Truncation System (CITS).
Members of the judiciary will be among the principle invitees at the event, which will take place on the 3rd of October 2015 at the Kingsbury Hotel, Colombo with Lanka Clear as the platinum sponsor while the Transnational Group along with BC Computers (Pvt) Ltd play the role of gold sponsors of the event.
The Cheque Imaging & Truncation System was introduced in order to expedite the clearing system in the country.
The process of the CITS is such that instead of the submission of original documents, certified images could be forwarded for legal purposes, etc.
The CITS revolutionized the clearing system in Sri Lanka, mainly due to the switch from a virtual manual system to a technologically based system. However, the system seems to have achieved mixed results where there have been quite a number of instances in which the full effect of the new banking practices under the CIT scheme has not reached many sections of the legal profession and Courts.
This results in many people engaged in litigation connected with the clearance of cheques continue to make applications to Courts calling for documents under the previous clearing system and the ultimate result is the delay in the legal process.
The primary goal of this seminar is to promote awareness of the new practices adopted by the banking industry following the introduction of the Cheque Imaging and Truncation System.
The days events will begin at 9.30 am with the welcome address delivered by Geoffrey Alagaratnam P.C., President, The Bar Association of Sri Lanka followed by the theme speech by the CEO of Lanka Clear, Sunimal Weerasooriya.
A Speech on New banking practices will be presented by Jonathan Alles, Managing Director/CEO, Hatton National Bank PLC, which will precede the keynote address by K. Kanag-Isvaran Presidents Counsel.
The panel discussion will follow with respected members of the legal fraternity such as; Justice Suresh Chandra (Retired Judge of the Supreme Court), Justice K.T. Chitrasiri (Judge of the Court of Appeal), Justice D. S. C. Lekamwasam (Retired Judge of the Court of Appeal) and moderated by Maithri Wickremesinghe President Counsel. The days proceedings will end with fellowship among invitees and organizers.

Drop in demand likely cause of power outage: CEB
	
	The Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) said today the power outage experienced countrywide on Sunday night was caused by an increase in the power supply amid a major drop in the demand.
	The demand for power had dropped because of the prevailing wet weather conditions and the long weekend.
	The CEB said the maximum peak demand during night on an ordinary working day was about 2,100 MW and declining to about 1,100 MW after midnight. During weekends, the maximum peak demand at night was around 1,900 MW with the minimum demand around 950 MW.
	However, on this Sunday due to the Poya day and the long week-end and the prevailing bad weather conditions, the CEB said the total system demand has further decreased and it was around 1,775 MW during the night peak which is a significant reduction from the usual.
	Furthermore, around 00.53, the demand was further reduced to around 940MW which is very much less than the usual 1,100MW during midnight and was dropping further. It is strongly suspected that a rare unstable situation had arisen resulting in the power outage, the CEB said.
	It said technical investigations were being done to establish the exact cause of the incident.
	The CEB System Control Centre began restoration work immediately and full power was restored by Monday morning.

	Australian High Commissioner Robyn Mudie has confirmed today that the Australian Governments policy against maritime people smuggling is clear and unchanged  the way to Australia is closed.
	Australia, under new Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, remains committed to protecting its borders and will continue to stop anyone who attempts to come illegally by boat  regardless of where they are from.
	High Commissioner Mudie said that cooperation between Australia and Sri Lanka to counter people smuggling has never been stronger, and anyone who attempts to travel illegally by boat to Australia will be detected, intercepted and either returned safely to Sri Lanka or sent to a regional processing centre in Papua New Guinea or Nauru.
	The Prime Minister has also made it very clear that there will be no resettlement of the people on Manus and Nauru in Australia, Robyn Mudie said.
	Do not believe the lies of people smugglers, no one who travels illegally by boat will make Australia home.
	Referring to the recent Australian Government announcement that it will resettle refugees fleeing the conflict in Syria and Iraq, High Commissioner Mudie confirmed that this has no impact on Australias policy to stop people attempting to travel illegally by boat to Australia. Australia will only resettle those refugees who are registered by UNHCR and who are currently in Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey. These resettlement places will not be provided to anyone arriving in Australia illegally by boat.
	Effective action against people smuggling is in the interests of Australia and Sri Lanka, and our cooperation has saved lives by discouraging people from taking the dangerous boat journey to Australia.

PLC Fast Track business support loan for speedy success
	
		 		 
		 
			
Peoples Leasing & Finance PLC the non bank finance sector giant in Sri Lanka going from strength to strength introduced Fast Track short term loan scheme for businesses and individuals requiring urgent financial solutions. This tailor-made loan scheme is now revamped to serve PLC
customers better.
Fast Track loan scheme is designed to offer fast solutions to your day-to-day financial requirements including working capital needs. Under the Fast Track loan scheme a quick sum of money could be obtained at a minimal interest for business or individual requirements such as; expanding businesses, acquiring stocks needed for businesses, modify or adding extensions to houses, agricultural needs, to purchase lands, higher education and other business and personal
financial needs.
Movable or immovable assets could be kept as security to obtain a Fast Track loan. The maximum limit of the loan is decided upon the value of security kept and repayment capacity of the borrower. Unlike in leasing or personal loan facilities a Fast Track loan could be tailored according to the borrowers income. Further the customer could decide the loan settlement period according to his earnings. The total sum obtained could be settled with the due interest prior to the maximum loan period of two years without any surcharge.
Although the loan is given for a maximum of two year period, the borrower could request and renew the facility there onwards. The loan interest is calculated on only the outstanding capital thus a particular months payable interest becomes the due interest for that month. Lionel Fernando, DGM (Operations) PLC expressing his views on the fully fledged Fast Track loan scheme said this is a short-term loan scheme that facilitates urgent working capital needs as well as individual day-to-day needs of people.
Fast Track loan scheme was designed keeping in mind peoples urgent financial needs. The specialty here is the opportunity offered for customers to settle the loan without being pressurized or ending up with mental stress. The full loan amount could obtained at the inception itself or it could be obtained in installments according to the customers requirement and repayment capacity. Also he/she is offered with the opportunity for early settlement of loan without incurring any additional charges. Fast Track loan could be obtained speedily by producing a least set of documents. Individual, joint or corporate clients could apply under Fast Track loan scheme and the interest rate is a fixed one, said Fernando. PLC was incorporated in 1995 as a fully owned flagship subsidiary of the biggest state bank in Sri Lanka, Peoples Bank, and retained the market leader position for the past 13 consecutive years.

## Title: Strong investor confidence for Pan Asia Bank debenture issue

Strong investor confidence for Pan Asia Bank debenture issue
	
Bank gears up for Rs.100bn asset basePan Asia Banking Corporation PLC (Pan Asia Bank) last week saw its Rs.4 billion senior debenture issue being oversubscribed on the opening day itself, receiving applications for over Rs.5.5 billion.
The issue was rated BBB by Fitch Ratings Lanka.
This is the second such debenture the bank issued in a span of 12-months. Its Rs. 3 billion subordinated debenture issue in October 2014 was also oversubscribed on the opening day itself.
Pan Asia Banks Director and Chief Executive Officer, Dimantha N. Seneviratne speaking on the success of the debenture issue attributed the oversubscription to the continuous investor confidence in the bank and its improved performance.
In a brief interview, Seneviratne spoke of the banks plans to deploy these funds to finance the growth of the balance sheet and manage funding maturity profiles. He also spoke of Banks planned Corporate Campaign coinciding with Banks 20th Anniversary and other expansion initiatives in its goal to reach Rs 100 billion balance sheet. The following are the excerpts of the interview;How do you view the recent success of Pan Asia Banks debenture issue I believe it was a strong endorsement received from the wider investment community on the banks direction and the recent performance.
In recent times we have been growing at a rapid pace  our loan book growth has been above the industry average while our key performance indicators have strengthened  and the investors have recognised the potential of our performance.
Besides, the rates that we offered were very competitive and offered a choice between the fixed and floating rates and three and four year tenors. This enabled us to attract investors with different risk appetites.
On the other hand, our debenture was the first such corporate debt issuance in two months and I am sure, it offered a solid investment opportunity for the individual investors as well as large corporate institutions to lock-in their funds. From the markets point of view too, the oversubscription of our debenture was a significant feat and re-inforced the confidence of investors. The Banks management took a bold decision to go ahead with the debenture at a time when there was uncertainty about the movement in interest rates and we are confident that we made the right decision. We will lock in these funds soon to ensure any downside risks are mitigated.
How do you plan to deploy these funds
We have a pipe-line of lending proposals in the Retail, Corporate banking and, Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) segment and these funds would be deployed to continue our growth in assets.
This will lead to a well balanced growth in our balance sheet and maintain the quality of the asset portfolio. 
As mentioned earlier, our loan book grew by over 34 percent in FY 2014 and 14 percent in the first half of 2015. So, these funds too, will be used to expand our lending portfolio while minimizing some of the maturity mismatches in our assets and liability portfolios. The funds will also be utilized to stabilize our earnings stream and improve stock of liquid assets and government securities.
Just before the debenture was issued, Pan Asia Bank received some Dollar funding too. Can you shed some light in to this
Yes, we did complete a US $ 20 million re-financing line this month with the Global Climate Partnership Fund (GCPF), one of the largest green financiers based in Europe.
This is for the lending that the Bank has been providing in the sustainable energy sector.
This clearly demonstrates that, not just the local investors but also the larger foreign financing houses too are seeing the potential of investing in Pan Asia Bank.
If you look at the institutions that back the GCPF are the World Banks private sector financing arm, The International Finance Corporation (IFC), the German Federal Governments Development Bank, KfW Bankengruppe and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark.
In fact, the GCPF has expressed its willingness to extend the partnership with us and to provide much bigger refinancing facilities for green projects.Green lending in Sri Lanka is still in its infancy but this is a step in the right direction in our finance sector.  What more could your bank do to take the lead in promoting green lending in Sri Lanka
We are the pioneers in introducing green lending for the retail sector in Sri Lanka when we offered hybrid vehicle leasing and loans to finance solar panels at preferential interest rates in 2013. But now, as a matured and a bigger player, we have taken a broader perspective and are looking at funding much larger projects in the fields of renewable energy and energy efficiency. 
Currently we are looking at funding for hydro power projects and are also evaluating other renewable energy power generation projects.
Apart from the commercial value of these products, I believe this lending carries a much larger national significance, for through this lending, we help to create clean energy, clean air and a sustainable environment. This is also in line with our goals in corporate social responsibility, to contribute to climate friendly economic development. 
Further, we have ingrained the sustainability agenda in to our own business processes , loan evaluation and risk management process and have taken initiatives to reduce the Banks carbon foot print.
How did the bank perform in recent times; both financially and non-financially
During the first half of FY 2015, most of our performance indicators improved. The banks after tax profits increased by 156 percent to Rs. 451 million. This is higher than the after tax profit the bank recorded for the entire financial year of 2014 (i.e. Rs.415.2 million).
Apart from this, our biggest achievement was the doubling of our Return on Equity from 9.81 percent to 18.38 percent in a span of just six months.
We achieved this amidst the pressure on the net interest margin due to falling interest rates.
We managed to increase our efficiency by containing our cost-to-income ratio and gradually bringing it down to just below 54 percent. We have seen further improvements in this aspect.
Meanwhile, we doubled the Return on Assets from 0.58 percent to 1.11 percent during the same period.
It is also significant to mention that during this period we made substantial investment in a new core-banking system and a treasury platform to improve process efficiency and enhance the quality of delivery to provide a better service to our customers.
During the 18-months up to June 30, 2015, our balance sheet grew by 32 percent to Rs. 85.1 billion.
With the recent funding arrangements and current growth momentum, we are confident of reaching Rs.100 billion balance sheet in near future. 
In the meantime we continue to increase our footprint , last week we opened our 79thbranch in Nawala and branch expansion plans would continue.
Besides these financial achievements, we were also adjudged as the fastest growing commercial bank in Sri Lanka in 2014 by the United Kingdoms Global Banking and Financial Review.
Further, our groundbreaking lending product, Sammana  which was designed to provide access to finance to our pensioners and senior citizens  was awarded the most innovative product by a financial institution in Sri Lanka.What are your plans for the future of Pan Asia Bank
This year, Pan Asia Bank will be celebrating two decades of excellence in banking business in Sri Lanka. In order to coincide with the anniversary celebrations, we will be embarking on a brand building campaign and also reinforcing our customer centric approach.
Ability to understand customer requirements effectively and fulfilling them with an efficient and courteous service has always been our forte. Pan Asia Bank is also known for the innovative products that have been introduced to meet customer needs. Therefore in our branding efforts, we will be making use of those core strengths to differentiate Pan Asia Bank from the competition.
Another advantage of choosing this approach is that our staff and processes are already strongly aligned to deliver a superior service to our customers.
Last year, we developed a three-year strategic plan and the results that we have delivered so far in 2015, are in line with such plan.
We will also engage in some CSR initiatives to celebrate our 20th anniversary along with staff engagement activities. The key strength of the success of Pan Asia Bank has always been the commitment and dedication of our staff. Hence, I am confident that Pan Asia Bank is now poised for the next wave of growth to become a formidable player in the banking and financial sector in Sri Lanka.
