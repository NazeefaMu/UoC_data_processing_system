Daily Mail/15 December 2016   
Cyber-thieves have stolen personal data from one billion Yahoo customers - the biggest hack in history - and the internet giant took three years to realise.   


Yahoo has blamed ‘state-sponsored’ hackers for the August 2013 security breach and the stolen data is believed to include information for over 150,000 US government and military employees.   


Yahoo claims that its one billion users’ card details and bank account details are safe but refused to name the country behind it.   


The company has been heavily criticised by customers who are furious they didn’t discover the hack in 2013 and failed to tell them until yesterday.   


In September the company revealed 500 million accounts were breached, which until last night’s revelation was the previous biggest hack in history.
