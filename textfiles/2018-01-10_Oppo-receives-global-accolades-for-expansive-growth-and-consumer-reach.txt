Heralding further progress as a leading smartphone brand in the world, Oppo recorded two prestigious achievements during the final weeks of the year 2017.
While Oppo F5 claimed the number one spot in GSM Arena’s ‘Top 10 By Daily Interest’ smartphone chart for seven consecutive weeks, Oppo, the brand received the Canstar Blue Award 2017 for the Most Satisfied Customers - Smartphones.


“The Oppo F5 leaped straight to the top,” stated GSM Arena in its week 43 analysis. In the week 46 analysis, GSM Arena commented: “It was an eventful week in our Top 10 popularity chart, but the Oppo F5 still managed to weather the storm and come on top, extending its streak to four weeks.” The trend continued for seven consecutive weeks and by week 49, Oppo F5 was still leading the chart ahead of many global leading brands.


GSM Arena is renowned as the leading mobile site for best and most reliable on-line resource for information on mobile phone brands and the site is a sought after resource by millions of discerning users across the globe. “These global accolades honour us and provide an independent testimony for the growth we achieved during the year. Both GSM Arena and Canstar Blue base their rankings on consumer preference, appeal as well as the overall functionality of the devices. Since inception, we actively focused on catering to consumer requirements and we have been able to garner consumer appreciation and preference for the Oppo brand as a result,” commented Oppo Sri Lanka Chief Executive Officer Bob Li.


Oppo is an ever-evolving global smartphone brand dedicated to delivering customers with the most extraordinary experience through innovative technology, meticulous design and camera expertise. Since launching its first smartphone in 2011, Oppo has grown to become the fourth largest smartphone maker in the world and the go-to device for millions of consumers worldwide.

Speaking of Oppo’s rise to the top to claim the Most Satisfied Customers - Smartphones 2017 Canstar Blue award, Canstar Blue Editor Simon Downes said: “Lots of consumers are willing to try new things and those who move away from the tried and tested smartphones are usually pleased they did so. Oppo has performed extremely well in our review, up against stiff competition. Given the significant cost of new smartphones, to achieve five stars on value for money is an excellent achievement. Oppo users clearly think they’re onto a winner.”
