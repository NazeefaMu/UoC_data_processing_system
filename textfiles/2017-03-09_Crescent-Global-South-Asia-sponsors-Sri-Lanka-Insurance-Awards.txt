When the crème de la crème of the local insurance industry come together to meet the students who have won awards and obtained exam certificates from the Sri Lanka Insurance Institute, it creates a day to remember.  
This signature event was held at the Bishop’s College auditorium earlier this month and was exclusively sponsored by Crescent Global South Asia, part of Crescent Global Group, a Lloyd’s accredited insurance broker. 
Understanding the need for more qualified and recognized personnel in the insurance industry, Crescent Global Director Indrajith Fernando said his organisation takes a personal interest in the graduates of the Sri Lanka Insurance Institute. It is the only institution that produces the quality of individuals that the insurance industry in Sri Lanka so desperately needs, he said. 
Fernando went on to say that the insurance industry requires a special kind of individual as an industry practitioner. Insurance is an industry that is often misunderstood and is thought to thrive on people’s anxieties. It is up to the industry practitioners to help solve the misconceptions that clients and the general may have and the correct subject knowledge is very important for this cause. 
The chief guest, Dr. Jagath Alwis, said that this approach “requires a particular precision training and insurance industry captains have come to respect the Sri Lanka Insurance Institute, as it produces candidates who have the right attitudes and of course the right level of industry-based knowledge to drive the industry. We are committed to developing the Insurance Institute and to support in any way to further this cause.” 
Crescent Global South Asia operates in many countries across the region and understands the issues of both the local and global insurance industry like no other. When the Sri Lanka Insurance Institute, the industry educational body, was awarding its successful students, Crescent Global was delighted to partner the worthy cause, said Fernando.
The insurance business is expanding to such an extent that Fernando sees that there should be a new approach to training new recruits for the insurance business. He hopes that Crescent Global South Asia’s alliance with the Sri Lanka Insurance Institute will help the industry evolve and provide the highly skilled and knowledgeable individuals that the industry needs. 
“We are discussing and hoping to advance education further with Crescent by using the web-educate portal, which is owned by Crescent Global Group and provides 24/7 online insurance training. We have also agreed with Sri Lanka Insurance Institute to launch Merit scholarships and carrier guidance for the deserving in the industry, in memory of my late Father Aleric L. Fernando.”      
He believes that the institute works with the signal desire to produce the future leaders of the insurance industry. The institute also facilitates the special kind of learning that peers appreciate and the insurance industry elites desire, which is why when a cohort of insurance industry practitioners graduate from the institute, the mentors of the industry have great expectations for their future and as such they feel it is so important for them to be present at this event, for which Crescent Global is the sole principal sponsor. 
“This is a prestigious unique event of the Sri Lanka Insurance Institute and we wish to thank Crescent Global South Asia for their commitment to support. Sri Lanka Insurance Institute is the pioneer educational body in insurance education and we look forward to the support of all stakeholders to enhance the necessary talent for the industry,” Sri Lanka Insurance Institute President Thusitha Nandasiri said. 
Crescent Global’s headquarters is situated in the City of London, close to the most important insurance marketplace in the world, Lloyd’s of London. The business handled by the firm emanates from more than 50 countries, via its global office network. Crescent Global is a member of the Global Broker Network (GBN.)
