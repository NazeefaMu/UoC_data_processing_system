Over 130 golfers for Donald Steel tournament

 
Over 130 gentlemen and lady golfers from many countries will play in the 19th version of the Donald Steel Golf Championship organized by the Victoria Golf and Country Resort at the award winning Victoria golf course at Rajawella off Kandy on Saturday.
Speaking to the Daily News the General Manager of the Victoria Golf and Country Resort Neroy Marso said that this will be the first major golfing event at Victoria for 2016 and many more major events will follow during the course of the year which we have just ushered in.
He said that the golf course has been further upgraded with the installation of sprinklers on the fairways which has kept it green even during the driest of weather. The golf course is in such fine fettle that we once again won the award for the Best Golf Course in the Sub Continent for yet another year. This is something we have green winning regularly since it was inaugurated in the year 2002 by the Golfers Digest in Malaysia.
He said that it is fitting that we are as usual starting off with the Donald Steel Golf Championship as it was Donald Steel who was one time President of the United Kingdom Professional Golfers Union and an internationally reputed golf architect who designed this course on a 558 acres coconut plantation on the banks of the Victoria Reservoir which was impounded in 1983.
Golfers who will be taking the field will be from China, India, Pakistan, Malaysia, Singapore, Europe, Malaysia, England and Germany. The championship will be played for the Donald Steel Trophy and Eberts Pot for men and Pam Fernando Trophy and Victoria Bowl for the ladies. In addition to this there will be also side events such as nearest to the Pin and Longest Drive for men and ladies.
