This concert is organized with the aim of raising funds for development programmes to empower the underprivileged children.   

Wayo, Bathiya and Santhush (B&S), Chitral Chity Somapala, and Sanuka Wickramasinghe, are all much loved, familiar names from our local music industry who will be performing under one roof to satisfy all your musical yearnings.  

Wayo has left their mark in the local music industry since the band’s inception in 2012 establishing their own trademark of music ranging from a cocktail of alternate rock to fusion music. Their much loved songs “Api Kawuruda” and “Api Sanasille” have had us moving our feet to the lively beats and singing along with a rush of excitement on many an occasion. Chitral Somapala, Bathiya and Santhush (B&S) who are no strangers to Sri Lanka’s music scene will guarantee an evening filled with entertainment which is dedicated towards a noble cause of empowering underprivileged children.

IMCD is local voluntary organisation whose unwavering mission has been to uplift the livelihood of those from underprivileged communities in Sri Lanka, focusing on children and education by upholding the ethos, “from the society, to the society, with the society”. In carrying out their mission, IMCD has birthed several projects, each focused on addressing specific needs of those from the underprivileged communities.  

The IMCD project “Colour A Dream” focuses on identifying talented children who are fettered from their true potential due to financial constraints and granting them with scholarships. “Needy Readers”, is another innovative project by IMCD which predominantly focuses on providing books for schools without library facilities or libraries with limited resources. “Path to Wisdom” on the other hand, conducts examination focused seminars at central locations for selected schools with minimal resources to assist their students sitting for Advanced level, Ordinary level and Scholarship examinations. 

“My Dream School” aims to provide underprivileged schools with essential facilities. IMCD has also taken an initiative in changing the perspective of society regarding children and elders in homes, special needs children and patients suffering from cancer and Thalassemia and to help them develop their ability and build confidence in themselves through their project, “Amuzed”.
