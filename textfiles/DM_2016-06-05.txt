Bibile loyalists want to take Rajitha to court over NMRA decisions
	
Prof. Senaka Bibile Commemorative Association (SBCA) today said they would take legal action against Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne for allegedly sabotaging work of the National Medicinal Regulatory Authority (NMRA), in support of multinational pharmaceutical companies.
National Organiser of the SBCA Dr. Jayantha Bandara told a media briefing yesterday that they would file a case in court against the Health Minister for his actions, which he said had violated the terms of the National Medicines Regulatory Authority Act.
Two eminent medical professionals, Prof. Lal Jayakody, Head of the Department of Pharmacology at the Colombo University and Prof. Krishantha Weerasuriya, South Asian Drug Policy Advisor to the World Health Organisation, who were serving as the NMRAs Chairman and Chief Executive Officer respectively were asked to step down by the Health Minister.
He did so because the two medical professionals were a threat to multinational pharmaceutical companies, because they introduced new regulations to control the prices of medicine for the betterment of innocent patients, Dr. Bandara said.
He claimed that Professor of Clinical Pharmacology, Kelaniya University, Prof. Asitha De Silva, who is also a director of a multinational pharmaceutical company, was tipped to take office as Chairman of the NMRA, following the decision of the Health Minister.
Dr. Bandara said there was clear evidence to prove that Prof. Asitha De Silva dealt with a particular company, where he was holding a director post, during clinical trials of the Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Kelaniya University.
He said two more persons had been appointed to two sections of the NMRA, despite they are from fields different from the appointed sections. (Piyumi Fonseka)

Mahela, Atapattu among shortlist to become BCB HP Unit coach
	
Former Sri Lankan captains Mahela Jayawardene and Marvan Atapattu are leading contenders to become the coach of the BCB High Performance (HP) Unit, which is going to resume next month.
Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) vice-president Mahbubul Anam, who is also in charge of the HP Unit, informed that they have made a shortlist of three high profile names, and one of them could come Bangladesh to coach the HP Unit cricketers.
We have formed a three-man shortlist. Nothing has been finalized yet, but we are working on it, and hopefully we will reveal the name within a few days time, said Anam.
As per the words doing the rounds, Indias Robin Singh is also on the list. However, though it was earlier heard that Kumar Sangakkara was also amongst the three-shortlisted names, now it is understood that he is not among the BCB shortlist.
Meanwhile, Anam also added that Bangladesh national teams head coach Chandika Hathurusinghe will take the final decision as to who would become the new HP Unit coach. Even it is also up to him whether or not a number of discarded national cricketers would be called up to join the HP Unit camp.
According to the BCB high-up, the scheduled date for this years HP Unit camp to begin is July 10, which means after the Eid. However he also confirmed that a fitness camp would take place during the month of Ramadan.
Eight cricketers with suspect bowling action found in the Dhaka Premier Division Cricket League (DPL) will be eligible to be part of the four-month camp while the size of the squad is yet to be decided.
