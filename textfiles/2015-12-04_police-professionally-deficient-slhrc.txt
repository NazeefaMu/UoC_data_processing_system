In its report on the police assault on the students of the Higher National Diploma in Accountancy (HNDA) during a protest in Ward Place in October, the Sri Lanka Human Rights Commission (SLHRC) today recommended that the police should compensate those who were injured.
“The manner in which the police acted during the protest had demonstrated that they were riddled with several professional deficiencies,” the report stated.
SLHRC had concluded that according to the Constitution, the police had violated the students’ fundamental rights.
It also recommended that Sasini Sandeepani who was shown in photographs as being beaten by a policeman should be paid a compensation of Rs.25,000 by the Police.
It said the other eight students who were hospitalized with injuries suffered during the attack should also be paid a compensation of Rs.15,000 each. (Piyumi Fonseka)
