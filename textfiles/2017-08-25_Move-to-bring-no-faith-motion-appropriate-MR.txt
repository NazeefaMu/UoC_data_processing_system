Former president Mahinda Rajapaksa today said the move to bring a no-faith motion against Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne by the joint opposition was an appropriate move.

Mr. Rajapaksa told journalists that it was necessary to bring a no-faith motion against Minister Senaratne considering the prevailing circumstances.

“The people will understand the gravity of this issue when they go through the charges levelled against the minister in the no-faith motion,” he said. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)
