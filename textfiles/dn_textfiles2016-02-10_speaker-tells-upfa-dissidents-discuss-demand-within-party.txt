Speaker tells UPFA dissidents to discuss demand within party

Speaker Karu Jayasuriya yesterday in Parliament asked the UPFA dissidents in the Opposition to first discuss their demand to be recognized as an independent group within their party and inform him of the decision reached, observing that it is a domestic issue. He said that he could not lay his hands to the sin of breaking up the UPFA. He was responding to Point of Orders raised by MPs Wimal Weerawansa and Dinesh Gunawardena.
MPs Wimal Weerawansa and Dinesh Gunawardena asked the Speaker to give his final decision whether they would be recognised as a separate independent group in the opposition and if so, whether they would be granted their due privileges. They said the matter has been dragging on for over six months now without a solution.
They also pointed out to a letter signed by 52 joint opposition MPs that has been presented to the Speaker requesting to recognize them as an independent group. "Considering the numbers, our group has the highest number of MPs in the Opposition.
Moreover, unlike other parties in the opposition, we do not join in secret talks with the Government. We also made a request to the Opposition Leader," MP Gunawardena said.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe commenting on these concerns said there could only be one Opposition Leader and one Opposition in Parliament.
He observed there could not be a Constitutional Opposition and a so called joint opposition at the same time.
"The Speaker has already recognized the Opposition Leader and all in the Opposition should work accordingly.
"When we adopt the Parliamentary Oversight Committee system, we hope to get the active contribution of all. We will share the positions too. Let us solve this problem in consistent with the Constitution and Parliamentary traditions," he noted.
At this point, MP Bandula Gunawardena said that they do not demand to be recognized as a separate party, but as an independent group. Citing various examples from history, he said there had been a tradition of recognizing independent groups in Parliament.
The Prime Minister replying to this comment, observed that in 1989, a group of MPs including Gamini Dissanayake, was given separate time to talk because they were expelled from the party. "Now, let us know whether you are still a part of the SLFP or not. If you are not in the SLFP anymore, then the Speaker has a matter to solve" he said.
