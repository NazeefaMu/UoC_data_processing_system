Arpico Finance Company PLC relocated its Godagama branch to a prime location in Kottawa, Pannipitiya. 
The move was made with an objective of increasing accessibility and providing prompt and effective service to their customers. The new branch was ceremoniously inaugurated by the board of directors in a highly felicitated event recently. 
Over the past 65 years, the company has earned a loyal customer base through a range of personalized solutions in fixed deposits, leasing, hire purchase, business and personal loans, leasing, microfinancing and Islamic financing. 
Arpico Finance Company PLC was acquired by Associated Motor Finance Company PLC (AMF) in 2015 under the consolidation programme implemented by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka. As part of the AMF group, the company has adopted a restructured business model to achieve new financial goals and objectives and extend its presence into trade finance and real estate. 
Since its inception in 1951, it has contributed towards the country’s overall economic growth by supporting the development of every segment of society through numerous financial services. As the second oldest finance company in the island, it has gained a strong reputation for being a leading financial service provider and looks towards continuously maintaining the highest standard and quality of service it has retained over the past six decades.
