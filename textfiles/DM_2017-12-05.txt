Angry Sports Minister recalls nine ODI players from BIA
	
In an unprecedented development, Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekera last night ordered all nine players heading to India for the limited-over leg of the current series to turn back as they were leaving the country without his approval. At the time of his intervention, the players had even boarded the flight to Delhi and were forced to disembark.
The team leaving the country without his approval was a blatant violation of the countrys sports law which requires Sports Ministers approval, the Minister said. More...

As before -- Ambagamuwa PS will administer Sri Pada
	
Sri Pada will continue to remain within the Ratnapura District and under no circumstances would it be administered by the Nuwara Eliya District despite the carving out of three new pradeshiya sabhas from the Ambagamuwa PS, Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister Faizer Musthapha said.
He said under the new delimitation process, there was an unfounded belief that Sri Pada would come under the Nuwara-Eliya PS and thus a voter had filed a petition in the Court of Appeal on this matter.
The minister told the media that he would reveal the true position in the Appeal Court and vowed not to allow the LG polls be affected because of this case.
Mischievous elements are attempting to create a religious and ethnic tension using the delimitation process. The setting up of three pradeshia sabhas from the Ambagamuwa PS will not affect any of the religious or ethnic group, he said.
The minister said he would present another amendment to the Local Government Bodies Electoral (Amendment) Bill today in Parliament to remove certain discrepancies among the Sinhala, Tamil and English drafts of the Bill and would in no way affect the LG polls.
He said his ministry has become one of the most efficient and active ministries with Rs.22,164 million being spent on various development projects in the nine provinces. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

Clashes in Gintota -- I don't agree with IGP's statement: Sagala
	
Responding to a question asked in Parliament by Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake, Law and Order Minister Sagala Ratnayake said today he was unable to agree with the IGP's statement that the police had failed to stop the violence that erupted at Gintota recently.
"I don't know whether the IGP made such a statement, but if he did we cannot agree with it. The police and the security forces acted with responsibility to bring the situation in Gintota under control," the minister said.
He said as a long-term measure, an inter-religious committee would be set up in the area to maintain peace and harmony among all the ethnic and religious groups in Gintota.
Meanwhile, Mr. Dissanayake condemned the government's move to downsize the presence of security personnel in the area, at a time when it had been disclosed that a certain political group was attempting to create trouble by spreading hatred among ethnic and religious groups.
The minister said the security measures were eased because the ground situation in Gintota had improved. He said statements had been recorded from more than 134 people on the recent violence in Gintota and that arrangements had been made to provide relief to those who were affected by the clashes.

Fall of 'DALA POOTUWA'  Illegal ivory trade  calls for tighter laws and more vigilance
	

Elephants have begun to walk their path to extinction. Once a majestic being of the wild that every human feared could be shot dead in seconds today. With the recent killing of the Galgamuwa Dala Poottuwa and another tusker in Karuwalagaswewa, the greed for prestige and a few million bucks has clearly surfaced. 
According to legend, the first interaction of a man and an elephant in Sri Lanka dates back to the First Century BC which was recorded on an inscription in Navalar Kulam in Panama Pattu of the Eastern Province. The inscription mentions a religious benefaction by a prince who was designated by an AthAcharya or a Master of the Elephant Establishment. But with the introduction of peraheras (Pageants) during the Kandyan era, elephants became a symbol of prestige and fell prey to the elite. 
The human-elephant dealings lie on two extremes; the animals have been used during times of war by royal families or poached for their ivory. At present more elephants are killed than they are born and short term interventions implemented thus far will definitely not save an animal like the elephant who enjoys a lengthy lifespan. According to the Department of Wildlife Conservation (DWC), the number of tuskers in the wild remain as low as 55. This number will further drop if proper conservation methods arent implemented. 
Keeping this in mind, the Daily Mirror sheds light on the recent attack on the majestic Dala Poottuwa, state interventions and suggested conservation methods for elephants in Sri Lanka. 

Galgamuwa Dala Poottuwa 
Also known as the Heritage of Wayamba, the Galgamuwa tusker was a well-built elephant of over 12 feet in height and is said to have been over 50 years old. The tusker was blinded in one eye following a shooting incident that had taken place several years ago. This was just six months before its tragic killing. Before the killing, DWC officials were treating this majestic being in Siyambalangamuwa. He had the habit of frequenting Kala Wewa and the Siyambalangamuwa forest reserves. According to area residents in Siyambalangamuwa, this tusker was known to be an innocent creature when compared to other elephants who frequented the village and caused damage. 
The tusker started making headlines on November 23, 2017 when two tusks, with a unique curvature and similar to those of Dala Poottuwa, were found in Nikawewa, a remote village in the Moragollagama Grama Seva Division. Two suspects, a Grama Niladhari and a retired Police constable, who was in possession of these tusks and six ivory gemstones (Gaja Muthu), were arrested by the Walana Anti-Corruption Unit.

Following this find, a team comprising Special Task Force (STF) and five groups including DWC officials and Police commenced a search operation on November 27 to find the tusker, alive or dead. Following a tip-off, a plot of land in Thibbotuwawa too was excavated in several places in search of its remains. This land also belonged to one of the suspects in custody. Despite being futile, the search operations were continued. In the end the body was found in a forest reserve bordering SorowWewa on November 29. Upon discovering its body, officials were yet to confirm whether it was a killing. However, the body was in a rotten state as the elephants remains were two-three weeks old.

The post-mortem was conducted on November 30 by two veterinarians namely, Dr. Tharaka Prasad and Dr. Chandana Jayasinghe from Colombo and Anuradhapura respectively. According to A. H Sumanasena, Assistant Director of DWC in Siyambalangamuwa, the observations confirmed that the body belonged to this tusker. The post-mortem revealed that the elephant had been killed as a result of being fired at with a shotgun. Ten (10) bullets were found in its head. Investigations further confirmed that the elephant would have died due to brain damage. A wound in its left hind leg, which was under medication a few months ago, further confirmed the identity of Dala Poottuwa. 
That night itself, five more suspects were arrested by Polpithigama Police following a tip-off received by the CID in the Nikawaratiya and Ambanpola areas. Two tusk cutting saws, part of a hand saw, two pendants made of ivory, one ivory talisman, part of an elephant tusk and organic ivory gemstone (Gaja Muthu) were found when the suspects were taken in to custody.



Perpetrators will be severely dealt with
-Gamini Jayawickrama Perera 

Subject Minister Gamini Jayawickrama Perera said that although five suspects have been arrested, investigations have now been handed over to the Criminal Investigation Department (CID). The law is very weak and we have to change the entire act. There has to be strict penalties imposed in order to put these culprits behind bars. In order to ensure harmony between people and these elephants we have implemented many solutions, but people still consider them as threats. Earlier if a person died or got disabled or wounded in a Human Elephant Conflict (HEC) they were given only Rs.
200,000 but I raised this amount to Rs. 500,000. In terms of crop damage we also introduced insurance schemes for farmers. So under these circumstances I dont understand the reason behind these killings,said Perera.

The law is very weak and we have to change the entire act. There has to be strict penalties imposed in order to put these culprits behind bars

Speaking about the Galgamuwa tuskers incident the Minister said that when the DWC officials visited the suspects house they had been making jewelry items out of tusks. In such instances people should give tip-offs and keep our officials informed. Theres a shortage of manpower in the Department and its a challenge for the officers to be travelling everywhere as and when they receive news. Sometimes they work day and night to ensure the safety of animals. Another worry I have is regarding the reports that there have been many incidents where baby elephants have been tied up for weeks. Several months earlier we saw elephants swimming in the sea. Therefore there are many organized groups aiming at keeping elephants in captivity for various purposes and these matters need to be probed. But we wont tolerate crimes of this nature taking place and the perpetrators will be severely dealt with,said the minister.


Nobody can get away with killing an animal
-Jagath Gunawardena

Speaking to the Daily Mirror, senior environmental lawyer and wildlife enthusiast Jagath Gunawardena said that elephants are a protected species under the Flora and Fauna Protection Ordinance (FFPO). From Section 12 till 24, this fact is quite clear. Section 12 mentions that no one can injure or harm an elephant, while Section 22 (A) states that its an offence to retain a tusk or part of a tusk of an elephant except in accordance to a permit. Those who illegally retain tusks in their possession could be punished according to the Public Property Act (PPA).
The illegal capture of elephants has been continuing for years and this issue of elephants hasnt been a single one. There are many aspects that must be considered. First we have to build a public perception that nobody can get away with after killing an animal. But if the law doesnt stand firm, people wont hesitate to kill an animal or do any crime for that matter and get away with.

First we have to build a public perception that nobody can get away with after killing an animal

I have observed a lack of power, adequate facilities and low morality in people who handle these issues, said Gunawardena who is quite concerned about conserving these species. If the law could be that lenient to allow those in power to keep elephants in captivity in their houses for everybody to see, then killing a wild elephant is an act that anybody could get away with. Such impunity therefore is dangerous. In terms of trading, once again Section 24 states that nobody can retain parts of animals in their possession unless issued through permits. The DWC gets some information and sadly theres a delay in implementing the law and prosecuting the perpetrators, said Gunawardena.


Only 5% of Sri Lankan male elephants have tusks
- Dr.Prithiviraj Fernando 

Airing his views on this regard, elephant researcher and Chairman of Centre for Conservation and Research (CCR), Dr.Prithiviraj Fernando said that biologically there is no greater difference between tuskers and non-tuskers. In African elephants, both males and females have tusks. But in Asian elephants the males have tusks. The Sri Lankan elephant population has close to 5% of males that have tusks when compared to the elephant population in India where 95% of males have tusks. The reduction in our tusker population is mainly due to capturing them and taking them out of the wild. Culturally, people have a high regard for tusks and these practices have continued for years, he warned.
Voicing out his concerns on the aggravating HEC, Dr. Fernando further said that various activities are being carried out in terms of agriculture development. Unfortunately most of these activities done are confrontational. As a result elephants become quite aggressive due to these confrontational practices and the matter has escalated over the past few months. Non-confrontational methods such as electric fencing need to be encouraged, but they cant be done single-handedly. Its important that we implement the law. If we dont do that, we will be encouraging people to commit more crimes. We shouldnt be encouraging illegal practices such as killing elephants for tusks,affirmed Dr. Fernando. When inquired from U.L Thaufeeq, DWC Deputy Director for Elephant conservation, he said that those found guilty of killing an elephant or other animals protected under the FFPO, they will have to serve a two-year jail term and pay a fine of five lakhs. 
 Only 5% of Sri Lankan male elephants have tusks
No temple needs tusks, elephants or GajaMuthu for prestige says Ven. Ananda Sagara Thera
Keeping this in mind, the Daily Mirror spoke to the Convener of the National Environmental Guild, Ven. Pahiyangala Ananda Sagara Thera. Ven. Sagara Thera said that according to this new wave of Buddhism, it is a must to keep elephants and tusks in temples. During the time of the Buddha when He couldnt persuade the monks in Kosambi from quarrelling, He left Kosambi alone to Parileyyaka Forest. Here an elephant, who had given up communal life, attended to the needs of the Buddha. When Buddha left for Jethavanaya, this elephant and several other animals followed Him towards the boundary of that forest. Upon seeing his departure, the elephant died due to being broken heart. If Buddhism spoke about possessing elephants and tusks, this would have been an ideal occasion for the Buddha to preach the importance of keeping elephants and tusks in a temple. But He never preached on these lines. Elephants and other animals belong to the wild and they should die in their own habitats, the priest said.

But the regime change definitely hasnt helped this cause much. Surprisingly, the transaction of the tusks in this incident was also carried out at a temple in Nikawewa. Does this indirectly mean that temples are promoting the message of cruelty to elephants or any animal for that matter

Ven. Sagara Thera further said that by preaching bana with two tusks on either side just promotes one thing and that is cruelty to elephants. These practices will only encourage the inception of a cruel society. We say May All beings be free of cruelty and then do the opposite. If you go to a temple, you see an elephant in the backyard, two tusks in the living room or the entrance of the temple and GajaMuthu in its relic casket. Doesnt these show how cruel this religion has become I believe that a case should be filed immediately against everybody from that GramaNiladhari to the retired Police officer. All other suspects should be prosecuted. Several tusks have also been found from various places where other incidents took place. I believe that we should destroy them once again as was done some time back at Galle Face Green. No temple needs tusks, elephants or GajaMuthu for their prestige, Ven. Sagara Thera said.
Indication of an illegal ivory trade taking root in Sri Lanka says Manori Gunawardena 
Commenting on this issue, ManoriGunawardena, Country Representative of Born Free Foundation, said that the arrest of persons linked to an organized network of ivory traders and poachers should not be considered an isolated incident. Its an indication that an illegal ivory trade is taking root in Sri Lanka. The target killing of tuskers is worrying and it calls for increased vigilance and action among all law enforcement agencies,said Gunawardena.

A heated exchange between two leading politicos from the Rajarata which saw the angry duo screaming obscenities at each other had marred the proceedings of a meeting held at the headquarters of a political party the other day.

The fight had started when one of them claimed a right to have a greater say in regard to matters relating to the province than the other who called an outsider and it had ended short of fisticuffs thanks to the intervention of a very senior member of the party, they say.
There has been fierce rivalry between the two politicos for the partys leadership position in the province over the years and clashes between them now and then had been a regular feature, they say.

Fuel purchases- CPC incurs Rs.5,8 Mn loss on spot tenders: JVP
	
JVP MP Nalinda Jayatissa said today the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) had incurred a loss of Rs.5,838 million because of the purchase of fuel on spot tenders between August 23 and November 3 this year.
He said that the CPC had purchased 12 consignments of fuel on spot tenders because the Petroleum Resources Development Minister had failed to submit the Cabinet paper to purchase fuel on long term tenders.
"The decision of the stock review committee chaired by the subject minister, to purchase fuel on term tenders for 2017 and 2018, was approved by the technical evaluation committee. However, as the minister failed to submit the Cabinet paper on time to make the approved purchase, the CPC had to purchase 12 fuel stocks on spot tenders, resulting in a loss of US$ 38 million," he said.
Minister Arjuna Ranatunga said they wanted to change the system adopted by the previous government, which had offered the tender to a single person, whereas 83 bidders had been registered.
He said a committee was appointed to change the old methodology and added that a mechanism to purchase fuel on long term tenders would be established by March next year.
However, the MP said if the previous system was changed for the better, it should have been beneficial for the country, and said that instead, it had incurred a loss. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)

Hackers preying on businessmen via email: CERT|CC
	
During the last two months, the Computer Emergency Readiness Team | Co-ordination Centre (CERT|CC) has received four complaints over fraudsters attempting to hack email accounts of businessmen and luring them to make remittances.
CERT|CC Principal Information Security Engineer Roshan Chandragupta said many people had fallen prey to one of the latest techniques where peoples accounts were being hacked and they were requested to change their bank account details due to a change of supplier details.
Many victims of this scam have suffered huge losses. The fraudsters learn from stolen emails the transactions between the seller and consignor as well as the buyer and paying company. Masquerading as the company, these fraudsters later generate emails requesting their client to credit the amount payable to a new account, claiming that the email address and payment receiving bank account number have been changed. It is only when the buyer contacts the bank that he or she finds they have been deceived. Recipients of these fictitious emails should be cautious as they look genuine. They should be careful when exchanging confidential details via emails. If anyone receives such emails, it is advisable to contact the bank or seller to verify. Over the past eleven months, we have received at least 3,400 complaints over fake facebook accounts. Surprisingly, all of them were related to sharing images or passwords and creating similar accounts. During investigations, it was revealed that most of the account holders had myriads of friends on their accounts, most of whom were unknown to them, Mr. Chandragupta said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

The employees of a key government department working on the upper floors suffered much inconvenience recently when they were forced to climb up and down the stairs for four days as a result of the elevator of the building complex being put out of operation.
Inquiries made later revealed that the suspension of the operation of the lift by a strange turn of circumstances was linked to a top white collar female working on the ground floor taking with her the keys of her office room when going on leave for four days and to the still more strange happen-so that the access door to both her office and the elevator control room being one and the same!
All department top executives are expected to leave the keys to their offices with the security division when going on leave and this particular fair white collar one, an intimate of a powerful politico, does not observe this rule, employees say.

Lakmal vomits on field, Delhi may lose winter tests
	
Sri Lankanpaceman Suranga Lakmal has vomitted on the field before walking off as Delhi's 'notorious' smogmay rob the Indian capital of future winter tests,the Hindu reported today.
The smog is continuingto plague the third and final match on Tuesday, it said.
India's second innings was into its sixth over when Lakmal was seen bending over and throwing up. The Sri Lankan physio rushed in and eventually walked off with the player.
Lakmal, who returned to bowl the 11th over, and pace colleague Lahiru Gamage had also walked off on Sunday with discomforts.
The Indian cricket board (BCCI) said it would factor in Delhi's pollution before scheduling a match in the city at this time of the year.
This point about scheduling matches in Delhi in this particular period can be considered in view of the situation encountered in the last two-three days, acting BCCI secretary Amitabh Choudhary has told reporters late on Monday.
This pollution issue has been spoken about for years ... It can't be seen affecting just one walk of life. The agencies which need to be dealing with it, I'm sure are dealing with it.
Delhi's government last month ordered schools to shut temporarily after pollution readings in some places peaked at 500, the most severe level on the government's air quality index that measures poisonous particles.
The pollution prompted the board to cancel two Ranji Trophy matches in Delhi last year.
As you are aware, the BCCI is sensitive about this fog and smog over the years when they scheduled domestic games out of Delhi... Mr. Choudhary said.
Several Sri Lankan players had their facemasks on even on Tuesday.
Their coach Nic Pothas has called Delhi's air pollution a unique and well-documented problem but Mr. Choudhary said Sri Lanka Cricket did not raise the issue when the tour was being finalised.
If they had any [objection], they didn't express it to me, Mr. Choudhary said.

## Title: Malini Fonseka  From the girl to the woman

Malini Fonseka  From the girl to the woman
	

The line between emotional authenticity and contrived melodrama has been so thin that even our best actors cant resist crossing it. If its surprising to come across Ranjan Ramanayake in as atypical a performance as the youngest son in Awaragira, or the father to the Gautama Buddha in Siddhartha Gautama, its not because we dont doubt their ability in both the commercial and the serious cinema, but because he (and others like him) have not been given a proper outlet to be flexible in that sense. This is roughly true of every film industry which lacks a solid base: some actors make it and adapt, others remain more or less limited. In Rukmani Devi we come across the former of these. She remained, to her last, a veritable queen, but she retained a certain welter of conviction. After her we come across another monarch in Gamini Fonseka. It is only after Gamini Fonseka, then, that we come across our cinemas first real queen, Malini Fonseka.
In the two Fonsekas we see a bifurcation of the sensibilities that nurtured Rukmani Devi, between our need for a hero and our need for a heroine. Its certainly not true that Gamini and Malini represented a synthesis of aesthetic sensibilities when they were cast together (whether in a commercial outing like Hondata Hondai or a more serious outing like Nidhanaya) because Malini was the first actress here able to make herself the only destined woman to whatever man she was paired with. If one imagines her equally adept in front of not just Gamini, but also Tony Ranasinghe, Joe Abeywickrama, Vijaya Kumaratunga, and the later generation of Amarasiri Kalansuriya, Ravindra Randeniya and Lucky Dias, it is because, as Asoka Handagama pointed out in a social media status, her characters were conceived to enrapture the male protagonist. They existed almost solely for this reason.

She was earlier the girl next door; now she has become the woman next door, all too aware of the rift between fantasy and reality
Malini was the idealised female, the fetishized woman. Even in the worst film concocted here, she gave a decent performance, and in all her performances, she made every man who came across her desire her. Directors who realised this tapped into the box-office potential of their movies, not by pairing her with the two biggest names in the country (Gamini and Vijaya), but by separating her from the characters they played. In K. A. W. Pereras Wasana Vijayas character croons Jothipala: Oba Langa Inna was that films distillation of this quality in Malinis lovers. Separation they say makes the heart grow fonder. This was the underlying philosophy in Wasana and later, in H. D. Premaratnes Apeksha. Malini not only made us want her, she also made us go to any lengths to have her. Its difficult to think of any other actress here who could equal her in this respect, if at all because her directors were shrewd enough to understand where her forte lay.
That explains why she was never really a femme fatale. The closest to such a character that she got to was the unsullied heroine in Sasara Chethana, which she herself directed and which had her intertwine the Western with the fairy-tale-like theme of forced separation at childhood. But even there she was unsullied, whose sense of chastity was so calculated and yet fresh. Her most distinctive features  the sleek, flowing hair (which she uses in Sasara Chethana to fight a villain), the shy, contained, but genuine smile, and the beguiling, yet careful eyes  helped her in this regard. Some of her most memorable commercial outings in the seventies  the films of K. A. W. Perera, for instance  personifies her as a doll: fragile, defiant, tempestuous. In Sahanaya (directed by J. Selvarathnam) she was paired with Gamini, but their roles are somewhat inverted: she is the spoilt heiress; he is the idealist who paints her, and compels her to slap him angrily when she finds out. Sequences like that abound in many of her films, but they are always intermittent, and always there for a reason: to ensnare the man closer to her.
If theres an almost naive sense of self-discovery in her first roles its because thats who she is in real life. A biographical sketch would help us here. Malini Senehelatha Fonseka was born on April 30, 1947 in Peliyagoda as the third child of a family of 11 siblings. She was educated, firstly in Nugegoda, later at Gurukula Maha Vidyalaya in Kelaniya, where she met and befriended some of her later collaborators: Wimal Kumar da Costa (a classmate), H. D. Premaratne, and Donald Karunaratne. Gurukula bordered on the Vidyalankara Campus (now the University of Kelaniya), and got her involved in the theatre.
One day some students from Vidyalankara came over looking for an actress to play the lead role: a problem because the University had no women, only boys and monks. The dancing teacher at Gurukula considered Malini, asked her, and after she got permission from her family, acted in it. That play, Noratha Ratha, was written and directed by H. D. Werasiri, and marked the first time she had acted outside school.
In 1965 she took part in a play titled Akal Wessa, which won for her a Best Actress Award and got her the attention of two members in the audience who were looking for a newcomer to play the leading female character in an upcoming film. Tissa Liyanasuriya and Joe Abeywickrama unanimously chose her for her intense subtlety. Remembering his choice many decades later to me, he had this to say: Some people thought she was thin and rather unsuitable for my film, that she was untried. Joe was satisfied with her though, and so was I. Punchi Baba marked Malinis first foray into the cinema. Of her encounters aboard it Liyanasuriya had this to say: I didnt order her around. She seemed fully involved. That sense of being involved and committed was what coloured her career in the seventies, but in these first few performances (including her second role, as the distraught sister to an obsessed elder brother, played by Henry Jayasena, in Dahasak Sithuvili) she was still naive: more the girl next door than the girl of your heart.
You see Malini shedding this avatar from her through her first serious roles, particularly Akkara Paha, where she was the sister to another obsessed, introspective brother, played by Milton Jayawardena. In Dahasak Sithuvili she more or less succumbs to the quirks and fits of temper of Henry Jayasena, but here shes more assured, more assertive. By the time she was featured in Nidhanaya, which was the culmination of all those commercial outings that paired her with Gamini Fonseka, she was fully aware of her own parameters: she has let go of being the girl next door, in other words. This was true especially of Siripala saha Ranmenika, which had her opposite Ravindra Randeniya, as well as the films of Dharmasena Pathiraja: from a minor role (again, as a sister) in Ahas Gawwa to the titular role in Eya Dan Loku Lamayek, and to Bambaru Avith and Pathirajas understated masterpiece, Soldadu Unnahe. Soldadu Unnahe, however, lacks conviction on her part, because she was a prostitute, cast against type: consequently, despite her outbursts and tempestuousness, despite that ending where she is poignantly taken away, she is as convincing (if you can put it that way) as Swarna Mallawarachchi in Anjana.
Its a sign of her personal tastes perhaps, but when I ask her as to what her favourite film is, she first thinks for a while and replies, Aradhana. This film, directed by Vijaya Dharma Sri, has Ravindra Randeniya befriend her and then, pushed by guilt and infatuation, come back to reclaim her. His character here is almost like his character from Vasantha Obeyesekeres Dadayama, and in fact the entire film inverts Obeyesekeres (even though the latter was released three years after Aradhana) to compel a happy resolution. That it was screened in the eighties, and in colour, is not a coincidence, because Malini admits that those were her favourite years (the years which saw her rise from a player to a director: Sasara Chethana in 1984, Ahinsa in 1987, Sthree in 1991, Sandamala in 1994. All these thematise femininity: frail, open to abuse, but always well meaning and vindicated. Sthree is an attempt at universalising the female experience by drawing a parallel between her characters travails and those of a newly reared cow.
As the years went by, it seemed as though she took on increasingly matriarchal roles, as evidenced by her acclaimed performances in Punchi Suranganawi (2002), Wekanda Walauwwa (2003), and Ammawarune (2006). It would be unforgivable to omit her role in Prasanna Vithanages Akasa Kusum (2009) here, and I think it merits much more than a cursory glance. She won her quite a number of awards internationally, including the Silver Peacock at the Indian Film Festival (which she herself called the biggest achievement in my forty years in the cinema). The role was that of a former film star whose return to fame is marked by scandal. In hindsight, perhaps Prasanna Vithanage was spot-on for having chosen her to play the character. Echoing the fading film star motif which has figured in countless films in the West, the film delved into the patriarchal despotism at the heart of our country and our entertainment industry.

If theres an almost naive sense of self-discovery in her first roles its because thats who
she is in real life
One can spot out a kind of naked austerity in Malinis performance. There are no attempts at exaggerating: here, more than in any of her previous films, she achieves a deliberate underplaying on her part. This underplaying is essential for her character of Sandya Rani, whose nostalgic reveries of the past are underscored by a harsh, all-too real present. The clash of personal feeling and class/social realities (especially when she gets involved in the scandal the movie centres on) is the epicentre of the narrative, and she epitomises this clash succinctly. Suffice it to say that it represents the achieving of an overarching goal Malinis career has revolved around: the removal of the theatrical and the excessively emotional from her acting. She was earlier the girl next door; now she has become the woman next door, all too aware of the rift between fantasy and reality. Malini Fonsekas career has been, in that sense, an attempt at self-discovery. In this phase of her career, it seems as though that she has completed her course in that respect.

Met. Dept. says more rain likely
	
Showers or thundershowers will occur at times in the Northern, North-Central, Eastern and Uva Provinces and at several places elsewhere after 2.00 p.m today, because the low pressure area in the South-East Bay of Bengal is located some 800 km away from the country, the Meteorology Department said.
Met Department Director General K.H.M.S. Premalal said it was likely to develop into a depression by tomorrow but would not create a large impact on the land area.
Fairly heavy showers of about 75mm are being expected in the Eastern, Northern, North-central and Uva provinces while gusty winds up to 50 kmph are expected in the Northern, Eastern, Uva, Sabaragamuwa and Western Provinces and in Galle and Matara districts.
The Met. Department said there could be temporary localized strong winds during thundershowers and the people are requested to take adequate precautions to minimize damage caused by lightning.
Meanwhile, it said the sea areas 200 km off the North-Eastern, Eastern and South-Eastern coasts, and in Central Bay of Bengal could be very rough because the wind speeds were likely to increase up to 100 kmph.
Showers or thundershowers will occur at times in the sea areas off the coast extending from Potuvil to Kankesanturai via Trincomalee.
Winds will be north-easterly to northerly in direction in the sea area around the island with wind speeds of up to 40 kmph.
The shallow sea area off the coast extending from Potuvil to Kankesanturai via Trincomalee and Colombo to Matara via Galle and Hambantota could be temporarily rough, as the wind speed can increase up to 60-70 kmph.
Temporarily strong winds (up to 80 kmph) and the seas are likely to be rough during the thundershowers.
The warning issued to the naval and fishing communities were further extended.
The low pressure area which is to be turned into a depression, would later turn into a deep depression, and is believed to be entering India by Friday. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

No approval granted to use rice to produce alcohol: Finance Ministry
	
The Finance Ministry today claimed that there was no truth in the allegation made by Joint Opposition MP Bandula Gunawardena to the effect that this government has given approval to use rice as raw material for the production of alcohol.
While issuing a statement, the Ministry said it was in fact the approval to use rice for the production of alcohol was given by the previous government in 2006.
This government has not given any approval to produce spirits making use of rice as a raw material to any distilleries. There are 14 distilleries in Sri Lanka and they use palmyra toddy, coconut toddy, molasses, maize and fruits to produce spirits. In 2006, the previous government had granted the approval to a liquor manufacturing company to produce spirits using rice as raw material. But, recently, in addition to rice, the particular company was granted permission to use maize as a raw material, the statement said.
It further said, in the 2018 budget, it was proposed to levy excise duty on the raw materials used for the production of ethanol.
Accordingly, by the gazette extraordinary issued under the Excise Ordinance on November 9, 2017, a levy of Rs.5 to Rs.10 per litre has been imposed on the raw materials used for the production of spirits.

Sampath Bank empowers local merchants with UnionPay card acceptance
	
Sampath Bank announced that its local merchant partners will now be able to accept UnionPay credit and debit cards for Point of Sale (POS) payments.
This move is set to give a significant boost to the banks local merchant partners who would now be able to welcome UnionPay cardholders. UnionPay is now one of the largest payment card networks in the world. It will also bring in greater convenience to consumers, especially the growing number of Chinese tourists visiting the island.
UnionPay cardholders already enjoy a host of benefits and privileges from Sampath Bank including the ability to withdraw money from over 350 ATMs on the island. Now, they can pay for direct purchases using their UnionPay credit and debit cards. Cardholders can shop in peace as the EMV enabled UnionPay cards (i.e. cards with an EMV chip embedded in them) offer greater protection against counterfeit and other types of fraud.
This facility has initially been made available at over 300 leading merchants around the island across key tourism related businesses such as gems and jewellery, tea, spices, dining and lodging and duty free shopping. These merchants will be able to accept UnionPay credit and debit cards in Sri Lankan Rupees and different foreign currencies on their Sampath Bank card terminals. Sampath Bank is striving to expand this to its base of over 5,000 terminals.
Commenting on this, Sampath Bank PLC Consumer Banking Senior Deputy General Manager Tharaka Ranwala said: Given the steady growth in the number of tourists visiting the country from China, we were looking for ways in which we could help our merchant partners grow their business with them. Enabling UnionPay credit and debit card acceptance at Point of Sale (POS) for our merchant partners in partnership with UnionPay International is one of the steps we have taken to facilitate this. We look forward to seeing tourists and local merchants avail the benefits of this move.
UnionPay International Product Director Shuan Ghaidan said: With UnionPay as the leading payment method among Chinese tourists, the demand for local payment and cash withdrawal with our cards continues to increase. Earlier on, we already joined hands to enable POS business in Sri Lanka; today the further deepened partnership with Sampath Bank on POS acceptance will definitely lead to a win-win situation. We will continue to strive to provide our card users seamless payment services around the globe and as the next step, we look forward to further exploring other payment opportunities with Sampath Bank in Sri Lanka.

The sea species which were found trapped in fishing nets at Nawaladi in Batticaloa had been handed over to the Eastern University for further investigations.
Hundreds of sea-snake like species were caught by the fishermen in the area on Sunday.
However, a University source said the species was more akin to a fish species rather than a snake species.
The fishermen who caught the species said they were facing difficulties when continuing with their livelihood because of the rough seas and the incident involving sea snakes.
According to reports,a large number of sea snakes had been caught in the wake of the 2004 tsunami as well.
Some residents said the sea snakes were really a species of eels and that the adverse weather conditions might have triggered their exodus towards the fishing nets.(T.l. Jawfer Khan)

There was no need of the former President Mahinda Rajapaksa to make the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) to win at the upcoming Local Government (LG) elections, Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe said.
While addressing a media briefing today at the SLFP Head Quarters he said the Joint Opposition had no right even to say that they would not support SLFP at the elections.
We will definitely win the upcoming LG elections even without the former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. More people are gathering with the President Maithripala Sirisena than ever before, the Minister said.
It is illegal for the JO to support any other party than the SLFP, he said.If they go and work for the victory of another party, that would be against the party Constitution. Therefore, we have to act against them. The door is still open. They can join President Maithripala Sirisena whenever they want and work to strengthen the SLFP, he said.
How can the JO members request the people in election campaigns to cast their vote to the Sri Lanka Podu Jana Peramuna (SLPP) while sitting in Parliament SLPP is a political party which is created to destroy the SLFP, Minister Samarasinghe said.
We are also using new technologies and we have records and photographs. We will had it documented wherever or whenever any of the JO member ask voters to support the SLPP, he said.
Not even at public rallies we will send people even to rural election campaigns of the JO.
They act like that. If they are attempting to destroy and act against the party it is clearly against the constitution. Therefore they cannot be in the SLFP and they cannot remain in Parliament or Provincial Councils, he said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

Sooriya Village  where everyone will soon know your name
	
It is a place that makes you feel it belongs to you and you belongto it
	Sometimes you want to go where everybody knows your name
	It is a place painters might feel was made for them; and them alone
	Sooriya Village opens at 10.30 am but the gates are openat 7.00 am
There is a song from the US sitcom Cheers that has been playing in my mind for sometime. For no reason that I can identify, I should add. This is how it goes: Sometimes you want to go where everybody knows your name, and they are always glad you came; you wanna be where you can see, our troubles are all the same; you wanna be where everybody knows your name.
Its about recognition, yes. Recognition comes with frequency, naturally. If you keep going to the same place for a long time and regularly too, then you end up getting to know others who are as regular and they get to know you in return. It is also about belonging, and thats a little bit different.

Sooriya Village works for me. It opens at 10.30 am but the gates are open at 7.00 am. All I have to do is walk in, find a place to sit and read or write. Or just be

We revisit places we like, people whose company we enjoy - almost like favourite movies or books. Each time we watch or read we discover and rediscover, we relive old delights and rejoice in new ones. We identify ourselves with characters or moments or even particular lines or thoughts. They grow on you. 


Sooriya Village has grown on me 
A freelance writer, one might assume, can write from anywhere and just email the story, true. Some like to work in silence and some like it when there is some non-intrusive stuff happening. Conversation fragments, the occasional laugh or sharp exclamation, a bit of music and even chit-chats with random people can constitute a real-world-in-a-nutshell that makes for a nice surround to the creative exercise. Well, for me at least. 
Sooriya Village works for me. It opens at 10.30 am but the gates are open at 7.00 am. All I have to do is walk in, find a place to sit and read or write. Or just be. There is enough green and enough nature-sounds to colour the place with music until those who are tasked to play the real music come in and do their thing. 
There are open and closed places and depending on the mood I can choose either, the latter after about 9.30 am. Sometimes the quietness of the library beckons, but most times I like to sit outside. A pot of tea or roti with butter and pol-sambol is what I would order, but most times I just sit and work. The people who work there ask me what I want and if I say just a glass of water they will just give it and do not give any hard looks at me. Just smiles and a few words and even this only if I was in the mood for chit-chat. They dont bother me and I try not to trouble them too much. 

There are open and closed places and depending on the mood I can choose either, the latter after about 9.30 am


Sanchitha Wickramasooriya, the young man who runs the place, never fails to check on me from time to time to ask me if there is anything I need. Most times he would give me a thumbs-up sign and an inquiring look and I would reciprocate with a smile and a nod of head that indicated I was fine. And he does that with everyone. 
Sometimes his father Udena, who is more politically-inclined, would stop by for a chat. There is a lot we can and do talk about. One day it would be politics. One day, environmental issues and tree planting projects. On another occasion we would talk about the arts, especially music. Most days, however, he would, like his son, acknowledge presence and go about his business, as I go about mine.
If someone wants to meet me, I say Come to Sooriya Village at such and such a time. Some know the place, some have heard of it and some have to be given directions. I have seen people I know coming here for a meal or just to meet someone. 
It draws a certain kind of individual. And keeps him or her. The ambience helps. There is green, there is openness, there is music. Slow-paced. Relaxing. There is an art presence that is signatured here. Part of it is architectural, with recording and practice studios and a mini-stage that is used for performances of all kinds, music as well as literary events. It is a place that painters might very well feel was made for them and them alone. The same would go for poets and other writers. Sooriya Village, after all, organizes all kinds of events that are of interest to different kinds of artists and art lovers and even if theres no event on the cards you can still walk in and be convinced that this place is for you and people like you. 
It is a place that makes you feel belonged. Both ways. It belongs to you and you belong to it. Everyone will get to know your name by and by and then remember it too. A place where sunlight bends into music and poetry, scrambles into flavour and fragrance, transforms itself into conversation fragments that can be pieced together as a story or a sculptural masterpiece or maybe congeals into a thought or insight that had been refusing to concretize for some time. 
It is my office. For now. A place where everyone knows my name.

Toilet served to answer a different call
	
A story about a provincial politico who was forced to remain inside a toilet for a long time in unforeseen circumstances is reportedly raising titters in political circles these days.
A virulent opponent of yahapalanaya, this provincial politico had on the sly called at the official residence of a senior purohita and was engaged in a lengthy discussion with him when a journalist with a photographer in tow suddenly arrived there.
The provincial politico who got panicky on seeing the duo from the Press, had exclaimed: Oh! My God! I am finished if they catch me talking to you! Looking about for a place to hide, he had seen a door open a few yards away at the corner of the building, rushed there and closed it behind him.
Once closing the door only, the man had realized that he had mistaken a servants toilet for a room.
It had taken more than one hour for the newsman to conclude his interview with the senior purohita and the provincial politico had emerged from the toilet only after the departure of the two visitors from the Press.

US, SL amend Open Skies Agreement
	
Sri Lanka and the US signed an agreement to amend the US-Sri Lanka Open Skies Agreement of 2002 to facilitate the movement of cargo goods more efficiently and profitably, the US Embassy said today.
In a statement, it said US Ambassador to Sri Lanka Atul Keshap and Transport and Civil Aviation Ministry Secretary G. S. Withanage signed the agreement on Monday.
The Embassy said the amendment strengthens global express delivery cargo networks, enhances bilateral connectivity and competitiveness, and facilitates economic growth and job creation. 
Ambassador Keshap said the amendment to the bilateral Open Skies Agreement further strengthens the robust and longstanding trade relationship between the US and Sri Lanka.
As Sri Lankas largest trading partner, the US seeks economic growth that provides employment and opportunity for the citizens of both our nations, he said.
The signing took place during the Tenth International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Air Services Negotiation Event (ICAN 2017) held in Colombo on Monday.
Within the ICAN 2017 framework, the US is meeting with over a dozen countries and agreed in principle on amendments to two existing aviation agreements to expand rights for US carriers to include key seventh-freedom rights for all-cargo operations, the Embassy said.
This years ICAN also provides a venue to discuss a wide range of civil aviation issues with bilateral partner governments to resolve business issues and to obtain new rights for US carriers. The US delegation includes representatives from the Departments of State and Transportation, it said.

Yemens Houthis announce former president Saleh killed
	

DPA, 04th DECEMBER, 2017-
Yemens former president Ali Abdullah Saleh has been killed, the rebel Houthi-affiliated Interior Ministry said on Monday, less than a week after disputes erupted between the former allies.
Saleh ruled Yemen for more than three decades, carrying out several wars against the Houthis before he was forced to step down in 2012. He then formed a surprising alliance with the Iran-backed rebel group after their takeover of the capital Sanaa in late 2014.
The ministry of interior announces the end of the treason militias crisis and the killing of its leader and a number of its elements, according to a ministry statement published by Houthi-affiliated media.
Unverified graphic images and videos were circulating on social media allegedly showing Salehs body.
Earlier in the day, the Shiite rebels blew up Salehs house in the capital Sanaa shortly after storming it.
The Houthis also claimed they took control of several areas where forces loyal to Saleh were stationed, adding that hundreds of them surrendered.
Clashes between the two sides began on Wednesday when Houthi insurgents stormed a key Sanaa mosque controlled by pro-Saleh forces. Both sides have traded blame over the violence.

Zimbabwe president swears in cabinet with changes to pacify public
	

DPA, 04th DECEMBER, 2017
Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa on Monday swore in his cabinet, with several last-minute changes after a public outcry about largely assigning posts to military leaders.
The following adjustments have been made to ensure compliance with the constitution and considerations of gender, demography and special needs, said secretary to the president, Misheck Sibanda, during the ceremony in the capital, Harare.
However, several key portfolios firmly remain in the hands of senior military officials and war veterans who were instrumental in the peaceful coup that brought the 75-year-old president to power in November.
No members of the opposition parties are included in the cabinet, something many Zimbabweans had hoped for after Mnangagwa took over from long-time leader Robert Mugabe.
