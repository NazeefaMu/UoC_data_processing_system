US, (Daily Mail), 21 September 2017-  America’s Got Talent crowned its season 12 champion Wednesday during a two-hour star-studded finale.   


Young ventriloquist singer Darci Lynne, 12, was named the winner of the $1 million prize and will go on to headline a Las Vegas show as the result of her win, which came after an impressive performance that saw her singing The Beatles’ hit With A Little Help From My Friends, with two different dummies.   


The talented young teen’s sensational win will come as no surprise, as Darci had been tipped as a front-runner since her first appearance on the talent contest.   


Deaf singer Mandy Harvey, dog act Sara & Hero, light-up dance crew Light Balance, and 10-year-old singer Angelica Hale all finished in the top five alongside blonde tween Darci - who was overjoyed at winning the competition.
