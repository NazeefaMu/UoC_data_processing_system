The Meteorology Department today said thunderstorms accompanied by severe lightning could occur during the next few hours in the North-Western, North-Central and Central Provinces and Mannar, Vavuniya and Kegalle Districts.

The Natural Hazards Early Warning Centre said fairly heavy showers above 100mm are expected at some places while temporarily strong gusty winds up to 70-80 kmph are also possible during thunder-showers.

The Department advised people to seek shelter, preferably indoors and never under trees. It also advised people to avoid open areas such as paddy fields, tea plantations and open water bodies during thunderstorms.

“People should avoid using wired telephones and connected electric appliances and using open vehicles, such as bicycles, tractors and boats during thunder-showers,” it said. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
