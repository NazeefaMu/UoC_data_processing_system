Mobitel is partnering with Ceylon Motor Sports Club to sponsor the eagerly anticipated Mahagastotte Hill Climb Race at Mahagastotte Hill, which has become a regular feature in the motor sports calendar in Sri Lanka. By supporting this legendary race, which dates back to 1934, Mobitel is forging strong ties with the realm of motor sports. The National Mobile Service Provider has been maintaining a high profile by partnering various sporting events which reflects its brand values of caring. Motor sports especially, mirror the high speed Mobitel broadband enjoyed by customers across the country. Mobitel is focused on supporting legendary sporting events which are highly anticipated by loyal fans. By lending its name to the event, Mobitel is able to highlight these sports that have become a part of the sporting fabric of the country. The races will be held on the 7th and 8th April in Mahagastotte, Nuwara Eliya.

The Ceylon Motor Sports Club, the oldest in Sri Lanka was inaugurated on September 4, 1934, at the Grand Hotel, Nuwara Eliya and celebrates 84 years this year. Their first meet was a Hill Climb at the Mahagastotte Estate in Nuwara Eliya on 28 September 1934, and is now a regular feature in the Motor Sports calendar. The Mahagastotte Hill Climb has a long history and perhaps could be termed as the birth place of organized motor racing in Sri Lanka or Ceylon as it was known then.
