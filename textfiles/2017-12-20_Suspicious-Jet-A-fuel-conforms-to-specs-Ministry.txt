Suspicious ‘Jet A1’ fuel conforms to specs: Ministry


	

The Indian Oil Company’s imported stock of suspicious “Jet A1” Aviation fuel which failed the first quality check has met standards set by the CPC during the second fuel sample testing, the Petroleum Resources Development Ministry said today.

The Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) conducted the second quality test with the participation of independent observers on Sunday (17) where they confirmed the samples were in line with CPC specifications.

Issuing a statement, the ministry said the rust in the oil tanker might have contaminated the fuel which could have ensured the stock did not meet specification during the first test.  
The Ministry said that during the second test, rust might have sunk down to the bottom of the ship as it docked at the Colombo Port, which ensured the fuel samples were cleared and confirmed to be of high quality.

The ministry said it has started to unload the stock this morning. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
