The Jaffna University announced the indefinite closure of three faculties with effect from today (31) because students boycotted lectures demanding the release of Tamil ‘political’ prisoners, the Vice Chancellor Prof. R. Vigneswaran said.

While issuing a statement today, the VC said the university administration had decided to close the Arts, Science and Management Studies and Commerce faculties with immediate effect until further notice.

According to the statement, the students in all hostels had been ordered to vacate their rooms and leave the campus premises before 4.00 p.m tomorrow (1).

VC Vigneswaran said due to indefinite closure of the university, the examinations which was scheduled to be held, have been postponed indefinitely.

However the students union said that they would continue their protest until a favourable response was given regarding the release of the Tamil ‘political’ prisoners. (Romesh Danushka Silva)
