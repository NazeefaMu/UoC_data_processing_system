UK police hunt Manchester bomber’s network


	



 

Police scrambled to close down a network around the Manchester suicide bomber with arrests in Britain and Tripoli on Wednesday, as details about the investigation were leaked to U.S. media, infuriating authorities who fear a second attack is imminent.  


British-born Salman Abedi, 22, who was known to security services, killed 22 people at a concert venue packed with children on Monday.  


Authorities believe he had help in building the bomb, which photographs published by the New York Times showed was sophisticated and powerful, and that his accomplices could be ready to strike again.
