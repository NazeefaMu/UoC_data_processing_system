The joint opposition today accused the government of attempting sell a large block of land belonging to Sathosa at D.R. Wijewardene Mawatha in Colombo 10 to an Indian Company belonging to a Tamil Nadu politician.

It said the previous government and trade ministers had continued to expand Sathosa assets but this government was keen to sell State properties.

“Most of the Indian companies are famous for ill-planned projects. An Indian company which was to initiate a project in Pulmudai has mentioned in its project report that water from an Indian river can be used for the project,” MP Bandula Gunawardena told a news briefing.

He said another valuable block of land belonging to the Trade Ministry and situated opposite the HSBC Global Service Centre in Rajagiriya has also been identified for sale to an Indian Company.

The MP said proposals were to be submitted to the Cabinet.

Meanwhile, he said the government’s move to handover historical buildings in Nuwara-Eliya, Kandy and Galle to an Indian Company for hotel projects would impact on World Heritage sites in Sri Lanka. (By Lahiru Pothmulla)
