More No-Confidence Motions should be brought in as such motions would expose those who robbed public funds in millions, State Minister Ranjan Ramanayake told Parliament today.

“The No-Confidence Motion on Prime Minister will and should not be the last, but more should come in as they will expose all robbers,” he said. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwadana)
