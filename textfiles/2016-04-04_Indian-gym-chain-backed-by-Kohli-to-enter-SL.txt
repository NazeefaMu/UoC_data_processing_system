Chisel has also tied up with a California-based firm. Satya Sinha, co-founder, Chisel Fitness, has told the DNA that their fitness centres are currently set up in Bengaluru and Andhra Pradesh.

"We will be opening centres at Delhi, Mumbai, Guwahati, Hyderabad, Indore and Chennai over the next few months and planning to set up 100 branches across India by 2018,” Sinha stated adding that they also plan to sell diet food and clothing.

A report in The New Indian Express stated that each centre will see an expenditure of nearly 20 million Indian rupees for set up.
