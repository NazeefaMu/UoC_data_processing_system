Unlimited funds for treatment of cancer patients


	

Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Minister Rajitha Senaratne has directed the Ministry to remove the threshold of Rs 1.5 million allocated for a cancer patient and to allocate funds without a limit for their treatments.

Minister said allocating a limited amount for treatment gives the notion that the patient should prepare for their death when the amount was drained.
