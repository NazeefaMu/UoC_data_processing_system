Minister Mangala Samaraweera made this comment at a media briefing held yesterday at the UNP head quarters Sirikotha in Pitakotte, replying to a question posed by a journalist. With the Pricing Formula on the Fuel pricing is in operation, it cannot be expected that there would be a price reduction today.
