Why he accepted the portfolio…


	


The new Transport Chief met his predecessor under the yahapalanya administration at the inaugural sittings of the Diyawanna council. They are long standing political rivals from Uva.
Their dialogue at this encounter runs thus: New Transport Chief:  The main reason why I accepted this portfolio is to set right the wrongs done to our party supporters during your time.
Ex- Transport Chief: What are the wrongs done to your supporters during my time? New Transport Chief: Well, various wrongs have been done to them! If I cannot do justice to my supporters, I will quit this job! Ex- Transport Chief: (Laughs loud) we didn’t do any injustice to your people. We didn’t appoint wrong people to high positions!  Bus cleaners were promoted as Regional Managers during your time. We only set right such wrongs! New Transport Chief: You wait and see! The dialogue ends here and the two rivals now colleagues in the same Cabinet go their separate ways.
