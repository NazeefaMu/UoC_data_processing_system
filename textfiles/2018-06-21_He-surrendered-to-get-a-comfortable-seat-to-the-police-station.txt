A Police squad car was sent to raid a gambling den that was being operated in a village in the Western Province.

After being informed that the police were outside those inside the gambling den began to run helter skelter trying to escape the long arm of the law. All but one were trying to escape. One man however did not try to escape but ran as fast as he could to the police jeep that was parked outside and after opening the rear door he got in and took a seat on the rear seat of the vehicle. The only policeman in the vehicle at the time was the driver. The policeman looked back at the man who had taken a seat at the rear of the jeep and said to him, "All your friends are trying to escape from us so why did you give yourself up? Is it because you are honest?

“Sir, the police station is far away from here. Last time when the police came to raid the place they took all of us to the police station in a jeep that was so crowded I was forced to stand all the way to the police station. So this time I thought of making it a little more comfortable for me to travel when we are arrested and taken away. The police driver could not contain his mirth.(Upendra Priyankara Jathungama)
