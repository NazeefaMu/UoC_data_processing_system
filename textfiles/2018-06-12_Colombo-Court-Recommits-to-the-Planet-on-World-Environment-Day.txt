Colombo Court Hotel & Spa, Asia’s first CarbonNeutral® hotel, renewed its commitment on the fight against Climate Change for a fifth consecutive year on World Environment Day – a UN global initiative to raise awareness and instill action for the protection of the environment. 

A trailblazer in eco-design and sustainability in South Asia, Colombo Court was designed from inception with sustainability at the forefront using recycled and up-cycled material, from the tile floors to a spectacular bike handle sculpture that decorates the entrance of this eco-friendly hotel. Year after year, Colombo Court has implemented emissions-mitigating strategies to lower its impact on the environment, including switching to solar power and using glass bottles to eliminate the plastic use within the Hotel. 

Colombo Court announced their green certification renewal on World Environment Day to align their goals with the internationally designated day’s 2018 theme of ‘Beating Plastic Pollution’, reminding everyone the importance of eliminating single-use plastics and proper recycling procedures. 

Commenting on their latest achievement, Arun Thapar, Managing Director of Colombo Court Hotel & Spa, said, “If you walk down to the coastline or to our rivers, you can see the damage that is being done by the plastic used and dumped into our canals and oceans. This World Environment Day, our team and I are proud of the strides we have taken to reduce our plastic waste and to improve the quality of stay for our guests. We are extremely happy of our continuing long-term partnership with the Carbon Consulting Company, and hope to develop new strategies together that will further reduce our impact on the planet. The message we would like to convey to everyone this year is: If you can’t reuse it, refuse it.”

“According to EFL, only 40% of the plastic collected is recycled, whilst over 150,000 tonnes of plastic raw material for production is still being imported into the country”, quotes Sanith de Silva Wijeyeratne, CEO of The Carbon Consulting Company. “It is inspiring to see clients like Colombo Court take a stand on big issues like plastic waste and empower others in the hospitality industry to do the same. We congratulate them on their achievements and hope to see more in the hospitality and tourism industries follow their lead on helping protect our environment.”

“We want to represent new ideas and concepts, and bring positive energy to Colombo”, says Wojciech Raus, Hotel General Manager. “We endeavour to provide great hospitality to our guests and ensure to look after all our resources in the best possible way.”

Colombo Court Hotel & Spa is a unique Boutique Business Hotel with 32 rooms including suites in the heart of Colombo. In addition to its CarbonNeutral® Certification, TripAdvisor, a well-known travel platform, has rewarded the Hotel recently by inducting it to their ‘Certificate of Excellence Hall of Fame’. It is a recognition bestowed to Hotels that have earned TripAdvisor’s ‘Certificate of Excellence’ award for five consecutive years, and is based on guest comments and ratings.
