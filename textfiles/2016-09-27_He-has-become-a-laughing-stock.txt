He has become a laughing stock


	

The head of a certain government institution has become both a nuisance and a laughing stock to his subordinates, they say.



Subordinates complain that lecturing to them for several hours at a stretch at so-called official conferences frequently convened by him to brag about his own achievements has become more of a nuisance than a source of amusement, they say.

This institutional head makes it a point to have a few hand-picked cronies from among the high-ups seated by his side at these conferences to nod and grin approval at his utterances, they say. Whenever the institutional officials receive summons from the boss to attend these lengthy conferences they would utter in disgust: “Ah, Ah, another lunatic conference!”
