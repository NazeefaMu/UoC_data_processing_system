A group of activists called ‘Liberation Movement’ today staged a protest outside the Welikada Prison in Colombo demanding authorities to treat detainees humanely.
They urged that the detainees should be released if they were not treated humanely. They also said hundreds of female detainees only had access to one toilet and they had been given only one sanitary pad per month. Pix by Waruna Wanniarachchi
