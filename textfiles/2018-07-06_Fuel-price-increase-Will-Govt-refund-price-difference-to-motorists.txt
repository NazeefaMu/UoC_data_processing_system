JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake today asked in Parliament whether the government would refund those who purchased fuel at the increased prices from midnight on Thursday, prior to the price increase being stopped by President Maithripala Sirisena.

He said people had bought fuel at the increased price from midnight on Thursday and questioned whether Cabinet approval had been obtained to increase fuel prices and how the President was able to revoke this decision.

Speaker Karu Jayasuriya asked the Chief Government Whip Gayantha Karunathilake to refer this matter to the subject minister who was not in the House at the time. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)
