Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said today he had ordered a full investigation into the incident which occurred at the Homagama Courts where a certain group had held a protest against the remanding of Ven. Galagodaatte Gnanasara Thera.
He said he would submit a report to the most Venerable Mahanayaka Theras.
The Prime Minister told Parliament that the law would be enforced on anyone no matter who they were.
“Everyone is equal before the law and we will not allow ‘Somaramas’ and ‘Buddarakithas’ to emerge again," he said.
He who referred to the global situation said the practice today in the world is cooperation among all countries. Therefore he said Sri Lanka should also work with all the countries of the world. He said ten thousand acres in Andhra Pradesh has been given to China.
The Prime Minister said Sri Lanka should follow countries such as Singapore which had a considerable say in global affairs.
“Sri Lanka too is becoming an important country in the World and that's why the Foreign Ministry played a role in bringing about stability in the Maldives," he said adding that the recent overseas visits of President Maithripala Sirisena were ample proof of this situation. (Yohan Perera)
