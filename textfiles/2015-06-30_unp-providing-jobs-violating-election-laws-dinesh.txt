Mahajana Eksath Peramuna (MEP) Leader Dinesh Gunawardena today alleged that the UNP was providing jobs through all the ministries, thus violating the election laws and disregarding the agreements to uphold the election laws.
Mr. Gunawardena told media outside the election secretariat after making a complaint to the Elections Chief Mahinda Deshapriya that jobs were given without even considering the employee abilities and  observing due procedure.
He said the heads of all the departments had had to face much pressure because of this and added that they requested the Elections Chief to look into the matter immediately.
Mr. Gunawardane said he had agreed to look into the complaints against several ministries.
UPFA MP Dullas Alahapperuma said they were in possession of documents to prove the fact that moves were afoot to provide jobs in violation of elections laws.
“We have received documents showing that 1,200 applicants have been called for interviews on July 8th and 9th (600 on each day) and another 400 have been called for interviews on July 3 and 4 in certain ministries. Another 350 jobs were provided yesterday,” he said. (Ajith Siriwardana)
