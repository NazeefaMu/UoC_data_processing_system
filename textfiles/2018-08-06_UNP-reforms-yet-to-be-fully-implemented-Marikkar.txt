UNP reforms yet to be fully implemented: Marikkar


	

Recommendations made by the committee appointed by the United National Party (UNP) to recommend party reforms are yet to be implemented fully, MP S.M. Marikkar said today.

“I was also a member of that committee and we came up with several recommendations, which are still to be fully implemented,” he told a media briefing.

The MP faulted some of those appointed as directors in the state institutions saying this government was brought to power by the grassroots level UNP supporters who worked tirelessly for change.

“This government was not brought to power by those who wear coat and tie. I am one of those who helped the UNP win the Kollonnawa constituency in the presidential and general elections amid the threats of drug dealers. Those clad in suits did not participate in the campaign,” he said.

The MP said the government was suffering setbacks because it failed to make correct decisions at the right time. (Yohan Perera)
