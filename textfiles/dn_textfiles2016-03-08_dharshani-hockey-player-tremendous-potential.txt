Dharshani - a hockey player with tremendous potential

 
Twenty five year old Dharshani Herath from the quiet village of Kudugala off Ambatenna along the Kandy - Matale highway is a hockey player with tremendous potential who made it to the Sri Lanka women's hockey team through perseverance, dedication and hard work.
Speaking to this writer Dharshani Herath said that there is hardly any sport in her village except a little softball cricket in the paddy fields after harvest and also the villagers play a little volleyball. Amazingly she was quite fluent in English - a language she had picked in school and later developed it on her own. She has the talent to give impromptu speeches in English to suit the occasion. She is the classic example of Ned Miller's immortal hit "Do what you do, do well boy" Her command of the Queen's language is good - a language she could hardly use in her village or at home. But she has mastered it on her own.
She has represented the country as a right half in many international matches and now plays for the champion Sri Lanka navy team.
She said that she attended Seetha Devi Balika Vidyalaya in Kandy and often had to travel in three buses to reach her school. From Kudugala she had to walk a few kilometres to Ambatenna if the bus from village to Kandy is not available or she had missed it due to it being full to capacity. From Kandy to her school at Mulgampola she had to take another bus. All this is time consuming and often she had to leave home before the first streaks of sunlight fall. The same hassle is there when returning home after hockey practices. Fortunately her good friend Geethani Abeyratne was with her and they struck up a bond of friendship which is growing strong every day.
She said one day while playing in the school compound during the short interval her hockey coach M A M Ashroff spotted her and wanted to know whether she would like to play hockey. Since this opportunity had been offered to her, she grabbed it with both hands. "I was just around ten years and being a girl brought up in a village environment or sylvan surroundings I had to get the approval of my parents which I did as I was able to convince them".
She played for the schools under 13 team for three years and captained it for one year in which they did well winning the Kandy District championship title and also performed well at the all island championship. Next she represented her school in the under 15 and under 17 tournaments and for two years the under 19 team. She played for the under 19 team for two years.
She said that getting a place in the Seetha Devi Balika vidyalaya's hockey team was a tough task as it was oozing with talent and when they were winning trophies after trophies it was difficult to displace the regulars as they had established themselves. But still she played for the Central Province schools in 2011 she represented the Sri Lanka Schools at the Junior Asiad held in Thailand. Her play came in for much praise. Her next international representation was Women's Asiad held in Singapore. She represented Seetha Devi Sports Club at the Singapore Sixes held in Kuala Lumpur in 2009 and they finished runner up and two years later they won the championship.
She has also represented the Kandy District at women's nationals and has been a regular member of Seetha Devi Sports Club which fielded a full complement of national players.
Since 2009 she has been representing the Sri Lanka Navy and the Defence Services. In fact last year she was in the Navy women's team which won the womens nationals for the first time. She has also represented the country at the Asian Challengers Trophy and the World League championships in the recent years. She paid a glowing tribute to her hockey coach M A M Ashroff who identified her talent chiselled her skills and made her play in the right berth as right half where goal scoring opportunities are few. But she said the halves make the ground work for the flankers and the forwards to do the scoring. They have an important role to play in both attack and defence. She hopes to continue her hockey for many more years. Her employers Sri Lanka Navy give her all the encouragement and guidance and here too her coach is Ashroff.
