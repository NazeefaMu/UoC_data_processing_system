More SL women go for beer: President


	

President Maithripala Sirisena today lamented the fact that an increasing number of Sri Lankan women were taking to drinking beer even though it was heartening to see a decline in the smoking habit.

He said the control and prevention of alcoholism and drug abuse was a collective responsibility of all concerned.

The President said every effort should be made to prevent schoolchildren falling victim to narcotics and alcohol because if not it will end up as a national disaster.

He sounded this cautionary note at a ceremony held at the BMICH today to distribute ‘Life time Achievement National Awards’ of the ‘Mithuru Mithuro’, a non profit local NGO dedicated to rehabilitate and socially integrate young drug addicts.

“We must ask ourselves whether we have fulfilled our responsibilities to the satisfaction of the family, society and the country? If we have done that then drug abuse cannot be a problem. But we all are aware that drug abuse has become a pressing national issue worldwide,” the President said. "It is extremely vital for politicians, officials, the business community, clergy, teachers and parents to perform their duty and the nation and only then that we can save the nation and wean away the younger generation in particular from drugs, alcohol and smoking."
