Tourism Authority to probe Mirissa resorts


	

An investigation had been launched by the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA) on the reports that some resorts located in the Mirissa Bay had refused to serve food or provide accommodation to locals because of their 'unruly behaviour'.
Responding to a Daily Mirror article SLTDA said it would immediately investigate into the matter and initiate appropriate action according to the direction of the Minister of Tourism Development.
Following a preliminary investigation, the Authority had found that some of the restaurants in the area were not registered under the SLTDA.
“Both the Ministry and SLTDA recognise the principle of equality and nondiscrimination in all aspects including the business of tourism and to work towards the continued growth of the tourism industry in a secure and sustainable manner in order to benefit the national economy,” the statement said.
