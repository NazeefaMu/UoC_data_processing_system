The former economic development minister Basil Rajapaksa today filed a fundamental rights petition stating that the Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID) is planning to arrest him and have him remanded without bail alleging that he had amassed wealth illegally.


He said an investigation of the B-reports and further reports filed in the Magistrate’s Courts by the FCID reveal that the author/authors of the reports, contrary to the provisions of Article 13(5) of the Constitution have already pre-judged him to be guilty of illegallyamassing wealth.


Aricle 13(5) reads, “Every person shall be presumed innocent until he is proved guilty: Provided that the burden of proving particular facts may, by law, be placed on an accused person”


The IGP, DIG Ravi Waidyalankara, ASP Serasinghe, Chief Inspector R.A.C.P.Ranasinghe, Inspectors SajithRatnayake and Annesley all of the FCID, Anti-Corruption Committee Director AnandaWijepala, MudithaJayakody,UpulDissanayake and the Attorney General were cited as respondents (S.S.Selvanayagam)
