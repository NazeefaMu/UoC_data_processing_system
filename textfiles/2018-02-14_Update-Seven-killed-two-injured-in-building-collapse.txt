At least seven people had been killed and two injured when a single-storey building used to store spices collapsed at Babapulle Place, Grandpass this evening, the Police said.

The Police said three men and four women were among the deceased.

“The injured were admitted to the Colombo National Hospital.

The Grandpass Police and rescue teams are conducting further search operations,” they said.

It was reported that the owner was killed in the incident.

Judicial Medical Officer (JMO) had examined the crash site.

Residents told the Daily Mirror a nearby construction site could have caused the building to collapse. However, it was not confirmed by the JMO.

Meanwhile, the Sri Lanka Air Force soldiers were also deployed to assist in the rescue operations.

Sri Lanka Fire Brigade Acting Divisional Fire Officer (Operation) R.G. Wijesuriya said six fire extinguishers were deployed from Wellawatte, Grandpass and Maradana units.
