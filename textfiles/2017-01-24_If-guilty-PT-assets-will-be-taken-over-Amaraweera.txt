The assets of Perpetual Treasuries (PT) will be acquired by the Government if it was found guilty by the Special Presidential Commission appointed to probe the bond issue, Minister Mahinda Amaraweera told Parliament today.

However, he said it was not easy to probe financial scams and the assistance of experts was needed for this purpose.

"The President will closely monitor the shortcomings of the government just as he was alert to the bond issue," the minister said.

“The previous regime was engaged in large scale frauds and the present government is also engaged in some corruption. Both are equally wrong."

The minister said the opposition has the right to highlight the shortcomings of the government but it should not put the development of the country in jeopardy. (Yohan Perera)
