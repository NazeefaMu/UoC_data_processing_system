Man’s inhumanity to an innocent eagle


	

A photograph in which some men are seen attempting to kill an eagle in an inhumane manner after peeling off its skin and cutting off its legs has gone viral on social media and news websites.

Commenting on the matter, two wildlife organizations, ‘Freedom Sri Lanka Foundation’ and the ‘Let Them Live’ said they would take measures to charge the culprits with inhumane animal slaughter under the Flora and Fauna Protection Ordinance (No.22) of 2009.

“There are five men in the picture. We have identified the men as residents of Wanchawala in Galle. They are engaged in this inhumane act as a hobby. The eagle is an endangered and protected species and cannot be killed or sold,” Shashikalana Ratwatte said on behalf of the wildlife organisations.

He said they have requested the Wildlife Department to take action against the culprits.

The organisations requested people to inform them on phone number 070-3303022 and 071-3664019 in case they had any information on the men seen in the photograph.

Meanwhile, the Wildlife Department said they were in the process of taking legal action against the culprits and added that they could be jailed for up to five years if found guilty. (Darshana Sanjeewa)
