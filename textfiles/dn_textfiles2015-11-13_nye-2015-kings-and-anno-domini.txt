NYE 2015 with Kings and Anno Domini

It's another huge celebration of glitz and glam as Ramada Colombo presents their New Year's Eve party at the Liberty Ballroom. A merry mosaic of festive specials through the month of December all culminate in this huge bash to ring in the New Year.
The party features two of the finest bands in the island - Kings and Anno Domini, who will roll out a great repertoire of hits of the 70's right up to the music of the new millennial. Lead vocals Chandral of Kings and Shehan of Anno Domini each hold their own with a flamboyant style as they sing their way through all-time favourite pop, retro and disco music. By the time the New Year rings in with a champagne toast and a countdown second to none, this party will be in full swing!
The dinner buffet promises to be just awesome. Guests can choose to go west with fine carvery, a selection of delicious Italian and more or stay closer to home with a choice of rich Indian or flavourful oriental dishes. Indulgent desserts will pump up the sugar high to keep these party people energised through the night.
