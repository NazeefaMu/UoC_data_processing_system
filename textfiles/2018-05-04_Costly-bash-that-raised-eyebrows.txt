A prominent opposition politico who started his career as a revolutionary Marxist recently is said to have thrown a grand party at a high-end hotel to celebrate his daughter’s high performance at a national level examination for students.

 


This politico known to have come up from a humble beginning had become a billionaire during his brief stay in high political office, they say. The politico’s onetime colleagues say that with the big money he spent on the bash at this hotel where even a plain hopper costs Rs. 200, he could have built several modest houses for  his poor constituents.
