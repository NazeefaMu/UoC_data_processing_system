(Daily Mail), 22 October 2017 -  Former president Jimmy Carter emerged as an unlikely Donald Trump ally on Sunday, saying that the current commander-in-chief gets a raw deal from the media. Carter, speaking to The New York Times, also said he doesn’t believe Russia swayed ‘any votes’ in the 2016 election, despite its best efforts to interfere with America’s democratic process.    Times columnist Maureen Dowd interviewed Carter at his home in Georgia, and heard one other surprising thought process in the Democrat’s mind: The 93-year-old who was president from 1977 to 1981 would be willing to be Trump’s envoy to North Korea.  


But Carter’s view of how Trump has taken a beating in the press is the column’s biggest revelation.’I think the media have been harder on Trump than any other president certainly that I’ve known about,’ he said.   im that Trump is mentally deranged and everything else without hesitation.
