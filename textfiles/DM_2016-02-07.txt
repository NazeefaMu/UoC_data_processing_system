CSN case: No one will interfere, says Sagala
	
The rule of law would be upheld when perusing the case against former Presidents son Yoshitha Rajapaksa and the others at the Carlton Sports Network (CSN) without any intervention by President Maithripala Sirisena, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe or any of the Cabinet Ministers, Minister of Law Order Sagala Ratnayake said in a statement today.
Minister Ratnayake said that the Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID) had to seek permission from the Judiciary by producing the suspects before Courts to ensure the investigations were carried out effectively.
He said a report of the investigations would be handed over to Attorney General in order to file legal action against the suspects.
He said the suspects were charged with producing forged documents, violating the Registration of Companies Act, misusing State property and violating the Customs Act.
The Minister said FCID had acted under Section 32 and Subsection 109 (05) of the Criminal Procedure Code.

Education Ministry to rope in Intl Schools
	
The Ministry of Education would bring in new regulations for International Schools to bring the education of International Schools under the purview of the Education Ministry, Ministry Secretary W. M. Bandusena said.
The move follows the election manifesto of the Government.
The ministry will focus on the quality of education provided by international schools and facilitate them to upgrade the education of the students studying at international schools, he said.
We have received complaints from authorities of some international schools that they had faced difficulties in certain instances including getting text books on time. They had said that they preferred that International Schools are supervised by the Ministry. Therefore, the Ministry is now focusing on bringing those schools into the mainstream. When they are attached to the State system, they will be monitored by the Ministry, he said.
However, he said the Ministry did not plan to control the International Schools by interfering into the administration of the schools.
He said the regulations would be implemented after several rounds of discussion with the representatives of these schools.
I cannot give an idea of what kind of regulations will be implemented as the process in still at discussion level. But, I can assure that the programme is focusing to facilitate the International Schools since it is the responsible of the Ministry to supervise the education of those who study at these schools, Mr. Bandusena said.
Meanwhile, General Secretary of the Ceylon Teachers Union Joseph Stalin said that the Government should take over all International Schools. (Piyumi Fonseka)

FCID hands over files to AG
	
The Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID) has handed over files to the Attorney General on an investigation done on default loans at Lankaputhra Bank which had exceeded Rs 2 billion.
Lankaputhra Chairman Lasantha Goonewardena said investigations were carried out by the FCID on 17 individuals and organizations who had defaulted loans worth Rs 2 billion. He said the investigations have revealed that loans have been given without following proper procedures few years ago.
He said statements have been recorded from some of the employees at Lankaputhra Bank and the borrowers.
The usual procedure is that the Attorney General files legal action against the suspects while clearance from the Court is sought by the police to arrest them if necessary.
However, Police spokesman ASP Ruwan Gunasekera said he is not aware of any investigation or any impending action against any suspect. (Yohan Perera)

North Korea announces "successful" launch of satellite
	
North Korea has fired a long-range rocket, which critics say is a test of banned missile technology.
A state TV announcer said that North Korea had successfully placed a satellite in orbit.
It appears the rocket was fired from a base in the north-west and passed over Japan's southern Okinawa islands.
The launch was condemned by Japan, South Korea and the US, who have requested an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council later on Sunday.
The North insists its space programme is purely scientific in nature, but the US, South Korea and even ally China say the rocket launches are aimed at developing an inter-continental ballistic missile capable of striking the US.
North Korea has already provoked international criticism this year with a fourth nuclear bomb test on 6 January.
South Korean analysts had speculated that the North might carry out the launch ahead of 16 February, the birthday of the late North Korean dictator Kim Jong Il.
'Serious threats'
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe called the launch "absolutely unacceptable," saying it was a "clear violation" of UN Security Council resolutions.
UN Security Council resolutions ban the state from carrying out any nuclear or ballistic missile tests.
US National Security Adviser Susan Rice said North Korea's use of ballistic missile technology was "yet another destabilizing and provocative action".
"North Korea's missile and nuclear weapons programs represent serious threats to our interests - including the security of some of our closest allies," she said in a statement.
Contenders for the Republican ticket in the US presidential election this year were asked for their reaction during a debate in New Hampshire.
Donald Trump said he would work with China to resolve the North Korea nuclear issue: "I would get on with China. Let China solve that problem. They can do it quickly and surgically. That's what we should do with North Korea."
For his part, Chris Christie said of the North Korean government: "All these people understand is toughness and strength."(BBC)
