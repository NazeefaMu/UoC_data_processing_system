Enrique Iglesias concert: Live Events noticed


	

The Colombo District Court today issued notice on the Live Events Ltd., the organisers of Enrique Iglesias Concert in Colombo, to respond on April 26 over a petition filed by two fans of the concert.

The petitioners- Nishan Premathiratne Attorney at Law and his wife-had earlier sent a letter of demand to Live Events demanding Rs.22 million for “loss, damage and mental stress,” caused during the concert.

Subsequently, the Court issued the notice on the respondents to appear in Court and to consider whether to issue an interim-injunction order on the firm as requested by the petitioners. (Shehan Chamika Silva)
