CID’s IP Nishantha Silva appeals to NPC


	

The CID’s Organised Crimes Investigation Unit OIC Inspector Nishantha Silva who was transferred to the Negombo Division, had appealed to the National Police Commission (NPC) over his transfer.

NPC Secretary Saman Dissanayaka said the Commission would ask for a report from IGP Pujith Jayasundara on this matter.

He said the NPC had not recommended IP Nishantha’s transfer as the CID did not come under the NPC's functional division. The Secretary said the transfer had been made by the IGP.

IP Silva was the OIC of the CID’s Organised Crimes Investigation Unit which is handling investigations into many major incidents including the murder of Editor Lasantha Wickramatunge and the abduction and assault of journalist Keith Noyahr.

IP Silva is known to be heading investigations into at least 60 crimes committed by the LTTE, the rape and murder of student Sivaloganathan Vithya, the abduction of 11 youths in Colombo and Chief of Defence Staff Ravindra Wijegunaratne’s alleged involvement in harbouring a suspect and many more.
