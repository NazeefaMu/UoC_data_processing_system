SAITM CEO shooting a staged hoax: JO


	

The joint opposition yesterday claimed that the Monday night shooting incident in which the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) escaped unhurt was staged.

SAITM CEO Dr. Sameera Senarathne escaped unhurt when his car allegedly came under fire by two men travelling on a motorcycle wearing full-face helmets while he was leaving the SAITM premises in Malabe.

Addressing a news conference MP Jayantha Samaraweera said none of the CCTV cameras in the vicinity of the crime were operative at the time of the shooting.

“This raises serious suspicions about the entire incident,” he said.

Meanwhile, MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara also said that it appeared the shooting had been staged. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
