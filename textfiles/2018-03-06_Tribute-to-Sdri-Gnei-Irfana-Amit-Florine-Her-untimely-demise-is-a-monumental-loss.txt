Tribute to Sdri Gnei Irfana Amit (Florine) Her untimely demise is a monumental loss


	

Saudari Florine was associated with WASLAM since our inauguration in 2010, first as vice-patron and then as Patron.  She was a “hands-on” person who supported and encouraged us in all our projects.  She walked the extra mile to garner donations and with her persuasive techniques never came back empty handed.  She was the live wire of any event and kept the momentum going with her witty and active participation. She was a vibrant personality. When the music started she would take to the floor and her voice echoed in the “sing a long.” Her absence will be greatly felt by all of us.    Not only was Saudari  Florine a prominent participant in all activities connected with the Malays but she was also of service to the community at large. Her untimely demise is a monumental loss to WASLAM and I am sure her absence will be felt by all the institutions she was closely connected with.


We extend our heartfelt condolence to her beloved husband, Laddie, to her children and to their families.
