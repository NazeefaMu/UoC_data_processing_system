Some of them are still half-hearted!


	



 

The Betel leaf dissident group in yahapalanaya has again split over the question of quitting the government.

 


Two of the three senior purohitas in this group – one from the gem city area and the other – a loving one – from the Colombo district have put their foot down that they cannot remain with a sense of self-respect in yahapalanaya after this month. However, the senior one from Wayamba who once held secretarial status in the Blue party has now come round to the view that they should give up the idea of quitting yahapalanaya and resume efforts to unite the two factions. Meanwhile, the majority of other dissidents – purohitas of lesser ranks and backbenchers-  hold fast to the view that they should quit. 


By the way, the radical faction within the dissident group has decided to cross over to the opposition after September 20 come hell or high water, they say.
