[APPRECIATIONS - (19-Oct-2015)]

INDRA WICKRAMASINGHE :
He was a jack of all trades
I write this in appreciation of a man, who ably supported by my mother, instilled in me the values that guide my role in society, and in my resolve to honour his memory. Three years had crept by, the pain lingers, but the lessons learnt over many years still serve as pathway lights in my journey into the future.
My father was a public servant, an officer of the Ceylon Administrative Service, and a strict disciplinarian even with the four of us children. Looking back, I feel it has held us in good stead. Any task he undertook was accomplished with passionate fervour.
He was a stickler for detail and a stringent observer of punctuality. He valued hard work, self-reliance, integrity, and bid us do the same. He was a jack of all trades, and ensured that my three brothers in particular learnt skills they would find handy later in life. Being the only daughter in the family made little difference, although I could never master the intricacies of fixing a brake plate in the car despite acting as his "junior mechanic" on numerous occasions.
Idealism, disillusionment, and also as my mother opines, his stubbornness in refusing to consult his influential friends resulted in his early retirement from the public service at a turning point in his career when he could have continued to reach its zenith.
The most profound memories of my father are stories of how he never abandoned people at risk of facing danger. On travels between his outstation posts and Colombo in the 60s and 70s, he had on several instances personally intervened to stop a violent street brawl and carry seriously injured men to the nearest hospital in his car, going way beyond his call of duty.
His personality was such that when the occasion required he could severely intimidate the most notorious thugs into meekness merely with his booming voice and courageous bearing and an attitude that could only have been driven by a powerful sense of righteousness. Even in his mid-70s, I was once momentarily at a loss when he attempted to scale an iron gate in a house to rush to the aid of its elderly occupant, a stranger to us, who had tripped and knocked his head on the paved garden.
An incident during his funeral remains etched in my mind. A string-hopper seller in the neighbourhood visited our home in Dehiwela to pay his respects and lamented that he had come to know only too late about my father who had served in his village in Baddegama many years ago.
He recounted seeing my father - who could not swim a stroke - braving the rage of Gin Ganga floods to lead food distribution operations in boats, ensuring that all government supplies reached the hapless families. While listening, I suddenly recalled an event my father related, how during these floods when the divisional office had to await boats from Colombo, he had sat through an entire cold night under a makeshift hut lit by a few kerosene lanterns helping an engineer fix a damaged boat so that it could be used to distribute relief supplies the very next morning.
In his public service career, he was never one to wait for things to happen, but the catalyst who made things happen. The string-hopper vendor said he remembered these events from 45 years ago as a young boy because the image of a young, energetic civil servant immaculately dressed in white trousers and long sleeved shirt in the thick of things had deeply impressed the flood-ravaged villagers as being genuinely empathetic towards them. As the daughter of a public servant, myself being one, I could not have been prouder.
A week after his passing, I picked up the last book he had been reading, from the exact spot it had been left on the cane stool when the illness overcame him and it was no longer possible to indulge in his cherished pursuit. It was a two-volume leather-bound book titled The Spirit of Laws by Montesquieu and the Social Contract by Rousseau.
A few pages into the book and tears welled in my eyes, partly out of regret for not heeding my father's exhortations to delve into such classics so that we may spend hours dissecting and discussing the complexities and nuances of their wisdom.
I shall despair these lost opportunities monumentally, for I am yet to come across a person who could offer the same intellectual succour or possessed the remarkable ability to impart life's lessons as appropriate, to people of various stations, young and old, who sought his counsel.
Thaththi, in his student days, was an accomplished scholar and an athlete,and had won the Wesley College coveted Hill Medal in 1951. My mother's efforts to preserve the number of trophies he had won were futile, as he had the habit of using them in his various carpentry and motor mechanic hobbies only to be discarded when their utility value waned.
He was a fine orator in both English and Sinhala languages and had held many an audience spell bound during his career days. Despite his tough personality, he was greatly sensitive towards unfortunate circumstances of ordinary people as well as animals. As children, we kept many pets but learnt they needed their own space as well. Even a few little fish had to have a large tank so that their movements were not restricted. On two occasions, in a feat that amazed our neighbours, he rallied my brothers to trap poisonous cobras that had stealthily moved into our garden from the thicket behind our home and release them safely into the wild.
Having no experience with snakes of any kind, and relying solely on his wits to formulate a humane way of trapping them, his only desire would have been to prevent unnecessary harm to these creatures of nature while protecting us as well. Growing up, it was these experiences that shaped my views on the liberties and freedoms of beast as well as of man.
My father was proud when each of his four children scored achievements in life. And having resolved early in our childhood not to spoon feed us, he was prouder when he knew that behind these achievements lay great personal effort and initiative on our part. It was his philosophy to expect us to make best use of whatever resources my parents gave us to shape our destinies. Years into my future, inadvertently or not, I will continue to draw inspiration from the beliefs and convictions of my father.
Thinking of him, I am reminded of a quote I read somewhere, sometime: "There are men; and then there are lions among men". One such was our father.
May Thaththi attain the Supreme Bliss of Nibbana !

EARDLEY PERERA, PC:
His generosity was limitless
October 20, 2015 marks the 90th birth anniversary of President's Counsel Eardley Perera. He was an outstanding criminal lawyer with a brilliant mind.
He was also a warm, generous and a sincere human being. He had a magnetic personality that drew people to him.
All who knew him, loved him. I had the privilege of knowing him as a friend. Today as I reflect on his life, I wish to pen a few thoughts about Eardley from the perspective of a friend.
My friendship with Eardley began in 1950 when he visited my filling station to seek my advice on a matter regarding a car.
I felt a rapport with him right away which I later recognised as one of Eardley's many unique qualities. He could effortlessly connect with people from all walks of life. From then on, our acquaintance developed into a friendship that lasted for over 50 years.
Though we were poles apart in academics, sport and fame, our friendship flourished. When I was admitted to St. Sebastian's College, Moratuwa in 1942, Eardley had already left to join St. Joseph's College, Colombo to pursue higher studies, and as such, I cannot claim to have known him at school. Having obtained a first division in the London Matriculation Examination, he joined the Law College in Colombo and passed out as an Advocate of the Supreme Court of Ceylon in 1948. Though an old Joe, he preferred to call himself a Sebastianite for as long as I remember.
Eardley married Shirley in 1956 and I married Ruth in 1959. Our wives cemented our friendship even further. Although Eardley and Ruth are no longer with us, I make sure to visit Shirley from time to time and talk about our good old days. This cheers us both. Both Shirley and Ruth loved to sing. This meant that our parties were highly memorable occasions with music and dancing. Eardley and Shirley were great hosts; they had an open house where all were welcome.
They often included us even in their family functions. We in turn had countless parties that often lasted till the wee hours of the morning with dancing and singing around the piano.
Eardley loved every minute of it.
Eardley's generosity was limitless. He was someone who shared even his friends. Ruth's job required her to go on circuit, and being a woman traveling to different parts of the island, she didn't always feel comfortable to stay overnight at outstation hotels. Eardley solved the problem by introducing us to many of his lawyer friends from all over the country where Ruth could feel comfortable and safe.
As a result many of their good friends became our friends too. Similarly, when our children started school, Eardley insisted that they travel with his own children in their car rather than taking the school bus. Eardley's children who were equally large hearted, happily took our children on board when their car was already full, not just with Eardley's children but also his sisters' children.
Eardley was also humble enough to receive help from others when he needed it. He instinctively knew the right person to go to on any matter, even when it involved legal affairs. I recall an instance from the early 60's when Sri Lanka nationalised the oil industry. During this time, the oil companies were required to hand over all stock for valuation. A depot superintendent of one of the companies was found to have a large shortage.
The company dismissed the man and filed action against him without thorough investigation. Eardley defended the superintendent. Me being in the oil trade, Eardley asked for my advice. I suggested that he ask the person who carried out the investigation whether he realised that the soil in that area was sandy. This being the case, the tank containing the oil could shift, and that could lead to a wrong reading. As a corrective measure, I advised that they use a spirit level to confirm whether the tank was perfectly horizontal. I do not know to what extent Eardley used this advice, but subsequently, the defendant was acquitted.
Both Eardley and Shirley were extremely mindful of the poor. Shirley went to great lengths to make life a little better for the poorest of the poor.
It was common practice on the last Sunday of the month for beggars who came for alms to be given a scrub and a bath. One domestic would hold the hose while another gave a scrub. Following the bath, they were given a new set of clothes and a scrumptious lunch. Shirley also had the practice of donating wheel chairs to needy individuals and organisations.
Eardley had a remarkable ability to make others feel important. People felt comfortable and at ease with him. It was always a pleasure to be around him. Not just his family, friends and colleagues, but even the domestic staff and chauffeurs were treated with respect and dignity. It seemed that his Catholic faith had a very real grip on him. His life demonstrated the famous words that many people remember from the American Declaration of Independence that are sometimes attributed to President Thomas Jefferson, that "all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness."
Today we remember Eardley for many things. He was an inspirational figure who profoundly impacted all who came into contact with him. He worked extremely hard, yet he loved his work so much that it didn't seem like work to him. He excelled in his craft. He lived a life of generosity. It might even be a good day for those in his field, to visit the Colombo Law Library and view the bust that stands in his honour, and be inspired. Eardley Perera died on December 30, 2004. The children invited me to be one of the pallbearers. As I stood with my hand on the casket I was acutely aware that this was the passing of a Sri Lankan legend who I had the privilege to call friend.

LIONEL GANGE:
A simple man with a big heart
Lionel Gange, the social and religious worker, humanist and down to earth personality is no more.
He breathed his last about two weeks back after a brief illness. His demise was sudden and never expected by his family members and close friends.
He was a very popular and prominent personality in and around Boralasgamuwa and the vast crowd that thronged his residence and Nedimala cemetery was testimony to his popularity.
He was a charming and simple man whose life was dedicated to various associations and welfare activities, specially his alma mater Sri Sumangala Maha Vidyalaya, Hikkaduwa.
He was a live wire at school activities, be it the Old Boys' Association events, prize givings, sports meets and school development activities.
He was also a follower and ardent supporter of cricket. He was a regular writer of articles for daily newspapers on cricket and a mobile library on cricket history.
He was very enthusiastic to take part in social activities of relatives, neighbours and friends. The vacuum that has been created due to his sudden death can never be filled. His death was sudden, but his life was not faint.
His memory will always be with us and his legacy will continue through his children. A great friend of many, we are grateful for having known you.
As for me I have lost a relative, a good friend and above all a simple man with a big heart. May his sojourn in Sansara be short and be blessed with the supreme bliss of Nibbana.

L.D.Dickman:
Loved by everyone
L.D. Dickman, Senior Town Planner and Fellow ITPSL passed away recently after having been ill for some time. Despite being ill, Dickman never lost his spirits or his sense of humour and entertained everyone who visited him at his residence to inquire after his health.
Dickman was extraordinary in many ways. He continued to work despite his physical disability. Anyone else would have taken complete rest from work but not Dickman. What inspired Dickman to be different? A historical sketch of the family indicates that the young Dickman accompanied his mother to the temple every poya day and observed sil along with her on every such occasion.
His religious upbringing perhaps enabled him to let go the past and live very much in the present- one of the cardinal principles of the Buddhist philosophy.
Dickman seems to have entertained socialist ideas very early in life. He turned out to be a firebrand socialist during his university days and continued to voice the plight of the economically under privileged. Dickman was a willing participant in all demonstrations against social injustices and never hesitated to show his protest against such real or perceived atrocities.
I came to know Dickman when he joined the then Katubedda Campus of the University of Sri Lanka to pursue a course of study leading to the M.Sc.in Town and Country Planning in 1975.
Dickman at that time possessed a B.Sc. degree in Public Administration from the then Vidyodaya Campus of the University of Sri Lanka. Prior to joining Moratuwa he worked as a research assistant at the Marga Institute where he worked from 1972 to 1975.
Dickman was a very enthusiastic participant in the M.Sc. degree programme but retained his strong views on politics. Responding to a question from the British external examiner at the final M.Sc. dissertation examination he strongly criticised what he referred to as imperialism and hegemony to the amusement of everybody. However he passed the final examination hands down.
After obtaining the M.Sc. degree in Town and Country Planning (1997) Dickman joined the Colombo Master Plan Project under the UNDP as a physical planner and acquired valuable experience in various aspects of physical planning. Identification of new town projects, action programmes on town improvement projects, preparation of a regional structure plan and action programmes for metro schools were some of his assignments.
After completion of two years on the job, he joined the Board of Investment (BOI) as a manager in 1979 and continued in the post till 1986. Thereafter he continued to hold several top posts in the BOI- Additional Senior Manager 1986/90, Director Regional Development 1990/99 and Executive Director1999/2005. Thereafter he was promoted as Deputy Director General Infra structure in 2005 and continued in that post till the end of 2009.
He thereafter left the BOI and joined Lanka Mirigama Special Economic Zone (PLC) as Deputy General Manager in2010/11 and thereafter served Vallibel (PLC) as General Manager 2011/14. Dickman indeed had a marvellous career as a planner, manager and administrator in planning related assignments.
Dickman was also keen to pursue his academic interests and found time off his busy schedule to work with the universities. He functioned as a visiting lecturer in Town Planning in the Faculty of Management of the Sri Jayawardenapura University and also in the Department of Town and Country Planning of the Moratuwa University. Additionally he was a Council member of the Chamber of Construction Industry.
Dickman visited many countries and attended meetings, conferences, workshops and forums on a number of issues related to his profession. These inter-alia comprised investment promotion, industrial zones, IT parks and urban property development.
As a town planner he made available his services to the Institute of Town Planners at all times. He was the inaugural Treasurer of the ITPSL and continued in that position for a number of years. He also served the ITPSL in many other positions at different times. These comprise council member, Assistant Secretary 1989/90, President Elect 2007/09 and President 2009/11.
Throughout his career, Dickman had been a very dedicated worker. He had been noted for his intelligence, diligence and hard working nature. He had in fact received letters of commendation from two different Director Generals of the BOI in 1994 and 1998.
Despite his numerous professional obligations pertaining to his profession he was indeed totally devoted to his family. He was in fact a very affectionate husband to Puspha. She in turn was a very courageous and devoted wife who did everything in her power to save Dickman's life.
Their son Binuka and daughter Paba were very fond of the father who doted on them throughout until his untimely death. He was proud of his children who did well in their studies and advanced as young professionals. Both children are now happily married.
Dickman was indeed a cheerful person and loved by everyone. May he attain the bliss of Nibbana.

Desmond Dharmarajah :
A big brother to his friends
"Lives of great men all remind us, we can make our lives sublime, and, departing, leave behind us, footprints on the sands of time." Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.
We were deeply saddened to hear of the sudden passing away of our dear friend Desmond Dharmarajah on October 6, 2015.
Desmond had his education at St. Peter's college. He was an outstanding sportsman and represented his college in both cricket and rugby football. He also represented the mercantile sector in hockey and basket ball.
He was a big brother to his friends and was looked up to with a lot of love and affection. He always stood tall, standing by his principles and in more recent times spent many a Sunday morning together reminiscing on the days gone by.
What strikes me most when I remember Desmond is that he was a man of God. I'm not saying that because he was a church goer and held office at the Mirihana church but because of the life he lead.
And as we read in Micah 6: 8 ...what does the LORD require of you.. but to do justice, and to love kindness and to walk humbly with your God ? amply describes Desmond. He was a devout family man, a proud grand father and a true and loyal friend. He will be missed not only by his wife Violet and children Darrel, Dalrene , Russel and their families but by all of us who knew him. And how we wish that he would have been there to celebrate their golden wedding anniversary in January. But it was not to be and he was gone before we knew it. And yet he was ready to meet his maker.
"For when the One Great Scorer comes to write against your name, He writes - not that you won or lost - but how you played the game."
May the turf lie gently on you and may the holy angels welcome you to your heavenly abode.
Friend of the family
