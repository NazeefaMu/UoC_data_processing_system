Taking the message of ‘High Speed Claim’ to the customers is cricketer Rangana Herath, who has collaborated with Janashakthi Insurance to launch this unique service product, which further enhances Janashakthi’s Full Option brand.


‘High Speed Claim’ clearly differentiates itself as the most convenient and beneficial motor claims product in the market, backed by the solid support of a dedicated customer care team. 


In the event of an accident, the Full Option policyholder has only to call the Janashakthi hotline, which will dispatch an assessor to the accident site.
