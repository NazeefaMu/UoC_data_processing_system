Minister of Ports and shipping Arjuna Ranathunga submitted nominations to contest as the vice president of the Sri Lanka Cricket Board at the next election to be held in January.
Minister Ranatunga said he got requests from around the country to contest for the presidency of the SLC but he decided to contest for the vice presidency as he was not eligible to contest for the presidency.
“I have to be in the executive committee for two years to serve as the president. I could have gone to the Minister, president or the Prime Minister and get permission but that is not the way I follow. I will have to wait till I get eligible,” he said.
Minister Ranatunga said he decided to contest the SLC election as he was concerned with school cricket and that he wanted to promote school cricket and get it into a different level.
