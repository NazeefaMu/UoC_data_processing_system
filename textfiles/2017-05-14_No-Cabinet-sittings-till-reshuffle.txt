President Maithripala Sirisena had stopped all Cabinet meetings until a Cabinet reshuffle, sources said.

Government sources had told our sister paper Lankadeepa, that President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe had agreed to reshuffle the current Cabinet of Ministers after the return of the Prime Minister from China.

They had also agreed upon the matter at a meeting they had had before the Prime Minister's China visit, sources said.

The proposed Cabinet reshuffle has soured the relationship between the United National Party (UNP) and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) in the Government.

It is learnt that several SLFP Parliamentarians had informed the President that they would be compelled to act as an independent group by August, unless the issues that had cropped up between the two parties in the Government were resolved.

It is also learnt that the President had rejected a request by them to review the MoU between the United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) and the UNP and stated that he would take a decision to establish discipline within his party, the SLFP, in the near future.
