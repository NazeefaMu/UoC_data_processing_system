Numerical values and vibrations-  key to discover your potential


	



 

 

Numerology or Swar Shastra, the ancient science based on numbers and resonance value attributed to them, says that you are born with a set of numerical values that represent vibrational frequencies that go a long way in shaping your life and destiny. It is your date of birth that gives you first a set of numerical values. Another set of numerical value is created by the name you are given. 

 

Numerical value of name and date of birth
The overall numerical value of name and the date of birth forms a design and a blueprint that can reveal one’s potentialities.


Some people have two or more names.  And now the question arises as to whether all names or one of them should be taken into account in determining the numerical value. 

 

Identifying name carrying numerical value
According to both Western and Hindu numerologists the name that should be considered for determining the numerical value is the name that is commonly used to identify a person.


It is said that the Hindu works on Numerology have prescribed an experiment to determine the name that is commonly used to identify a person. 


The experiment is as follows: You enter a room or a hall where about twenty to thirty people are fast asleep. You softly call out the commonly used name of a person among them. The person who wakes up in response to the call, when all other are still fast asleep really owns the name and it is that name that should be taken into account in determining the numerical value. 


According to Western numerologists the Christian name or the surname whichever is commonly used should be taken into account in determining the numerical value.

 

The formula widely accepted as most effective
There are several formulas giving numerical value to the sounds or syllables reduced to the letters of the English alphabet. However, we wish to give a mix of two formulas, the Sumerian and the Pythagorean which great numerologists have found to be yielding the most satisfactory results.  


1 = A, I, J, Q, Y
2 = B, K, R
3 = C, G, L, S 
4 = D, M, T 
5 = E, H, N, S
6 = U, V, W
7 = O, Z
8= F, P


You will note that the Sumerian formula does not take 9 for reckoning the numerical value.
Accordingly, numerical value of the name SIRISENA is follows:


S = 3
I = 1
R = 2
I = 1
S = 3
E = 5
N = 5
A = 1
         -
      21
      =   
Life Path Number


The total numerical value of the name is arrived at by adding the numerical values of the letters, may not be in harmony with the Destiny Number derived from the numerical value of the birth of date. 
Some numerologists describe the number representing the total numerical value of one’s name as the Life Path Number.


If the Life Path Number is not identical with a number signifying a favourable effect, the person concerned can suitably change the name in such manner as to obtain a favourable numerical value.
