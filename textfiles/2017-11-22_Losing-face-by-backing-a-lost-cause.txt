Losing face by backing a lost cause


	



 

A Green party purohita who recently secured an audience with Number One expressed his unhappiness over blocking a particular news website. 

 


The purohita argued that blocking or banning websites was not advisable at a time when they were concentrating on digitization and besides, it was unfair to block one that supported them at a critical time. 


Number One who gave the purohita an attentive hearing later angrily demanded why those holding a brief for the website in question were keeping quiet when it was slandering him and his family members. “They can’t play with me the kind of games they played with the former boss.  I know who are behind vilifying me and my family!” 


The purohita soon bade goodbye to Number One realizing that further arguments with him in his nasty mood would serve no purpose.
