A suggestion to site his office where his heart is


	


This purohita is well known for his love for the environment and his great reverence for the ancient Buddhist shrines and devalayas. He is said to be spending more of his time visiting such sacred places than at public functions. He has also claimed that he had occasion to sight even devatas (deities) at some sacred places during his visits.
When the highest council of Yahapalanya met the other day, this purohita complained that he had yet to find a suitable place to open his office.
Then a high yahapalanaya authority told him that he could suggest an ideal place for him to set up his office.
“Where?” the purohita eagerly asked the bigwig. 
“Either at Somawatiya or at Kebilitta Devalaya,” replied the bigwig. 
 The purohita looked down bashfully as ripples of amusement passed through other purohitas.
