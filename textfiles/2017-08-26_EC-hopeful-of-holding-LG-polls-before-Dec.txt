With the enactment of the Local Authorities’ Elections (Amendment) Bill, the Election Commission has reportedly deemed it possible to conduct the polls prior to the GCE Ordinary Level Examinations in December this year.

Earlier, the government said the polls, overdue by more than two years, would be conducted in December this year or in January next year.

For the first time, these elections will be conducted under a mix of the First-Past-the-Post-System and the Proportional Representation System. (Kelum Bandara)
