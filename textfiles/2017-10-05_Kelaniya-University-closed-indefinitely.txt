The Kelaniya University was closed indefinitely from today with immediate effect following a clash with two students groups this morning, Head of the Department of Mass Communication Professor Rohana Lakshman Piyadasa told the Daily Mirror.

However, the Medical Faculty would continue to function as usual he said.

Speaking to the Daily Mirror he said the clash between two groups occurred last night and this morning.

The decision to close the University was arrived at a meeting held by the Senate following the clash.  

“The clash could not be resolved despite several rounds of discussion held between the two rivaling student groups. Several students have been hospitalised,” Professor Piyadasa said.

“The campus has been declared out of bounds for all students except medical students,” he said.

He also said the science exhibition, which was now on to mark the 20th Anniversary of the University had been cancelled due to the closure of the university.

According to Police Media Division the clashes followed following some Arts Faculty students damaging the banners of the Medical exhibition.

They also said five students had been admitted to the Kiribathgoda Hospital last night. (Chaturanga Pradeep)
