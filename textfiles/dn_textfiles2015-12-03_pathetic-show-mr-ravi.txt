Pathetic show by MR - Ravi

It was a pathetic situation that Kurunegala District Parliamentarian and former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, avoided to join the second reading debate on the budget while taking a salary of Rs. 349,000, including allowances, Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said in Parliament yesterday.
He said that it was a matter to be sad that although Mahinda Rajapaksa did not speak in Parliament, he spoke at temples concerning the budget.
He made this observation in reply to the members who joined the second reading debate on the budget proposals for financial year 2016.
Karunanayake said that Rajapaksa had been taking a payment of Rs. 97,000 as pension on the Presidential portfolio since March this year. He said Rajapaksa is also taking the salary of an MP which is Rs. 54,000. He also questioned as to what would happen if an ordinary public servant obtained two salaries from public funds?
The minister said that Rajapaksa had a responsibility to join the debate as he was the former President as well as the former Finance Minister.
He said that his behaviour was a disrespect to the voters who voted to him.
