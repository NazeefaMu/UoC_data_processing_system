President under pressure over SAITM: GMOA


	

Some ministers are pressuring President Maithripala Sirisena to refrain from taking over the Malabe South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (Private) Limited (SAITM), the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) claimed today.

GMOA Media Secretary Dr. Samantha Ananda told a media briefing that though the President has the authority to nationalize the ‘medical degree shop’, he was being urged not to do so by some ministers with vested interested in SAITM.

He said 2016 will be the turning point of the medical education and the health sector in Sri Lanka and it was high time for the President and the Prime Minister to take a final decision on the SAITM controversy. (Piyumi Fonseka)
