Air Force make Police fight hard for 24/12 win

Police Sports Club scraped through to a hard fought win against a fighting Air Force outfit by 24 points ( 3 tries, 3 conversions, 1 penalty) to 12 (2 tries, 1 conversion) in their Dialog 'A' Division league rugby second round match played at Police Park yesterday. Police led 10-nil at the breather.
After a tremendous fight for supremacy by both teams to put the points on board, Police were successful in doing so in the latter stage of the first half when in the 39th minute the referee awarded a penalty.
Their nippy scrum half Sudam Sooriarachchi took a quick tap and sliced through the Air Force defence to score a superb try. Full back Reeza Mubarak made the conversion and Police went into a 7-0 lead.
Just on the stroke of half time Police received a penalty for an infringement by Air Force and their reliable kicker Mubarak made no mistake with a 30 metre penalty to increase their tally to 10-0 at the half.
Immediately on resumption in the 46th minute Police captain cum second row forward Chanaka Udara picked up a loose ball from a ruck and dived over mid left for their second try of the match. Once again Mubarak fired across the conversion and the score stretched to 17-0.
In the 65th minute of the game Police won a line out in their 22 metre line and off the ensuing rolling maul, their gigantic number eight Radeesha Ranjan scored one of his trade mark tries of the ongoing rugby season. Mubarak who had an outstanding game and a 100% record with his boot, put over the conversion once more and Police went ahead further to a 24-0 lead. After this set back the Airmen finally got their act together and opened scoring in the 80th minute, when off a quick tap Isuru Jayaratna crashed through for a try mid right. National centre and last year's Air Force skipper Charith Seneviratne fired across the conversion and the score read 24-7 in favour of Police.
In the 82nd minute of the game Police star number eight Radeesha Ranjan was sent off the field for unwarranted play where he obtained his second yellow card of the match.
In the dying stages, Air Force worked their three quarter line wide; to enable their cracking full back Nuwan Perera to form the overlap by joining the line and dart across the field for a brilliant try far right covering nearly 35 metres. Seneviratne surprisingly fluffed the conversion.
