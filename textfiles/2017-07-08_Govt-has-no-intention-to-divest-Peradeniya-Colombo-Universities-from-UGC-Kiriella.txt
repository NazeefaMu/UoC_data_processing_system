Higher Education Minister Lakshman Kiriella said yesterday the government had not taken any decision to divest the Colombo and Peradeniya universities from the purview of the University Grant Commission (UGC).

He said this in response to a question asked by JVP MP Nalinda Jayatissa whether the government was planning to remove these universities from UGC administration and make them income-generating independent institutions.

The minister said the government had not even thought of such a move and rejected the allegations.

The MP said the matter had been did discussed by a committee attended by MP Ashu Marasinghe and university heads.

The minister said various proposals were made by oversight committees but they could not be considered as government proposals.

"There may have been a discussion at the oversight committee. Various proposals are made at oversight committees to enhance education. But it is not the policy of the government. Government’s policy is not discussed there," he said. (Ajith Siriwardana)
