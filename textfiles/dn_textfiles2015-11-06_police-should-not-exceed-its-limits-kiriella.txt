The Police should not exceed its limits: Kiriella

Leader of the House and Highways and Higher Education Minister Lakshman Kiriella today said that he also agrees that the way Police handled the situation during the HNDA protest was wrong.
He was addressing a press conference at the Parliamentary Complex.
“The Police should not exceed its limits. Even the Opposition Leader pointed out the fact that the retreating students were attacked. Now an investigation is on over this incident. We have no power to give orders to the Police. The Police is now independent unlike the period of the previous regime” he observed.
The Minister also rejected the claim that the officials of the Ministry were not available to meet the students who were protesting at Ward Place on October 29. 
“It was wrong to say like that. The Police officers who came in to the Ministry discussed with the Ministry officials and went out to call five students in for discussion. However they did not return with the students, and the baton of one Police officer is still inside the Ministry premises. We are ready to meet the students at any time. We are committed to address their grievances” he noted.
The Minister added that the cabinet approval was given to grant degree equivalence the HNDA. “This does not mean that they would be offered degrees, but their qualification is recognized on par with the degree as it had been the case since 1990 until 2014” he explained.
The minister also emphasized that the University system needs to be made independent in order to develop them, adding that the Vice Chancellors should be free to take independent decisions.
“Over the past years, political interferences were abundant in the university education system. This could be seen even when appointing the Vice Chancellors. The Universities degraded to the level of colleges. A university must be a free place to organize various dialogues and present new ideas. We are trying to create a new culture. It cannot be achieved overnight. When the 19th Amendment to the Constitution was formed we wanted to include the UGC also as an independent commission, but the proposal had to be dropped as some parties were against it. When we are formulating a new Constitution we will present this proposal again” he commented.
The minister further said the present Government led by the Prime Minister and the President has the will to operate the law properly and effectively in the country.  
“We need to build a new country. A national government has been formed to find solutions to the key problems and create the policy framework required by the country. That framework will be a permanent one and it will be our gift to the future generation. The both parties which were ruling the country since the independence are responsible for the national question. We are striving to continue the national government at least for two years in order to achieve the stipulated goals” he said.
Responding to a question by a journalist on the SAITM medical degree, the minister stated the matter is being discussed, adding that an amicable solution would be reached through negotiation and careful consideration of all facts.  
“The issue of SAITM too was created by the former government. At that time, I inquired from Minister S B Dissanayake how a medical college be run without a teaching hospital. Since it has already started now, we have to think about the students who have enrolled in it too. This has been established under an Act approved in Parliament” he pointed out.
The minister also queried whether it is fair to object to the private universities, when students pass the A-L exam and enter the Universities with the help of private tuitions.
“Let us face the reality. Some of our medical students are studying at various foreign universities in which the standards are below the SAITM. Only about 15 percent of our students are admitted to state universities. What happens to the rest of 85 percent? We have to think about their future too” he commented.
