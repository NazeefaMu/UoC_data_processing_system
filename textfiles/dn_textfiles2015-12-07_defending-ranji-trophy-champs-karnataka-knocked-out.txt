Defending Ranji trophy champs Karnataka knocked out

Karnataka's 2015-16 Ranji Trophy campaign came to a disappointing end as the defending champions crashed out of the tournament following a 53-run loss against Maharashtra on Friday.
Vidarbha, who secured an innings victory against Haryana, entered the quarters in style as they finished as the toppers from Group A. Bengal and Assam, who played out a draw, were the other teams to qualify from Group A.
Mumbai drew their game against Gujarat and finished as the toppers from Group B while it was yet another disappointment for the Parthiv Patel-led side as they were knocked out by Mumbai for the third time in the last four seasons.
Punjab, who had secured a win against Tamil Nadu on day two and Madhya Pradesh, who defeated Andhra by an innings on Thursday, were the other teams to qualify for the knock-outs from Group B.
