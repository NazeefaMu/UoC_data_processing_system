The Lanka Indian Oil Corporation (LIOC) also announced a reduction in petrol and diesel prices with effect from tonight in line with the fuel price reduction announced by Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CEYPETCO) tonight.

They said that according to the revision the price of Lanka Auto Diesel was reduced by Rs.7 per litre and Lanka Petrol (Octane 92) was reduced by Rs.5 per litre.

This means that a litre of Lanka Petrol (Octane 92) will now be sold at Rs.148. Meanwhile, a litre of Lanka Auto Diesel will now be sold at Rs.111 by LIOC

XtraPremium 95 (Euro 4) Petrol will be sold at Rs.167, reduced by Rs.5 per litre,

while a litre of Super Diesel (Euro 4) will be sold at Rs.136, a reduction of Rs.5.

It was announced that XtraPremium (Euro 3) will be sold at Rs.152 a litre, an increase of Rs.6 per litre.

The company stated that the price reduction was done although LIOC was incurring huge losses on the sale of auto fuel in the Sri Lankan market. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)
