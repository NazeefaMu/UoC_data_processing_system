Blessing of New Grotto and Chapel of Our Lady of Lourdes on Feb.3


	



 

A new Chapel and Grotto was built according to the vision of Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith. This newly built church and grotto will be blessed on February 3, 2018 at 4.30 p.m. This chapel and grotto resemble the grotto of Our Lady of Lourdes in France. The grotto and the Chapel will give the opportunity for the faithful to pray and meditate in peace.   


 This whole project had been planned by Rev. Fr. Darrel Coonghe, who is the director of ‘Supuwath Arana’ and the construction was supervised by Mr. Joseph Palawatte. This entire project was completed at an estimated cost of Rs.100 million and made possible by a donation  by Mclarens Ltd., CEO Rohan De Silva and his wife.   


The purpose of this project is to help the faithful, who would then gather there to pray in peace and to promote the devotion to Mother Mary and to emulate the values of Mother Mary in their lives. The lighting and the landscaping has been done in such a way that everyone who comes there may not be distracted from their prayers. There are confessionals made so that faithful who wish to make their confessions can do so easily. A stream adds more beauty and meaning as one crosses it as a symbol of cleansing after they have made their confessions. This reminds us of ‘Rosa Mystica’ where there is a stream through which the faithful are invited to cross over.   


 The Cardinal has requested the deans of the deaneries to organize a liturgical service on the first Saturday of every month with the faithful and the priests. A candle-light procession with bucket lanterns and the recitation of the rosary will also help to create a prayerful atmosphere. The Mysteries of the rosary have been painted on walls to add more serenity to the place. A group of volunteers have been organized to facilitate the faithful who come there for prayers.   


The building of the grotto and the chapel dedicated to Our Lady of Lourdes at Tewatte in Ragama and the spiritual renewal of the faithful who gather there to ponder and emulate the life of Mother Mary, will help to bring back an answer to those groups who leave out the Marian devotion from their lives.
