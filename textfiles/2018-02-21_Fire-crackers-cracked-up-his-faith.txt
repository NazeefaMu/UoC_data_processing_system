Several Blue heavyweights in the shaky yahapalanaya are set to cross over to the opposition. They are also expected to throw in their lot with the former strongman.

 


Meanwhile, the Betel leaf secretarial one hailing from the deep South who had all along stood for party unity has recently decided not to have any relationship with the Pohottuwa faction in future, 
they say.


Curious why the secretarial one had suddenly developed an antipathy towards the former boss and his crowd, one colleague had inquired from him the cause for his 
volte-face. 


After much insistence the secretarial one had told him: “Machang, they ought to know that I am not a nonentity in our alliance and have some regard at least for my position.”  Prodded on, he had continued: “Firecrackers started exploding in the front yard of my house soon after the first few election results were announced…  I soon found out that it was the henchmen of our former boss who were throwing them into our compound… How can I have any truck with people who tried to humiliate me in this fashion?”
