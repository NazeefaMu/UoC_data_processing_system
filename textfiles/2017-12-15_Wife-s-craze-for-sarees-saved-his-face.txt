Wife’s craze for sarees saved his face!


	



A politico at national level had got highly excited over a prediction by an astrologer that a high political office was in the offing for him. 


And he had decided that he should seek the divine blessings to ensure the prediction come true at the earliest possible instead of passively waiting for it to happen in an uncertain future. So he quietly visited a popular Kovil in a neighboring country to offer a special pooja seeking divine intervention for the prediction to materialize with the least delay.


Before leaving the ambitious politico had casually mentioned to a colleague that he was planning to go abroad without giving an inkling of the purpose of his intended visit.


On arrival at the Kovil the politico had the biggest ever unpleasant surprise in his life when he suddenly came face to face with his colleague there.


However, quite used to play-acting, the politico had immediately covered up his confusion with a cleverly contrived show of his pleasure at meeting him. “Don’t you know, Machang, my wife is crazy about new and varied sarees. So after doing some shopping, I thought of visiting this place by the way,” he had told his friend.
Cursing the colleague under breath for spoiling his plan for the day, the politico had soon left the Kovil premises.


However, he had returned to the Kovil the following day and conducted the special pooja and observed all other rites happily, assured that there was no unwelcome familiar face anywhere near or in the Kovil premises, sources close to him said.
