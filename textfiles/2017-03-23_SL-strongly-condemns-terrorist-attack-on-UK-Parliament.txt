Sri Lanka is shocked by the terrorist attack at the British Parliament yesterday, resulting in death and injury, the Foreign Affairs Ministry said.

This attack at the heart of London, at Westminster, which is home to the oldest Parliament in the world that has nurtured many of the parliamentary traditions cherished by legislatures across the world including ours, deserves our utmost condemnation.

The Government and the people of Sri Lanka stand firmly in support and solidarity with the Government and people of the United Kingdom and extend their heartfelt condolences to the bereaved families. Our thoughts and prayers go out to those injured in the attack.

Sri Lanka condemns terrorism in all its forms and manifestations and reiterates the need for collective action by the international community to combat this scourge.
