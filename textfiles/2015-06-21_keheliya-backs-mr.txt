Parliamentarian Keheliya Rambukwella today pledged to support former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, no matter which party he would contest from at the coming general elections.
Speaking at a press conference in Kandy Rambukwella said that unlike other politicians rallying around the former president, he would not deceive Rajapaksa.
 “I will be with him throughout and we will win this election,” he said.  
He also criticized the remarks made by Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne about Rajapaksa.
“Rajitha Senaratne is someone who has joined several parties. He would take several supporters of a party and join a new party after creating problems in his party,” Rambukwella said.  
Rambukwella also pledged to defeat the Health Minister in his own constituency.
“I am ready to contest from the same constituency and defeat Rajitha at the election,” he said.(J. A. L Jayasinghe)
