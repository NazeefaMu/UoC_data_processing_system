As Sri Lanka was confronted with a huge political crisis, it should form a Government comprising one party, the United National Party (UNP), Campaign For Free and Fair Elections (CaFFE) Executive Director Keerthi Tennakoon said.

Speaking to the Daily Mirror, he said as the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) did not have the Parliamentary majority, the UNP had the potential to form a new Government and find solutions independently.

“Confrontations can be seen within the Government due to the coalition Government. It was evident from the recent No Confidence Motion (NCM) against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe that it was impossible to run a Unity Government. 

“There are no proper consensuses within the Government. Two parties have incompatible ideas. This can’t go on in this manner. The incumbent Government is not stable. Therefore, we are in a position to say that a Government consisting of one party is necessary to the country,” Tennakoon said.

He said the Unity Government had created the atmosphere for the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) to support the Government.

“The TNA, the official Opposition should act its due role as the Opposition party rather than extending its consent to anything done by the Government,” he added. (Sheain Fernandopulle)
