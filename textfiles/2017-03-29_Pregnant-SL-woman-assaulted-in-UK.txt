Pregnant SL woman assaulted in UK


	

A pregnant woman is fighting for her life after she was seriously hurt in a hit-and-run by thugs as they tried to rob her off licence.

The Sri Lankan woman - who is believed to be four or five months pregnant - had her face run over by raiders as they escaped in a grey Volkswagen Polo.

Police revealed the woman suffered wounds to her head and face as well as internal injuries, and remains in a 'stable but life-threatening' condition at Southend Hospital.

A friend, who did not want to be named, revealed the horror that unfolded in the quiet seaside settlement of Leigh-on-Sea, Essex.

'Three people came into the shop,' the friend said. 'They used a credit card to pay and she pulled it out and called her husband.

'But they took it and ran away, so she chased after them and she fell down in the road and they ran over her face.

'She was on her own at the time and she is four or five months pregnant. It's really sad, she only came over from Sri Lanka a year ago.'

Locals reacted in shock to the news that the family-run business was targeted.

Tom Triggs, 54, said: 'She has a little boy about two and they are a lovely family. My grandchildren go in there all the time, they are really nice people.'

A barber who works opposite from the shop that was closed today said he was stunned by the raid.

John Lloyd, who own Lloyds Gentlemen's Barbers, said: 'It's scary, round here you wouldn't expect it. I can't get my head around it.'

A 25-year-old man was arrested at an address in London in the early hours of this morning. He remains in custody and a car has also been recovered.

He was arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving, assault, fraud by false representation and failing to stop at the scene of an accident.

Detective Inspector Stuart Truss said: 'The shop was very busy at that time of day and there were also a lot of people in the area who may have seen what happened.

'I would urge anyone who witnessed the incident or has any other information about it to come forward and contact us.' (Daily Mail)
