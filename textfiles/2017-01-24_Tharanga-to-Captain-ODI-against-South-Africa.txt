Tharanga to Captain ODI against South Africa


	

Upul Tharanga has been chosen to Captain Sri Lanka’s five ODI matches against South Africa starting in Port Elizabeth this Saturday, the SLC said today.

It said Tharanga will captain the ODI series in South Africa in the absence of Angelo Mathews who returned home.

Mathews had informed the management of SLC that he may need to take time off to be with his family. A hamstring injury on the 2nd T- 20 on Sunday ruled him out of the match forcing the skipper to make an early exit for the rest of the series.

Both Nuwan Pradeep and Dhanushka Gunathilaka also returned to Sri Lanka on Tuesday owing to their injuries.

Meanwhile, the Selectors have nominated Sandun Weerakkody, Lahiru Madushanka and Chathuranga de Silva to join the squad in South Africa replacing players returned to Sri Lanka.
