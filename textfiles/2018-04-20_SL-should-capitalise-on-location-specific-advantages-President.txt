Sri Lanka should capitalise on the location-specific advantages and position itself as a hub when the economic boom happens in the Asian Region, President Maithripala Sirisena said at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting on Thursday.

He said Sri Lanka was geographically situated in a strategic location where the busy East-West shipping route passes just about ten nautical miles south of the island.

“Every year more than 60,000 ships use this route carrying two-thirds of the world’s oil and half of all container shipments. There were many discussions over making Sri Lanka a maritime hub,” he said.

The President said oceans should benefit our people to assist in alleviating poverty, generate employment and promote equity and sustainable development. This is the way to bring in a stable and sustainable future.

“In this context, we welcome the adoption of the ‘Commonwealth Blue Charter’ in our joint efforts to ensure that the Oceans are a shared responsibility and the common heritage of mankind. Sri Lanka is pleased to have the opportunity to serve as a ‘Blue Charter Champion’. We remain firmly committed to the full implementation of the Paris Agreement and the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda. These are tools to promote sustainable future,” President Sirisena said.
