Hashan Kularatne plays key role in St. John’s success

 
St. John’s College Panadura has booked a berth in the second round of the inter school first eleven cricket tournament conducted by Sri Lanka Schools Cricket Association in the on going cricket season and so far they have participated in ten matches and out of them six were tournament games and the rest are traditional encounters. Out of six tournament matches they have won three on first innings and rest were lost on first innings.
Fourth year player and all-rounder Paththini Gamage Don Kavindu Hashan Kularatne has played a key role in their success. Hashan who opens batting and bowls right arm off spin has so far collected 524 runs with the top score of 124 runs versus P. de S. Kularathne Vidyalaya Ambalangoda and unlucky to miss a well deserved century by two runs against Holy Cross College Kalutara and 70 versus Taxila Central Horana and unbeaten 50 against Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte and finally he top scored versus formidable Rahula College Matara with 89 runs and enabled Johnians to beat them 76 runs on first innings.
In the bowling department he has claimed 30 wickets with the best analysys of 13 for 50 (17/13 and 6/37) against Asoka College, Colombo.
Last year he scored 540 runs with the top score of 80 versus Vidyaloka College Galle and captured 54 wickets with one ten wicket haul.
He commenced his school career at Sri Chandrasekera Vidyalaya Horethuduwa Panadura and did not participate in school cricket but he attended cricket practices at the cricket school at Panadura Sports Club and he came under G. Ranasinghe who is his present cricket coach at St. Johns. Noticing the talents of Hashan he helped him to admit him to St. John's College in the year 2013. Same year he was picked for the under 17 team and collected 220 runs with the highest score of 80 runs against Vidyaloka College Galle.
This paved the way to fit in to the first eleven team in the same year and he played for the Big Match and the one Dayer and he was unbeaten on 58 runs when the game came to a halt with the crowd invading the grounds.
There was no Big Match in 2014 and in the last year's Big Match he claimed four wickets and played for the Limited overs game. He is looking forward to give his best in the big match and the one dayer and he feels Johnians can beat their arch rivals Panadura Royalists as they are going through very lean period in the current cricket season.
