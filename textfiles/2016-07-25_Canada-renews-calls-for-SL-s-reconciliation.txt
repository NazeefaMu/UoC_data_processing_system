Canada has renewed its call for Sri Lanka to fulfill its commitments on human rights and democracy, the Hindu reported on Sunday.        

In a statement Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau felt that the war and the devastation it wrought “reminds us to heal the wounds of those who have suffered, and promote unity over division and inclusion over prejudice.”  

He said Canada would continue to encourage the Sri Lankan government to fulfill its commitments as stipulated in the October 2015 resolution adopted by the United Nations Human Rights Council.
