A story that has gone viral in political circles says that three leading lights from the ‘joint opposition’ and a senior government member are to be raised to high office in the yahapalanaya government next week
Three of these four lucky members are said to be facing charges in courts and they have been induced to join government ranks with an assurance to drop legal proceedings against them, they say.
Two of the lucky three from the ‘joint opposition’ are from the South and the other one is from the hills. They are to get deputyships. Incidentally, one of them is a fair one with a daintiness that has visibly wiped out her years. The senior one is from Uva. He is to get ‘state’ status, they say.
 
Meanwhile, a former purohita from the central hills is said to be sending missive after missive to the palace expressing his willingness, but without avail. This worthy had earlier expressed his desire to turn Green again. But the Green leader had put his foot down saying: “Anyone else … but not this one!”
