Life Insurance leader Ceylinco Life has announced the commencement of the distribution across Sri Lanka, of half a million school timetables for the new academic year.
There is more to these timetables, however, than those given out free by stationery shops when the purchase of new school books begins: each of timetable has a coupon that can win its recipient a place at the third ‘Ran Daru Charika’ educational tour of Colombo to be conducted by Ceylinco Life in early 2016.
Filling in the Ran Daru Charika coupon will provide an opportunity for thousands of children to compete for 600 seats -- for 300 children, each accompanied by a parent or guardian -- on this tour of the landmarks of Colombo.
Intended for children aged 4 – 12 years, the 2016 tour will include the ‘Diyatha Uyana’ Water Park at Battaramulla, the Colombo Harbour, BMICH, Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation, the museum and Nelum Pokuna. Meals and refreshments will be provided by Ceylinco Life. 
To participate in the draw for the Ceylinco Life Ran Daru Charika 2016, the coupons on the timetables should be filled in, and returned to the nearest Ceylinco Life branch or sent to the company’s head office. The draw of winners is designed to ensure that every one of Ceylinco Life’s 250 branches will be represented by a child on the tour. 
The cut-off date for sending in completed coupons is 31st January 2016, the company said.  From the children who do not win a seat on the Ran Daru Charika, Ceylinco Life will select another 800 children for attractive consolation prizes. 
Children travelling from distant areas will be provided transport to and from Colombo and where necessary, overnight accommodation will be arranged.
“The response to the first two Ran Daru Charika events we conducted was extremely encouraging,” Ceylinco Life’s Director/Deputy CEO Thushara Ranasinghe said. “It may be hard to imagine, but for some children in distant areas, it was their first tour of Colombo. Besides its educational value, the Charika is a lot of fun, and provides an opportunity for children from many diverse parts of the country to meet and interact with one another.”
The market leader in Sri Lanka’s life insurance sector since 2004, Ceylinco Life has more than a million lives covered by active policies. The company is acknowledged as the benchmark for innovation in the local insurance industry for its work in product research and development, customer service, professional development and corporate social responsibility.
