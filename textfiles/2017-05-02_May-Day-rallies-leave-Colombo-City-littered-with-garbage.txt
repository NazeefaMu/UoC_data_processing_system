The Colombo City was disfigured with heaps of polythene and other garbage in the aftermath of this year’s May Day rallies, the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) said today and added that it took several hours to clean up the City.

CMC Solid Waste Director Yogarani Sylvester said most of the garbage was made up of polythene wrappers and lunch sheets.

“I cannot exactly quantify the amount of garbage collected after the rallies but it was defiantly high. It took CMC workers several hours to clean up the City but they completed the job by Monday night,” she said and added that nearly all the locations at which the major parties had their May Day rallies were heavily littered.

Meanwhile, some of the political parties admitted that the locations they used were badly littered. UNP Young Professionals Association member and MP Harshana Rajakaruna who had joined the CMC workers in cleaning up Campbell Park said the work began at 5.00 pm on Monday and went on till late at night.

A JVP spokesman said it took about two hours to clean up the BRC grounds where it held its May Day rally. “We cleaned the grounds as we usually do and managed to complete the work in two hours,” he said. (Yohan Perera)
