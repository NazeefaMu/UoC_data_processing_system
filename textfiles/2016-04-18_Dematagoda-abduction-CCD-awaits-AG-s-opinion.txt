Colombo additional Magistrate Mohammad Mihar today postponed the inquiry relating to the incident of abducting a 34-year-old man in Dematagoda, where MP Hirunika Premachandra and eight others were found suspects, for August 8 since the Attorney General’s opinion was pending on the matter.

The CCD submitting a further report told Court that it had sent extracts of the investigation to the Attorney General for his consideration.

The Police also informed Court that the report on the CCTV footage, sent to the Colombo Computer School for clarification, had not been received.

On December 21, a 34-year-old man was abducted and assaulted by a group of individuals, who had arrived in a Defender vehicle, which was alleged to have belonged to MP Premachandra.

The suspects were released on bail and the Defender was released to the owner by Court. (Shehan Chamika Silva)
