Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe today rejected claims that he met with former Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran in Singapore.

In response to a question raised by JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake, he told Parliament that he has had no connection with Mahendran after he left for Singapore.

MP Dissanayake asked whether the Prime Minister had met Mr Mahendran in Singapore as reported in media and asked whether he did not have a personal responsibility to bring Mahendran back to Sri Lanka as he was PM’s confidante and the one who recommended him for the Central Bank Governor Post.

"He can personally mediate to bring Mahendran back to Sri Lanka as he was his close confidante without seeking Interpol assistance or repatriation laws," the MP said.

The PM said the Government had taken every step to bring Mahendran back to Sri Lanka and asked the MP to complain if the Government had neglected the investigation.

"We have allowed the Attorney General and the Police to carry out their investigations independently," he said. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)
