SAITM Medical Faculty Parents Forum Convener Gemunu Wijeratne today said that he would file a defamation case against Minister Dilan Perera demanding Rs. 500 million for allegedly making defamatory remarks on him in Badulla recently.

Speaking to Daily Mirror Mr. Wijerathna said that the minister had criticized him in public over the SAITM issue.
“Minister Perera made a serious statement against me addressing a rally in Badulla and tarnished my image,” he said.

He said that he was a reputed businessman in Nugegoda rather than a mere bus owner and the president of the Private Bus Owners’ Association.

“We took a leading role to bring this Unity government into power. I wouldn’t be upset if this statement was made by a Joint opposition member. Even former president Mahinda Rajapaksa didn’t make such statements on me even though I condemned his political activities. Having recently joined the Unity Government, Mr. Perera has no right to accuse me who played a key role in bringing this government into power”. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
