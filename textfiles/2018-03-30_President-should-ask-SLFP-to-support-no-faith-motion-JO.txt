The joint opposition today said President Maithripala Sirisena should ask Sri Lanka Freedom Party’s (SLFP) parliamentarians to support the no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe so that he could be removed from the position without pruning his portfolios.

Joint Opposition member MP Rohitha Abeygunawardena told a news conference that there was no use of pruning the Prime Minister’s portfolios one by one.

“There is no use of cutting down branches of a tree randomly. In order to remove the tree completely, the President should ask SLFP parliamentarians to support the no-confidence motion against the Prime Minister,” he said.

He said government members were now fighting against each other because of this no-confidence motion and added that the SLFP was in an attempt to expel the Prime Minister from his post they had appointed three years ago.

He also said it was better that these SLFP parliamentarians were wise enough to understand the matter even at this juncture.

“At present, a riot has been created in the United National Party (UNP) and the leaders of it are having nightmares because they know the gravity of this no-confidence motion. Earlier, the President saved the Prime Minister despite him being incapable of handling the UNP,” he added. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)
