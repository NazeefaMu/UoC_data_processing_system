While addressing the 32nd Human Rights Council session in Geneva today, United Nations Human Rights High Commissioner Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein said a comprehensive strategy will be required to implement the government’s commitments in the resolution on Sri Lanka.

On his global update on human rights, the High Commissioner commented on human right concerns all over the world including in Sri Lanka as well as the US.

“In Sri Lanka, the government’s efforts to implement its commitments in Resolution 30/1 will require a comprehensive strategy on transitional justice that enables it to pursue different processes in a coordinated, integrated and appropriately sequenced manner. This will require the inclusive and meaningful engagement of all Sri Lankans. I will present an oral update later in the session,” he said.  

In his speech, the High Commissioner said respect for human rights offers countries a path towards greater stability and that his office offers assistance in establishing that path in all humility.

“We shed light on protection gaps in order to help States repair them. I urge you to assist our work, and to avail yourselves of the help we offer. Despite the often terrible trends that I have outlined in this discussion, I firmly believe that it is not yet too late to act,” he said.
