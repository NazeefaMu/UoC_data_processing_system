Kiriella offers five posts for JVP


	

While denying media reports that a Buddhist monk named Ven. Wattappola Rahula Thera was appointed as a consultant to the road development project, Highways and Higher Education Minister Lakshman Kiriella told Parliament yesterday he was even ready to offer five such posts to the JVP which raised the matter.

JVP MP Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa made this allegation during question time of the House the other day.

In response, the Minister said wide media publicity had been given to it, but it was a total falsehood.

"We have not made any such appointment. If you want, we will offer you five slots," he said.

He also denied the allegation that two persons from the same family had been given such appointments on political grounds. (Kelum Bandara and Yohan Perera)
