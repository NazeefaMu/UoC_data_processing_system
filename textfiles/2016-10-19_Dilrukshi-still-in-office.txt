The government has so far not issued an official statement regarding the acceptance of the letter of resignation of Dilrukshi Dias Wickramasinghe, the director general of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption. Consequently she had visited the commission's office yesterday and continued with her official duties.

An officer of a state institution who submits a letter of resignation is considered as holding his or her post until the letter is accepted by the authorities concerned. A discussion was also held yesterday with regard to the future activities of the commission.

Dilrukshi Wickramasinghe had handed her letter of resignation to the President on Monday. (Sujith Hewa Julige)
