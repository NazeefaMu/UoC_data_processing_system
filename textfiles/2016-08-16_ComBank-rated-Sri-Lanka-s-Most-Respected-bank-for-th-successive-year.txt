Commercial Bank of Ceylon has been rated the most respected bank in Sri Lanka for the 12th year running and the second ‘Most Respected’ corporate entity in the country overall for the sixth successive year in the 2016 LMD rankings of the Most Respected Entities in Sri Lanka. The bank has retained its No 1 ranking in Sri Lanka for ‘honesty’ for the fourth consecutive year and has been rated No 1 overall for financial performance for two consecutive years. The just-released ranking also has Commercial Bank within the top five entities in six of the 10 areas evaluated for 
this prestigious list.
Commercial Bank remains the only bank among the top five Most Respected entities in Sri Lanka in 2016.
Commercial Bank has been the Most Respected Bank in LMD’s annual ranking since the publication launched the ranking in 2005. The latest edition of the LMD ranking of Sri Lanka’s most respected companies includes the largest and most diversified conglomerates in the country and some of the world’s best-known multinational companies (MNCs). “We are justifiably proud to be the highest-ranked bank in this list of the who’s who of corporate Sri Lanka and are especially pleased to once again top the ranking for honesty as well as financial performance,” Commercial Bank Managing Director/CEO Jegan Durairatnam said. “It is also noteworthy that the bank is ranked among the best in vision, dynamism, quality consciousness and innovation, because these are aspects that are particularly important in banking.” Using the Olympic Ranking System it adopted last year to record peer perceptions of corporate admiration, this year’s LMD ranking has conferred 79 Gold, 70 Silver and 49 Bronze medals to Commercial Bank. The ranking is based on the opinions of respondents including senior executives from the state and private sectors and their views are obtained under 10 areas of evaluation: financial performance, quality consciousness, management profile, honesty, innovation, dynamism, corporate culture, corporate social responsibility (CSR), vision and 
nation-mindedness.
