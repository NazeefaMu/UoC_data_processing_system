Now that the festive season is round the corner, a top team member in yahapalanaya has taken the initiative to build the world’s tallest Christmas Tree. 

 


A large gang of workers are busy making the Tree on the Galle Face Green these days. Although it has been announced that the project would not involve the use of public funds, reliable sources say that both human and material resources of the Ministry are being utilized in covert ways. 


Employees at the Colombo port, they say, openly express their surprise and displeasure at the X-mas Tree project saying that the Ministry high-ups have undertaken an ‘unnecessary decorative exercise’ when they should concentrate on turning the Ministry’s loss-making establishments into profit-making ones.
