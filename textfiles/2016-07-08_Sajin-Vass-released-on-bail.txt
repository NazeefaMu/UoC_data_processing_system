Former UPFA parliamentarian Sajin Vass Gunawardena, who was remanded on money laundering charges was today released on bail by Colombo Chief Magistrate Gihan Pilapitiya.

He was released on a cash bail of Rs.500,000 with four sureties of Rs.5 million each.

The Magistrate imposed a travel ban and ordered him to report to Chief Magistrate's Court Registrar every Friday.

He was remanded on charges of intimidating businessman Krishna Selvanadan and forcibly obtaining money from him.

The complaint was made to the CID in 2015 by JVP member Wasantha Samarasinghe alleging that the suspect had violated the Money Laundering Act.

The CID said it had recorded statements from the suspect and his accountant on July 7 was balking at being questioned.

The Magistrate directed the CID to take action against the accountant if he was concealing evidence in support of the suspect.

Counsel Anuja Premaratne, appearing for the suspect told court that the CID was maliciously filing allegations against the suspect by misleading the court. He also requested his client to be released on bail because the prosecution had no evidence to prove that he had interfered with witnesses.The case was postponed for July 29.
