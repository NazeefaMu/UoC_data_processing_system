	AICC general secretary and former Union Minister for State V. Narayanasamy has charged Prime Minister Narendra Modi with indulging in doublespeak in pressing the Sri Lankan government for an international probe into the alleged war crimes and human rights violations during the civil war in 2009.
	Talking to reporters here on Saturday, Mr. Narayanasamy said the erstwhile United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government and the then Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh, had constantly insisted that an international probe should be conducted into the war crimes.
	However, the then Sri Lankan President, Mahinda Rajapaksa, had declined to accept the demand. The current President, Maithripala Sirisena, has also taken a stand against the demand for an international probe triggering strong protests from political parties in Tamil Nadu.
	Mr. Narayanasamy said that Mr. Modi had visited Sri Lanka and signed several pacts.
	However, he failed to persuade the Sri Lankan government for an international inquiry and had ignored the pleas of various political parties in Tamil Nadu.
	Mr. Modi had been indulging in doublespeak and let down the Tamils in the island nation. The Sri Lankan government had also covered up the crux of the report and not taken any action.
	Mr. Narayanasamy also wanted the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government at the Centre to take immediate steps to secure the release of 54 fishermen from Tamil Nadu and Karaikal who were arrested by the Sri Lankan Navy.(The Hindu)
