The perfect secret!

What makes the perfect partner? Study reveals the richer the man or woman, the more emphasis they place on attractiveness
*Study based on two of the largest national studies of mating preferences

*Found people with more ‘desirable’ traits were more selective when dating

*Educated men preferred attractive partners more than educated women

*74% of men think a steady income is important compared to 97% of women
What you consider a perfect match can change based on your gender, wealth and confidence.
Now new research has revealed exactly what different types of people think are ‘desirable’ and ‘essential’ traits when looking for the perfect date.
It found that the richer the person, the more emphasis they place on finding a partner who is attractive.
Based on two of the largest national studies of mating preferences ever conducted, scientists asked nearly 28,000 participants, aged 18 to 75, to answer surveys on their ideal match.
Unsurprisingly, the research found that people with more ‘desirable’ traits could be more selective when it came to who they dated.
But it also revealed interesting results about how mating preferences differed depending on their age, gender, race, income, education, and appearance.
‘We looked at the extent to which attractiveness and resources are ‘desirable’ versus ‘essential’ to men and women when they are looking for a long-term partner,’ said Dr David Frederick, assistant professor of psychology at Chapman University.
‘We’ve known for a long time that men care more about attractiveness in a long-term partner, and women care more about resources.’
The researchers divided traits into two broad categories: necessities and luxuries.
The team found that gender was the biggest factor that influenced what people were looking for in a long-term partner.
While men are more likely to choose pretty and slender woman, both sexes want to be someone who was just as attracted to them.
Ninety two per cent of men said it was desirable or essential that their potential partner was good-looking and 80 per cent said they had to have a slender body.
This compares to 84 per cent of women who are keen on appearance, and 58 per cent who want their partner to be slim.
Seventy four per cent of men think a steady income is important, compared to 97 per cent of women.

The study found that the richer the person, the more emphasis they place on finding an attractive partner. Pictured is billionaire and presidential candidate Donald Trump, with his wife and former model Melania Trump
Meanwhile being rich was important to 47 per cent of men and 69 per cent of women.
There were also gender differences in whether it was ‘very important/a must have’ that their partner made at least as much money as they do, which 24 per cent of men saying it was key, compared to 46 per cent of women.
People who were confident in their own appearance did not have stronger preferences for a partner who is physically attractive to them.
But they did report stronger preferences for partners who are good looking and slender – this was true for both men and women.
Men with higher incomes showed stronger preferences for women with slender bodies, while wealthier women had stronger preferences for men who had a steady income or made lots of money.
Older people – both men and women – had weaker preferences for a partner they find physically attractive, who make as much money as they do, and who has a successful career.
‘We found that gender was by far the strongest predictor of what people want in a long-term mate,’ added Dr Frederick.
‘It was more important than age, income, education, or confidence in appearance.’
