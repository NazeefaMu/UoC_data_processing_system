A group of artistes, alumni of the Sinhala Cultural Institute widely known as Sudarshiya, today held a protest march starting from the Sudarshiya premises towards the Japanese Embassy in Colombo.

The protesters charged that there was an alleged move by the government to sell Sudarshiya to a Non Governmental Organization of Japan named ‘Sasakaawa’.  (Pix by Nisal Baduge)
