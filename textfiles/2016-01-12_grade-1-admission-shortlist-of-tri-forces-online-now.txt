The shortlisted finalists for Grade 1 admission in government schools for 2016 from the Tri-forces and police are now available on www.defence.lk.
In total 11,767 students have been selected for government schools.
The Defence Ministry said seven students from the tri-forces and the Police were admitted to a Grade 1 class earlier but it has been reduced to five this year.
It said the list of the students admitted to Tamil medium schools had not been finalised yet.
A circular was issued by the Education Ministry recently limiting the number of students from 35 to 40 in a class.
