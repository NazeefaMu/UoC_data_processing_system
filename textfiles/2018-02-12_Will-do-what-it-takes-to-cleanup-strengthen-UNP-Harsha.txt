Commenting on the Local Government (LG) election results, UNP Deputy Minister Harsha De Silva today assured that he will do what it takes to cleanup and strengthen the UNP to deliver on their promises.

In a Facebook post, the Deputy Minister thanked everyone in Kotte and across the country who voted for the UNP understanding that they are trying to deliver under difficult circumstances.

“To them, let me me assure you that I will do what it takes to cleanup and strengthen the UNP to deliver on our promises. I realize we have to rebuild people’s trust in us. I will commit myself to doing so in the coming years at the national level and guide my Municipal Council members to do so at the local council level,” he said.

He said that they have not been able to live up to the expectations of the large numbers who voted for them at the 2015 elections.

“It was our failure and we must accept the reality. I will do my utmost to deliver on the promises,” he said.

He said, personally, he has always shunned all types of corruption and engaged in ethical behavior.

“I understand that sometimes various accusations are made due to party affiliation or association. While it hurts I deal with them according to my own faith and live my life the right way and try my best to do good,” he said.

Meanwhile, the Deputy Minister congratulated the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna team led by Madhura Vithanage.

“It is, as we all know by now, a reflection of the sentiment expressed pretty much across the island. I realize this vote is not against the candidates I put forward for the Council but against our party and the government in general. At the Kotte Municipal Council level I will be committed to ensure that I help create a clean, transparent Council that would be accountable to the people of Kotte,” he said,” he said.
