The Joint Naval Exercise SLINEX, organised by the Sri Lanka Navy and the Indian Navy was commenced today in the seas off Trincomalee.
Six naval ships and six Fast Attack Craft of Sri Lanka Navy along with three ships of Indian Navy are taking part in this year’s joint training which will be concluded on November 1.
The Sri Lanka Navy said in a statement that this exercise paves the way for operational effectiveness through common understanding of neighbouring navies.
“The joint exercise concerns on maintaining effective maritime security in the region by integrating forces through cooperation, coordination and collaboration. This leads to mutual understanding of limitations and capabilities, to enhance service interoperability and system compatibility in countering challenges,” the Navy said.
It said that it was a great opportunity for both the Navies to rehearse and improve capabilities such as cross deck operations, replenishment at sea and information sharing. The marines will also carry out coordinated helicopter operations at sea during the exercise.
The Sri Lankan Navy appreciated Indian Navy’s role in the joint naval exercise and said they have been a great mentor of Sri Lanka Navy in many maritime aspects.
“Regular joint exercises have facilitated both the navies to gradually and systematically develop professionalism through these interactions,” the Navy said.
