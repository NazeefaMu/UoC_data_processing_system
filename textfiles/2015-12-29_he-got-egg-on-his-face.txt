He got egg on his face!


	


A powerful purohita in the yahapalanaya gave the Diyawanna backbenchers a pep talk recently.
The talk revolved mainly around the emoluments paid to Diyawanna members. “A counterpart of ours in the Maldives receives a monthly pay of Rs.700,000. In India it is Rs.400,000. How much are we getting a month? Only Rs.56,000. What we get after the dedcuction for meals is a mere pittance. Can we manage with this pay?” The Purohita continued after giving the members a few seconds to mull over the question: “I decided to present a proposal to the government to give our members a better deal – a certain concession in addition to an increase in the pay. A big loan in lieu of the vehicle permit for repayment in small instalments from the increased pay. Another vehicle if need be from the government!”
The backbenchers were highly elated over the bright prospects for them raised by the powerful purohita. And they pledged to support the Budget in one voice.
Later, the purohita informally presented his bright idea at the meeting of the highest decision making body. And the instant reaction to it from those at the highest echelons was volcanic. The highest authority in Yahapalanaya angrily turned on the purohita: “We are now trying our best to quieten the hue and cry caused by the Budget proposals. Meanwhile, you are trying to create new issues for us. Do you want to create a situation where we wouldn’t be able to step out of our homes. Now you had better confine your bright idea to yourself.”
The purohita had meekly sat down.
