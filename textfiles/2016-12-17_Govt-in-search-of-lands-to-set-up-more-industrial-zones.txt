The Government has decided to look for suitable lands for the proposed industrial zones in the Western, Sabaragamuwa and North-Western Provinces and to secure them within three months.

Sources close to Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said at a recent meeting with provincial politicians.

They said the Prime Minister had directed the provincial politicians to select suitable land in Mirigama, Kalutara and the Sabaragamuwa Province for these zones which were to be set up in addition to the industrial zone in Hambantota and the financial city in Colombo.

An industrial zone has been envisaged for Matara as well. (Yohan Perera)
