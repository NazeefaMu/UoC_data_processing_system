Catalans declare independence from Spain


	

The Catalan regional parliament has voted to declare independence from Spain, while the Spanish parliament has approved direct rule over the region, BBC reported last evening.

Catalan MPs had easily approved the move amid an opposition boycott.

Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy had told senators direct rule was needed to return "law, democracy and stability" to Catalonia.

The crisis began earlier this month when Catalonia held a controversial referendum on independence.

The Catalan government said that of the 43% of potential voters who took part, 90% were in favour of independence.

But Spain's Constitutional Court had ruled the vote illegal. A motion declaring independence was approved on Friday with 70 in favour, 10 against, and two abstentions in the 135-seat chamber.

The measure calls for the transfer of legal powers from Spain to an independent Catalonia. But the Spanish Constitutional Court is likely to declare it illegal, while the US, UK, Germany and France all expressed support for Spanish unity.

European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker said the EU "doesn't need any more cracks, more splits".

Catalan President Carles Puigdemont has called for supporters to "maintain the momentum" in a peaceful manner.

Crowds have been celebrating the declaration of independence and Spanish flags have been removed from some regional government buildings in Catalonia.

The pro-independence crowd outside the parliament followed the session vote by vote.  

The crowd met every Yes vote with a cheer - and every No with a boo. At the end, there was a huge cheer.

Soon after the vote at the regional parliament, the Senate - Spain's upper house - made the unprecedented step of approving measures allowing the Spanish government to impose direct rule over Catalonia.

There were 214 votes in favour and 47 against. Urging calm, Prime Minister Rajoy said: "Spain is a serious country, it is a great nation and we are not prepared in any way to allow some people to liquidate our constitution."

He is holding a cabinet meeting to decide what measures to take. It could include the firing of Catalan leaders, and the Spanish government taking control of the region's finances, police and publicly owned media.
