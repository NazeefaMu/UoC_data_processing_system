They fear that son would damage father’s image


	


	A young politico in the family of the deposed strongman was given strict instructions by the Buddhist monks close to the family and the Betel Leaf seniors to keep away from all public activity organized on behalf of his father.

Accordingly, the young man confined himself to the affairs on his home turf. Meanwhile, two former talkative Ministerial ones and a Provincial Chief   brought the controversial son back to the political activity organized to promote the image of his father.
The party seniors have again begun complaining that their own political future is stake unless the son is sent into oblivion again.
