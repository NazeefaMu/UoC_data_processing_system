Ajith Fernando, Managing Director of CAL says, “As the preferred partner in financial markets, CAL is focused on setting new benchmarks to serve customers better. Our focus on harnessing fin-tech solutions has led us to introduce and pioneer several disruptive innovations to traditional finance products in the market. Our main aim is to simplify the act of investing and make it accessible to any and everyone while ensuring convenience, accessibility and efficiency. We believe the common man should benefit from opportunities in the nation’s financial markets and Fipbox is one such instance of a centralized web platform that allows lay investors to view fixed deposits rates from various banks and financial institutions and to select the one that best suits their requirements. We are proud to welcome a financial institution of the caliber of LB Finance onboard Fipbox.”

Elaborating further, Deshan Pushparajah – Director, Fipbox adds, “Fixed deposits are a secure form of investment that offer guaranteed returns at interest rates higher than regular savings accounts, providing a nest egg for investors. However, it is important to shop for the best rates and terms to suit particular needs of each investor, which is why we launched Fipbox. This application makes it simple for public to open fixed deposits in a hassle-free manner by using the Fipbox one-time form filling and start saving. Fipbox has all the rates and options in one place to make an informed decision, while investing can then be done in three clicks. This partnership is crucial for investors because LB Finance is a preferred fixed deposit partner for investors, having built an unmatched reputation as one of Sri Lanka’s most trusted financial institutions.
