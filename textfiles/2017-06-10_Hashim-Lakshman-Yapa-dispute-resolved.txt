Fisheries Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said yesterday the dispute between Public Enterprise Development Minister Kabir Hashim and State Minister Lakshman Yapa Abeywardane over office space had been resolved.

He said Minister Abeywardane would be able to assume duties next week and that the President would Gazette the institutions coming under the purview of the recently sworn-in ministers by next week.

Minister Amaraweera said the subjects would not be assigned to the ministers and state ministers on an ad hoc basis.

“I believe it will be done on a scientific basis,” he said. (Kelum Bandara)
