An Indian man murdered a Sri Lankan nurse in Kuwait following a rift over a KD500 (Dh7,000) debt, a newspaper in the oil-rich Gulf emirate reported on Monday.
The unnamed man waited for the 31-year-old nurse to step out of the hospital in the capital Kuwait City and stabbed her twice in the back, 'Al Watan' said.
An Arab hospital employee who was entering the hospital rushed to the scene and caught the killer, the paper said, adding that he was handed to the police.
“The killer told the police he stabbed the woman after she refused to pay him a debt of KD500,” the paper said. (Emirates 24/7)
