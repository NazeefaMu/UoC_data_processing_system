Getting ready for the pole vault?


	

The hero of this story was a popular purohita of the previous regime and a loyalist of the former strongman to boot.  This one was not fortunate enough to get a portfolio in yahapalanaya like some of his close associates. On his visits to Diyawanna he was invariably seen in the company of his pals of the ‘joint opposition’. 
Nevertheless, he would on the sly call on a high Diyawanna official known to be a close friend of a prominent government politician and spend hours chatting and joking with him. 
Those who have closely observed the movements of our hero say that he would make it a point to meet the official on the second floor without leaving the slightest room for his ‘joint opposition’ pals to learn about his close relationship with the official.
