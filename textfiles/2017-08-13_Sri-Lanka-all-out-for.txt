Sri Lanka all out for 135


	

India dismissed Sri Lanka for 135 runs and enforced the follow on, with Kuldeep Yadav taking 4 wickets, Indian media reported. Earlier, Hardik Pandya scored a century to power India to 487.

The slight glimmer of hope that the Lankans had after winning two sessions over India on day one meant nothing on day two as Sri Lanka failed to curtail the Indian tail.

Pandya exhibited excellent temperament to negotiate the first hour of play sensibly combining for a 62-run stand for the eighth wicket with Kuldeep Yadav (26), before he switched to his beast mode taking 58 runs in just 32 deliveries batting with number 11 batsman, Umesh Yadav en route to his maiden first-class triple-figure mark with the help of eight fours and seven sixes.

With the first innings score stretched to 487, it was time for the Indian bowlers to take centerstage.

Mohammad Shami claimed two up front before chinaman bowler Kuldeep got in to the act with 4 for 40. Shami was on point right from the start, finding his line and length and hint of away movement from angle made life tough for both SL openers Upul Tharanga and Dimuth Karunaratne.
