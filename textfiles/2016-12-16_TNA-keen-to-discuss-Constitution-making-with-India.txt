The Tamil National Alliance (TNA) said yesterday it was of the view that there was a need to discuss Sri Lanka's constitution-making process with the international community, especially with India.

TNA Deputy Leader Mavai Senathirajah, who is also the leader of the Ilankai Tamil Arachi Katchchi (ITAK) said no such discussions had been scheduled so far.

He said his party was keen on a federal solution to the national question.

“Even in my latest speech in parliament I stressed the need to devolve even financial matters to the North,” he said. (Kelum Bandara)
