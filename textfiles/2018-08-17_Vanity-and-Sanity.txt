A prominent politico had got quite concerned when he heard that a family member of his, a chief of a mini-council had gone on a spree of implementing a series of unpopular measures such as dismantling unauthorized structures and forcibly removing pavement vendors, hurting several sections of the local folk.

 


Following numerous complaints from affected party supporters, the politico had advised the family member not to rush into doing things that hurt their loyal supporters.


However, the mini-council head had turned angrily on him and retorted: “You better mind your own business. Though you have been riding high you have not done anything for my sake so far. Now that I have got some power and authority with my own efforts, I will do things as I please. I don’t care for anybody’s advice!”
