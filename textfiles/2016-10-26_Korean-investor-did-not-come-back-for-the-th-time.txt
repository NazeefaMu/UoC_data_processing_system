Disposal of the city garbage has now reached national crisis proportions.


While the residents of Meetotamulla are demanding that the garbage heap there be removed without further delay, people in Ja-ela area are up in arms against a reported move to dump the city garbage on an already identified site there.


Amid these agitations, a leading Korean entrepreneur who visited this country looking for an investment opportunity, made preparations with a local business partner to launch a multi-purpose garbage re-cycling project which included a bio-gas-fired power plant. 


Later, the Korean investor who had to go through a miles-long procedure to obtain official approval for the project had failed to receive the necessary co-operation from some of the state agencies involved. Finally, he had met the country’s highest political authority along with the local partner and placed their case before him. 


The highest authority who gave an attentive ear to them, immediately summoned all political and white collar authorities involved with the subject for a discussion and instructed them to extend their support to the foreign investor and his local partner.


The Korean investor took advantage of this meeting to explain the hardship he had to undergo in trying to get his project off the ground. He told the country’s highest authority that he was visiting the country for the 44th time in connection with the proposed project and hoped that he would get the assistance from all authorities concerned to get his project going without any further undue delay.   
The highest authority who listened to the travails that the foreigner had to undergo ordered all political and white collar big guns not to disappoint the investor this time round. 


The Korean investor and his local partner inspired by the encouraging words of the country’s highest authority went round with renewed vigor to clear the hurdles in their way. But alas! They discovered after two months of going from pillar to post they were still at square one.  Following discreet inquiries made about the failure on the part of the authorities to expedite procedural formalities, they learnt that a top team member in yahapalanaya handling affairs related to international trade had upset the apple cart. 


A highly dejected Korean investor finally left the country having decided not or return here for the 45th time.
By the way, the Korean entrepreneur is said to be now in Bangladesh busy ploughing his monies into some projects launched in that country.
