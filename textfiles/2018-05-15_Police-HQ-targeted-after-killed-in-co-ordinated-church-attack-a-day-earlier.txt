The police headquarters in Indonesia’s second largest city was attacked Monday by suspected militants who detonated explosives on a motorcycle.   


CCTV footage shows a car and two motorcycles approaching a security checkpoint at the police complex. Then explosives from one of the motorbikes with at least two people aboard it detonates.   
Surabaya police spokesman Frans Barung Mangera said civilians and police were victims of the attack but did not immediately announce a death or injury toll.  


The attack came a day after members of one family killed at least eight people in suicide bombings at three churches in Surabaya.  


Police say the family that carried out Sunday’s suicide bombings had returned to Indonesia from Syria and included girls aged nine and 12. All six members of the family died.   A witness described the woman’s attack at the Diponegoro church, saying she was carrying two bags when she arrived.  


‘At first officers blocked them in front of the churchyard, but the woman ignored them and forced her way inside. Suddenly she hugged a civilian then (the bomb) exploded,’ said the witness, a security guard who identified himself as Antonius.   


Separately on Sunday, three members of another family were killed when homemade bombs exploded at an apartment in Sidoarjo, a town bordering Surabaya, according to the police.  
Indonesia’s president condemned Sunday’s attacks as ‘barbaric.’  


ISIS claimed responsibility for the church attacks in a statement carried by its Aamaq news agency.
