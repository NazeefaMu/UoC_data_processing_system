Lawyer and environmental protection activist Jagath Gunawardena said the killing of the leopard by villagers at Ambalakulam in Kilinochchi was a non-bailable offence under the Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance.

He told Daily Mirror under Section 30 (2) of the Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance the killing or harming such an animal would be a punishable offence and liable for imprisonment and fine on the discretion of the Court.

“As provided by Section 67B of the Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance, this kind of incident can be considered an offence where an arrest can be made without a warrant,” he said. “Such an incident has happened in Sri Lanka for the first time. However, these kinds of incidents are common in some foreign countries. It is a non-bailable offence."

Meanwhile, the four suspects arrested on charges of killing the leopard were remanded by the Kilinochchi Magistrate’s Court recently. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)
