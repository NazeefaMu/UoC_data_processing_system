Makeup Artist gives Disney Princesses a Gory Makeover

This exercise in makeup and imagination highlights domestic violence, societial expectations of women and beauty standards. Reflections on those important issues are reflected in the updated article.
Makeup artist Shonagh Scott re-imagined Disney princesses as the victims of their own tales, and we seriously can't get enough. Is it too late to change our Halloween costume?
In what Scott calls her "Happily Never After" series, Ariel, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, Elsa and Snow White each meet their demise in a most awesomely gruesome fashion.
First up is Ariel. Looks like Ursula finally had enough of the mermaid singing about "whatchamacallit's" and combing her hair with a fork. So, in Scott's vision, the red-headed beauty had her vocal chords removed by her enemy.
Then there is Snow White. The Evil Queen didn't just want to kill her competition, she wanted her face to melt off first. In the detail, you can see the poison from the apple working its way into Snow's veins and chemically burning her face. It's a different ending that puts a harsh light the standards of beauty to which we're all held.
Cinderella is by far our favorite: The heel of her glass slipper is poking out of her cheek. The story Shonagh came up to accompany this image is artful: "Cinders tripped down the stairs, face planted her shoe & impaled her face." It certainly puts a new spin on Cinderella's perfect night with Prince Charming that is not so graceful.
When it comes to Belle, the Beast couldn't keep his temper and lashed out, literally. This look casts Belle as a victim of domestic violence in a frightening role that imagines her life if she had not been able to tame the man who Disney made her consort. Unfortunately it is the more likely to be true ending to a story like hers.
Kudos to Shonagh on both her imagination and talent. Recasting these perfect princesses as fallible women who succumb to the darker aspects of their fairy tales is a captivating, brave and clearly gory exercise.
It takes them off their pedestals and recasts them as the mere mortals that most of us women are. We are both officially creeped out and mesmerized at the same time.
