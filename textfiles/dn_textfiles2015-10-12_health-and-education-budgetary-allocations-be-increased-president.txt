Health and education budgetary allocations to be increased - President

President Maithripala Sirisena says he would take action to further increase the allocation of funds for free health and free education in the country, in next year's budget.
"The government has already allocated a higher amount of funds for free health and free education. The government will give priority to providing a better health service and better education,"the President said.
The President was speaking at the opening ceremony of the new building complex of the Negombo General Hospital yesterday.
