National Freedom Front Spokesman Mohammed Muzammil was further remanded till July 27 by the Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne over the inquiry conducted against him for allegedly misappropriating Rs. 6.1 million public funds.

He is alleged to have committed the fraud by misusing a vehicle belonging to the Presidential Secretariat during the years 2009-2014.

The Magistrate today rejected the two requests made by the Defense lawyers who submitted in a written bail application questioning the arrest made by the police.

They submitted that the arrest was made without proper evidence over the suspect and further submitted that the suspect's child is suffering from an ailment which was cited as a special circumstance in granting bail.

The FCID filed charges under section 5(1), ‘Dishonest Misappropriation, Criminal Breach of Trust, Cheating, Forgery and Falsification of Accounts’ of the Public Property Act and the Section 3, that ‘Any transaction derived from illegal activity’, of the Money Laundering Act.
