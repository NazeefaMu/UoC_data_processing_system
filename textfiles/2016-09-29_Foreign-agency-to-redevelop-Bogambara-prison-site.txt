The Cabinet yesterday approved a proposal by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to assign an international agency to redevelop the Bogambara Prison site as a tourist attraction while preserving its historical value.

It was reported that the selected agency which would redevelop the site would be a reputed agency with experience in carrying out such projects.

“The Prime Minister proposed that the five-hectare block of land in the heart of the Kandy City be redeveloped. It fell vacant after the Bogambara Prisons complex was shifted to Pallekele,” the Cabinet proposal said.
