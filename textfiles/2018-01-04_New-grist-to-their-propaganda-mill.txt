There is a deputy purohita well-known as the political power behind the issuance of many permits for mining and transporting sand. Of course, the politico is keeping himself out of the scene as he has a family member as the front man for directly dealing with the permit seekers. 

 


With local polls in the offing, the politico has become more liberal in obliging the permit seekers. Political activists, particularly hawk-eyed these days have got wise to the secret role being played by the deputy and the Green and ‘Red’ heavyweights are said to be now getting ready to expose the racket with a big bang, they say.
