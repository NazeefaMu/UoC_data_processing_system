Trishaw with 13 schoolchildren aboard comes to grief in Elpitiya


	

Thirteen schoolchildren and a three-wheeler driver sustained serious injuries when a trishaw bringing children back home after school crashed into the rear of a moving tipper-truck on the Awiththawa Road in the Walahena area in Elpitiya last afternoon. The condition of nine students was reported to be critical.

Police investigations revealed that two students who were scheduled to travel in this trishaw had dropped out due to a lack of space for them to get in.

Headquarters Inspector of the Elpitiya Police B. L. Ajith Prasanna said that area residents had been alerted by the cries of the wounded students emanating from the spot where the accident took place and made arrangements to rush them to the nearest hospital.

He stated that the main reason for such accidents taking place was driver negligence in loading excessive numbers into their vehicles. He also blamed the children's parents for not being more vigilant about the transport arrangements of their children.

A spokesman for the Elpitiya Hospital said that four students as well as the three-wheeler driver were rushed to the Karapitiya Teaching Hospital as their condition was said to be critical.

The students, aged between 7 and 14, were residents of Katapala, Ganegoda and Awiththawa and attended Ganegoda Maha Vidyalaya as well as several other schools in the Elpitiya area, police said. (Janath de Silva)
