DFCC Bank is proud to be the ‘Official Banking Partner’ for the Shape South Asia 2016 event, to be held in Colombo from 22nd to 25th September.  Held under the theme of ‘Shaping Identities’, the event will be hosted by the Global Shapers Colombo Hub, who won the bid to host this event in Sri Lanka. Global Shapers will use Colombo and Sri Lanka as a backdrop to explore the role that dynamic and successful millennials would play in shaping their communities to make 
positive change. 


The Global Shapers Community is a worldwide network of hubs developed and led by promising young leaders who want to build on their entrepreneurial achievements to make a positive contribution to their communities. Global Shapers from across South Asia are expected to gather in Colombo for this landmark event. 


CEO of DFCC Bank, Arjun Fernando said, “The entrepreneurial spirit of this global event mirrors DFCC Bank’s mission to drive self-reliance and entrepreneurship in small, medium and large scale businesses, by offering access to finance along with other value added services to enhance competitiveness. As the official banking partner for this globally significant event, DFCC Bank will reach out to the youth segment, offering a wide array of products and services, in particular its latest product – Vardhana 
Virtual Wallet.” With a 60-year-old legacy, DFCC Bank has played a pioneering role in supporting new entrepreneurs, investment ideas and sectors. Over the years, the Bank has evolved swiftly to cater to the financial needs of various generations. In recent years, it has grown its technology footprint by leaps and bounds and is targeting the millennial, tech-savvy generations by launching technology-backed products such as the Virtual Wallet. This product enables customers to pay for goods and services at selected merchant outlets; send and receive funds to and from other wallets or pay utility bills and transfer funds to and from bank accounts through their 
mobile devices. 


The bank’s Digital Banking & Strategy Team is tasked with identifying emerging needs in banking devising products to meet those aspirations. DFCC Bank is delighted to collaborate with an organisation such as the Global Shapers Colombo Hub, as they too are focused on young entrepreneurs and the millennial generation. One of more than 400 Hubs worldwide, the Global Shapers Colombo Hub consists of an exclusive group of 20 exceptional young leaders from Sri Lanka.  This group will learn and grow together through interaction with local community leaders and participation in national and global initiatives, conferences, and gatherings.


DFCC Bank’s focus on creating value and growth opportunities for its customers echoes the objectives that this high profile event hopes 
to achieve.
