MYTH: Popping a pimple will get rid of it faster   

BUSTED: “Normally we don’t encourage people to pop their pimples. If the inflammation is mild, the pimple will heal without any scarring. However if the inflammation is severe, there is a tendency to scar and these will be permanent. Handling a pimple on your own can make things worse. You can introduce infection and by trying to forcefully pop it without letting it heal naturally, the scar can become unpleasant,” explained Dr. Nayani Madarasinghe, Consultant Dermatologist.
