The previous administration was still to answer the question as to why the Presidential Election was called two years prematurely and why no effort was taken to promote reconciliation and inter communal harmony in the post conflict period, President Maithripala Sirisena asked yesterday.

Addressing a panel discussion themed ‘Sri Lanka in Global Affairs: The Journey Since January 2015’ at the BMICH last afternoon, President Sirisena went onto say that his government established after January 8, 2015 inherited a plethora of serious global and domestic issues that should have been addressed by the last government and the consensual government was still struggling to find answers to some of them.

“It is indeed not an easy task to address those issues. Sri Lanka was entangled in a huge web of domestic and international issues. The UN, powerful countries and world leaders were not on good terms with Sri Lanka. What I cannot understand is that when I and my government attempt to take our country out of this mess, the detractors of the government say I was going to betray the country and give opportunities to foreign powers to invade Sri Lanka. I flatly reject those unfounded and fabricated allegation,” President Sirisena stressed.

There were different opinions and different interpretations over Sri Lanka’s foreign policy. But the government could not take advices given by any Tim, Dick or Harry. The government would however follow the most pragmatic and suitable foreign policy that would bring maximum dividends to the country. It was with this policy, the government has won the friendship, acceptance and respect among the global community and top world leaders in the past one and half years, [President Sirisena emphasized.

President Sirisena said his government was not dictated by any foreign power or did not take order from any one. There was no one to pressurize Sri Lanka today. But the international community expects Sri Lanka protect Human Rights, Fundamental Rights, strengthen the rule of law, democracy and the concept of good governance They also want a free media culture in Sri Lanka.(Sandun A Jayasekera)
