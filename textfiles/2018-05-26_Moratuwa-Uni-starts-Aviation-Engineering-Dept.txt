Flying in the sky was a big dream of humans throughout the globe in the past and different nations tried in several ways to achieve the success but failed.  


According to the legend of Ravana Dandumoneraya might be the world’s first aeroplane which transported people, thousands of years before Wright brothers’ invention. Therefore, we had a great history in constructing aeroplanes. With the growing trend of searching of Ravana legend among public research, if we will be able to prove the history, we can claim that we are the pioneers of the aeronautical field.  


A long time after Ravana era, past 2-3 decades, there was an isolated effort of making aeroplanes in Sri Lanka and most of these were confined to research level.  
In addition, there have been few aviation schools dedicated to aircraft maintenance courses. The Aeronautical Engineering is growing in-line with the country’s expanding air transport sector, as well as the increase in industry-related professionals.

Amongst all the courses in engineering, aeronautical engineering is a niche field and is only available in a few reputed 


universities in the world.   As a result of high demand for aeronautical engineering courses, for the first time in the state university sector, the Department of Mechanical Engineering of the University of Moratuwa added “Aviation” to the B.Sc. Engineering degree programme.  Our Aeronautical Engineering Stream provides a solid foundation in mechanical engineering, leading to specialisation in aeronautical engineering. Aeronautical Engineering is a branch of aerospace engineering that deals with the study and creation of advanced technologies in the field of aviation, defence system, 


and space technology.   This course prepares you for designing, development, testing, maintenance and operation of commercial aeroplanes, military aircraft and their components. Although aeronautical engineers generally don’t fly aircraft, they certainly have a huge contribution towards the field of aviation.  


This course not only produced young aeronautical engineers to serve the country but also show their colours internationally gaining pride to the country. At present, the first batch of ten undergraduate students will participate in international aeronautical competitions in the UK showing that their knowledge and skills are hands in hand with other international graduates.

Aeronautical engineering has become a highly paid and prestigious career option. Although the salary of most aeronautical engineers depends on their academic excellence and individual skills, the average beginners’ pay in this field is much higher than in other engineering fields.  


There is a huge need for aeronautical engineers in airlines, aircraft manufacturing units, aero engine production plants and design development programmes for the aviation industry. In fact, there are immense opportunities for those who wish to work abroad.


Moreover, we hope to get the knowledge and practical skills from world-recognized experts in aeronautical industries such as Airbus, Boeing and other aeronautical related industry, with an aim of manufacture aeroplanes within in Sri Lanka in near future. 


Currently, we are in close collaboration with Sri Lankan Air Force, Sri Lankan Airlines and other aeronautical related industries to fulfil above aim. The University of Moratuwa has already established a research centre in Homagama and this centre caters and provides facilities and experts to make true of this.  Other University students, especially who are interested in aeronautical fields, especially post-graduate level, can also join us.  


Manufacturing our own aircraft is no longer a dream. At present Sri Lanka is already in the process of making a simultaneous improvement on the following aspects such as, Development of aviation infrastructure, Airline fleet modernization and expansion, improving local and international aviation affairs and Expanding and improving aviation related functions and activities.
