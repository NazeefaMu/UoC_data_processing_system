Deputy Megapolis and Western Development Minister Lasantha Alagiyawanna who was the Deputy Minister of Construction and Engineering Services in the previous government when Wimal Weerawansa was the subject minister, said today that no one had recorded a statement from him over the alleged misuse of government vehicles.

The FCID arrested MP Wimal Weerawansa over a charge of misusing 40 state vehicles belonging to the State Engineering Corporation and causing a loss of Rs. 90 million to the state. .

The deputy minister told journalists during an event held at the Sapugaskanda Rajamaha Viharaya that he regretted the arrest of Wimal Weerawansa. “Mr. Weerawansa and I worked together as the minister and the deputy minister of Construction and Engineering Services,” he said.

He said he would not comment on the issue because it was sub judice.

He said former minister Dullas Alahapperuma had made a statement in connection with the issue and about him. “I challenge him to prove I had done any wrong,” he said.(Sudath Pubudu Keerthi)
