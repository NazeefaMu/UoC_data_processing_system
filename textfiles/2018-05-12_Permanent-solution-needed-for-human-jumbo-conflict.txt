Urgent changes are needed with immediate effect if the elephant population in Sri Lanka is to survive. While it has shocked the world, we in Sri Lanka look on helplessly. It was the majestic Dalaputtuwa’s killing that went viral and drew world attention, followed by the killing of Missaka and many other nameless elephants. With an indifferent Department of Wildlife Conservation and interfering politicians, nothing happens. There is the presence of political power behind the rampant destruction of a large elephant passage at Pallekandal which is within the Wilpattu National Park. It was repeatedly highlighted in the media that a shrine for St. Anthony is maintained against the law of the country in Pallekandal. This is atrocity and arrogance when other religions abstain from this type of act. Regardless of what faith the leaders belong to, they must abide by the law. Thousands of worshipers at St. Anthony’s shrine are not aware of this situation.

The State must step in and instruct the Director General of Wildlife to pull down the shrine with respect to the saint and close the entry that disturbs wildlife. It should apply to any other existing place of worship that has come up within this premises. Elephants die all the time when they are robbed of their environment that provides them with shelter, food and water. 

 


Why not find alternate land for all these thousands of farmers and people who encroach and open up the area that was originally the homeland of these grazing animals?


 

Power lines are only a temporary measure and dangerous to the lives of both humans and elephants. Maintaining these lines causes a dent in the economy. After watching this drama for many years and the toll taking on the elephant community, I can suggest a permanent solution but there mustn’t be political interference. Why not find alternate land for all these thousands of farmers and people who encroach and open up the area that was originally the homeland of these grazing animals? This is how it was around ten to fifteen years ago until corrupt politicians invaded the placeand started deforestation to help their allies.

Rubber etc.


They can communicate among  themselves and free up some land to preserve wild life. 


In the wake of Wesak and Poson, the President should be focused on this compassionate issue.
