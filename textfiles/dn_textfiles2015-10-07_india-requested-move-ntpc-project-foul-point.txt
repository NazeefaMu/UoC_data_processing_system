India requested to move NTPC project to Foul Point

Sri Lanka has requested India to move the proposed NTPC project from Sampur in Trincomalee to Foul Point area in the same district, which falls on the eastern side of Sri Lanka.
Sri Lanka has reportedly asked India to change the location of a stalled US$500 million power project to be built by NTPC Ltd. This is the second time that Sri Lanka has requested for change of location for the project. The first was in 2007.
Any change in the project's location will require new studies to be conducted at the fresh site, potentially delaying the project by another two to three years, according to a financial newspaper.
The request was made by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe on his maiden overseas visit to India after assuming duties as Prime Minister.
