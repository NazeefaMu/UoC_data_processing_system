Sand barrier


	

A tipper driver who was transporting a tipper load of sand illegally through a by-road in Mawanella had evaded the police by unloading the sand on the middle of the road to prevent the police jeep that was following him from advancing.

The police are dismayed as to why no investigation was carried out against the suspect who had hoodwinked the police and escaped.

The residents of the area had informed the senior police officer of the area about this incident.
The driver who had fled the scene in this manner has not been arrested so far. (J.A. L. Jayasinghe)
