New dress code for pregnant teachers


	

The Education Ministry has introduced a special dress code for expectant teachers from today based on a decision taken by Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam

“Pregnant teachers wore the traditional saree to school even during advanced stages of pregnancy and this will be very uncomfortable and not suitable in such situations,” the minister said.

Doctors had informed the minister about the need to provide a convenient dress code for pregnant teachers and this resulted in the minister directing the relevant authorities to introduce a comfortable dress code during pregnancy.

The inaugural programme countrywide will be held tomorrow under the patronage of the Education Minister.

The Education Ministry said there were 236,000 teachers in Sri Lanka with a majority of them being female and 10,000 teachers apply for maternity leave annually. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)
