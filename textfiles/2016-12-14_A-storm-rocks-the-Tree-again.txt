A storm rocks the ‘Tree’ again!


	



 

The Tree party led by the flamboyant purohita Haq Kim is said to be in the throes of a crisis again.

 


Troubles had flared up again when the party leader, Kim after making a hurried amendment to the party Constitution, informed the Elections Commission that his ambitious rival Ali from the East was removed from the post of general secretary of the Tree party and a ‘Soor’ was appointed in his place. 
However, the strongman Ali ruling the roost in the East had immediately informed the Elections Commission that his purported removal from the post of party secretary is a wrongful act and that he continues as the party secretary de facto and de jure. And the Commission had advised both parties to sort out their dispute internally.


Now that the ball is back in the party, the gulf between the two factions is said to have further widened and the anti-Kim stalwarts from the East are reportedly planning to lay the ground to install a new person from the East as the party leader.  


Meanwhile, Tree party sources claim that the incumbent leader commands the majority support in the party’s supreme body.
