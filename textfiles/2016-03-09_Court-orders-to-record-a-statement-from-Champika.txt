Colombo Additional Magistrate Chandana Kalansooriya today directed the Borella Police to record a statement from Megapolis and Western Province Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka in connection with the Rajagiriya accident which left two youths injured.

The Magistrate issued this directive when a motion filed by the aggrieved party was taken up in the Court today.

Two affidavits were submitted to Court by two eye witnesses of the accident.

Meanwhile, the Magistrate ordered the police to examine the CCTV footage of the accident and arrest the suspects without seeking Court approval.

The police was also directed by the Magistrate to submit the minister’s telephone records and a detailed report on the incident to Court within two weeks. (Shehan Chamika Silva)
