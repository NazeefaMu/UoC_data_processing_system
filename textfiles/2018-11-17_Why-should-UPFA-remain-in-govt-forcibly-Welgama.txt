UPFA Kalutara District Parliamentarian Kumara Welgama said yesterday that it was questionable for the UPFA to remain in the government by force without the support of 113 members of the House.

Speaking to the media yesterday while leaving the Parliament where pandemonium reigned, Welgama said the UPFA must leave the government if it did not have the support of the majority members of the House. “we are used to sit in the Government as well as the Opposition. then why should we stay in the government by force?” he asked.

He said nobody listened to seniors today and what happened today was witnessed by the diplomats who were at the Speaker’s gallery. “all these things will go to the world,” he lamented. He stated that any issue could be resolved through negotiations. “Nobody listens to us, we cannot even approach them. I do not think that a veteran politician like Mahinda Rajapaksa would condone these things” Welgama stated.
