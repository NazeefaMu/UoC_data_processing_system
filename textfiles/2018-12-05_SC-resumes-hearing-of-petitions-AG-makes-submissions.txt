The hearing of the Fundamental Rights (FR) Petitions filed against the dissolution of parliament commenced for the second day today in the Supreme Court a short while ago.

The seven-Judge bench of the Supreme Court commenced hearing of the petitions yesterday.

During today’s hearing, the Attorney General made submissions to the Judge bench.

The Supreme Court on November 13 granted leave to proceed with the fundamental rights petitions which sought a court order nullifying the presidential proclamation dissolving parliament and the petitions were fixed for argument on December 4, 5 and 6.

The Chief Justice nominated a fuller Bench comprising Chief Justice Nalin Perera, Justices Buwaneka Aluwihare, Sisira J. de Abrew, Priyantha Jayawardena, Prasanna S. Jayawardena, Vijith K. Malalgoda and Murdu Fernando of the Supreme Court to hear the fundamental rights petitions following a request made by the government.
