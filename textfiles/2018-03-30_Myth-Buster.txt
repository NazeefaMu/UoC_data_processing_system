MYTH: You must take multivitamins daily .

BUSTED: “ It’s a common misconception that it’s important to take mulivitamins daily. There is data to demonstrate that   synthetic vitamins and minerals may be toxic in the long-run.  Instead of depending on vitamin supplements, it is best to have a healthy diet. A balanced diet can meet the daily requirement of  vitamins,” said Nutrition Specialist, Dr. Damayanthi Perera.
