A small line that tells a lot


	



 

Marriage or Affection line is very small but it tells a lot about our life.The horizontal line under the little finger and above the Heart line on the Mount of Mercury originating from the percussion is called the line of Marriage, Affection or Love. This line is called the line of Union and the line of Attachment as well.

Two or more lines
There can be two or more Marriage lines on a palm. But one line is always more prominent than the others.

Location says whether you will marry
If these lines appear above the Heart line, the subject would definitely marry. If they appear below the Heart line, the subject would not marry.


If there are two or more lines, the most distinct and the longest one should be considered the Marriage line. The other lines signify attachments or strong love affairs before or after marriage.

Platonic love
When there are several `love lines’ in a hand where the Mount of Jupiter is prominent, the attachments of the subject are platonic or devoid of sexual attraction. Hence harmless. 



In relation to Mount lines
The love lines in a hand with a prominent Mount of Saturn indicate that the subject establishes love contacts with women much senior to him in age. If there such lines, when the Mount of Apollo or Sun is very prominent, the subject makes love contacts with much premeditation. A hand with a prominent Mount of Mercury and several love lines indicates the subject has several mistresses and he fleeces them of their wealth.

Pointer to promiscuity
A subject with love lines and a prominent Mount of Moon would be lascivious and would run after beautiful women. If the Mount of Venus is conspicuously elevated and there are love lines, the subject would have sex with several women.

Nexus between heart line and Love line
The Marriage line has an intimate connection with the Heart line. The subject with a love line more or less touching the Heart line would establish love contacts early in life. If the love lines are distant from the Heart line his love contacts would take place late in life or past the prime of youth.


If the love lines are deep and distinct, the love affairs are very deep. If the lines are weak or faint, love contacts would be weak and transient.


Readers also may note the following well established facts relating to the marriage line.

1. Distinct strong marriage line: A happy and comfortable married life.
2. A strong marriage line in both hands: Married life is a great success.
3. A marriage line that bends downwards to touch the Heart line: Spouse would die early.
4. A line that curves upwards: The subject would not marry.
5. A fork at the start of the line at the percussion: A de facto voluntary separation. (It may not be a legal one).
6. A line terminating at the line of Sun: without cutting it: Marriage with a person very rich or famous.
7. Marriage line turning downwards and proceeding to touch the Head line: The subject would kill the spouse.
8. Sign of an island at the beginning of the line: Marriage takes place after much hardship.
9. An oblique line cutting the marriage line: A married life full of difficulties.
10. A cross at the point where the line bends: Wife would die. unexpectedly
11. More than one island on the line: The subject would remain a bachelor
12. Marriage line meeting the Sun line after moving upwards: Wife would attain a very high position.
