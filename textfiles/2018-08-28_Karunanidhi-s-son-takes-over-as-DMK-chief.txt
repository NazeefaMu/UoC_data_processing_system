MK Stalin, son of former Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu late Muthuvel Karunanidhi has been elected as DMK president, a post which has been lying vacant since the demise of M Karunanidhi, at the party’s General Council meeting today.

All along considered the political heir apparent of his father, Stalin was elected unopposed as he was the sole candidate in the fray at the close of nomination Monday evening.

Chants hailing Stalin as "Thalapathy" (Commander) rented the Kalaignar Arangam where the meeting was underway even as the General Council members cheered with loud applause.

Stalin, who has been handling the party since the run-up to the Tamil Nadu Assembly Elections in 2016, was appointed ‘working president’ of the party in 2017.

The 65-year-old leader had filed his nomination papers at Anna Arivalayam, the party headquarters, in Chennai on Sunday.

Following his elevation, Stalin paid tributes to DMK founder CN Annadurai and former Tamil Nadu chief minister Karunanidhi. (Deccan Chronicle)
