[Action Desk] Tug o' war between road maintenance authorities
Public in a ditch

No authority was willing to take responsibility of the death traps in the form of uncovered drains in two of the most densely populated cities, Colombo and Kandy.
Last week, a school girl was killed when she fell into an unprotected drain on her way home from an afternoon class. Walking home, a seemingly uneventful and safe activity, became fatal for the 17-year-old from Nittawela, Kandy on the particular rainy day, owing to the negligence of authorities.
She was not the first one to die this way. In 2007, another young life was lost in a similar manner, when she stepped on an unprotected drain in Colombo 7. But authorities seem to have learnt little over the years. Although road users have raised the issue numerous times, little seemed to be done to prevent further fatal accidents. Complains to authorities fall on deaf ears. They are passing the buck from the RDA to Municipal Councils and to the Water Board.
Many side drains along the main road and by-roads that have not been covered, create a serious threat to the safety of the people.
No authority seemed eager to take action to make amends and prevent further tragedy.
A pit that had been dug at Norris Canal Road, a road with heavy traffic being an access road to both a private hospital and the National Hospital, remains unprotected.
"The hole had been dug for the past four months and we see no improvement," claims a three wheeler driver K. Lakshman.
"We were informed that the construction work had been given to contractors but they work less than two hours per day."
The threat such a situation poses, is high. Apart from the two hospitals, there are three schools in the area as well.
"Vehicles have to move carefully as they might end up falling into the drain," Lakshman said.
He added that there is a huge traffic jam in the morning and evening due to construction work. Apart from vehicles, the road is frequented by a large number of schoolchildren and patients as well as their families. It is terrifying to watch when one of the parties try to give space for the other on the road.
The authorities have been informed, said D. L. Dhasanayake, a van driver providing transport to schoolchildren.
"The All Island School Children Transport Association informed the CMC that the delay in completing the construction work is a threat to people's lives," he said.
But authorities are oblivious to the situation. No action had been taken despite the gravity of the issue.
"It seems that they do not care about the well-being of the public," claims Dhasanayake.
"There is no point in giving reasons for the delay. It is their duty to complete it as soon as possible. It is pathetic to see the irresponsible attitude of authorities towards preventing tragedy. They have used polythene covers around the drain. That will not save a person from falling in to the drain," he said.
The situation is similar at Kinsey Road where another pit had been dug.
"It was dug a few months ago and there is no progress in the construction work," claims F. M. Fahad, a shopkeeper referring to the pit filled with water.
He said residents in the area complained to the CMC but there was no response. There is a double danger for the residents in the area. Even if you avoid falling into the ditch, you face grave danger of being stung by a dengue mosquito bred in the pit. When the police noticed that there is danger of dengue mosquitoes breeding in stagnant water in the pit, they mixed some chemicals into the water, Fahad claims.
"There are three schools in the vicinity and the school service vehicles are parked along this road. Schoolchildren roam around the road and there is fear that they might fall into the pit," he said.
The Drainage Division of Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) was contacted and they claimed that the National Water and Drainage Board (NWDB) is responsible.
"The water board has to complete the shifting of water supply pipeline for them to continue the construction work," CMC Drainage Division M. Saleem Director claimed.However, he assured that the construction of drains in which the depth range from two to three feet - is not very dangerous. "It is rarely that deep drains are constructed such as the one in Kandy," he added.
The Daily News tried to contact the Commissioner of Colombo Municipal Council V.K Anura several times but failed.

The tragic death of a young school girl after falling into a drainage in Kandy, highlighted the gravity of the problem with the blame resting on the RDA for neglecting their duties.
Even after the tragedy, remedies are slow to come.
"Three days after the demise of my daughter, some officers have covered the drain using polythene sheets and hanged a board on it. In a few days, the polythene and the board will be blown away due rain and wind, claimed M. Shahabdeen, the father of the girl who faced the tragic death by falling into the unprotected drain.
The victim, Azra Shahabdeen, was a resident of Mosque Road in Katugastota.
"Why cannot they find a long term solution?" he asks. A question falling on deaf ears.
He blames the RDA for the death of his daughter.
"Many people suggested that I go before the law but knowing that I can never bring back my daughter, I have no hope. No child should face a traumatic death similar to my daughter in the future."
The police said the the girl, who was accompanied by four of her friends, had fallen into the drain while on her way home. Her body was found 800 metres away, near the elephant bathing spot at Katugastota. This is not an issue confined to Kandy. People from all parts of the country face the same situation, claims Mahendra Wijepala, Kandy District Engineer, Road Development Authority.
He admits that there are a number of drains which still remain uncovered. However, it is not possible to construct them immediately, he said.
"The development project of the RDA to widen the Katugastota Road was given to a private company a month ago. It is also their responsibility to maintain the road," Wijepala added.
Contrary to this attitude, Director, RDA regional office Ahamed Azar, was quick to accept the blame.
"We as the Road Development Authority have to take the responsibility of the accident. Under the development project to widen the Katugastota Road, the construction work of the particular drain has not started yet. The condition of that is the same for the past several years. The total blame cannot be put on the contract company as they have not commenced the construction work," he said.
However, he emphasized that maintaining the drains is the responsibility of the CMC. "There is no need of passing the ball to others. The MC cannot neglect it. Several duties are assigned to them as well.
However, the Kandy Municipal Council is not ready to take the responsibility either. According to them, clearing and maintaining drains is the responsibility of the RDA.
Commissioner, Kandy Municipal Council, Chandana Tennakoon said: "The Municipal Council is not accountable for the repairs of the drains. The CMC is only responsible for clearing the drains. Tennakoon noted that after the death of the young girl, the RDA had been informed to ensure that similar unprotected drains are covered immediately. One week later, this is yet to happen.
The Daily News observed several unprotected drains which pose a danger to trap to pedestrians in Kandy. We would like to bring the Kandy- Katugastota main road, William Gopallawa Mawatha (from Kandy to Peradeniya), Sirimavo Bandaranaike Mawatha and the by-road from Girls' High School to Good Shed to the attention of the authorities to take immediate action to prevent similar tragedies.
