Improve public transport or face consequences - experts warn
Vehicle registrations on the overdrive

Road traffic in the Colombo city reached unmanageable levels this month. New traffic plans were implemented and abandoned. The Police Traffic Control Unit had been struggling to find a solution, but none seems to have worked. The reason, there are more cars on the road than ever before.
As the private vehicle usage spedup, the cash-strapped transport ministry is crawling behind in search of sustainable solutions.
With EPF and ETF arrears of Rs.11 Billion due to be paid to employees for the past five years, the solutions are slow to come. "It is impossible to provide and improve the quality of the transport system when there are financial issues within the ministry," Ministry Secretary Nihal Somaweera said, defensively.
The collapse of the public transport system push people to opt for alternate options, explains Prof. Amal Kumarage. "It is a theory of demand and need. The prevailing public transport system in Sri Lanka does not even meet the basic needs of the people," he said.
Registration of vehicles in September have reached an all time record of over 15,000 brand new and reconditioned vehicles. This is an increase of over 50 percent from the previous month and over 400 percent, when compared to the same period the previous year.
The numbers have been rising for months and would continue to rise, experts warn.
"In a few years time, we would have to wait in queues for more than two hours just to enter Colombo," warns Dr. Lalithasiri Gunaruwan.
There were 429,556 vehicles registered last year. This year, by end of September, the Department of Motor Traffic had already registered 491,632 vehicles, half of which were motorcycles.
"This is because there was a concessionary scheme for government servants to purchase motorcycles. We saw a rapid increase," explains Commissioner of Motor Traffic Jagath Chandrasiri.
In addition, the low interest rates for vehicle loans and lease options too, have contributed, he claims.
Registration of vehicles with below 1,000 CC engine capacity had also rapidly increased over the last two years. Out of 15,107 vehicles registered last month, almost 90 percent or 12,500, were small cars with less than 1,000 CC engine capacity.
"Tax concessions provided by the last budget was the main contributor for this increase, while the majority, almost 99 percent of the vehicles are financed," Chandrasiri said.
The increase in registered vehicles pose another problem. Many main cities in the country are struggling to acquire adequate parking facilities for the increasing number of vehicles entering city limits each day.
This is especially true in Colombo, explains Prof. Kumarage. "There are no adequate number of parking areas in many parts of Colombo," he said The answer to this problem is to provide high quality public transportation with features of 21st century to overcome these issues, a mantra repeated by many experts for a long period of time.
This is not a new phenomenon, claims Dr. Gunaruwan. Many developed nations have successfully managed to overcome road congestion by developing the public transport system.
"Owning a vehicle is the right of a person and we are unable to use draconian laws to restrict them, but we could improve the public transport system to reduce vehicle usage," he said.
Critical of the current solutions provided by different authorities to address the issue of vehicular traffic on the roads, Prof. Kumarage explained that sustainable results could not be achieved by implementing a one way road system.
"Not every road in Colombo face huge traffic jams and the authorities need to make plans to reduce traffic in those areas and an acceptable and reliable traffic plan has to be implemented."
However, Colombo has no proper transport system, he said. Such a system has to be initiated and maintained to overcome the current problems in the road system. "Solutions cannot be arrived without establishing a standard system in the country," he said, emphasizing the need to approach the problem in a holistic manner. The Transport Ministry currently possess 6,000 CTB buses which they maintain. However, they have no immediate plans to add to the current fleet, Somaweera explained.
The number of CTB buses have not reduced, while the Transport Ministry has managed to maintain the number of 6,000 buses.
"Discussions are in progress to improve the facilities of the CTB buses. The Ministry has already taken measures to improve the infrastructure of bus halts," he explained.
The Ministry of Transport faces several financial problems, claims Somaweera, adding that discussions are on going with the Treasury and other higher officials who are involved in formulating policies to overcome the current problems.
"It is impossible to provide and improve the quality of the transport system when there are financial issues within the ministry. The EPF and ETF of employees for the past five years are being paid, while the ministry has arrears amounting to Rs.11 Billion," he claims.

Improve railways system - Experts say
Improving financial status of the population is increasing is private vehicle ownership. With enhanced financial capability of the people, a private car has become a necessity, explains Dr. Lalithasiri Guneruwan.
"The change of attitude of the public and the increasing trend to lead a luxurious life style means they spend more leisure time outside making it difficult for the public transport system to meet their needs. This pushes them to own a private vehicle."
In Sri Lanka, vehicle ownership increases when the per capita ownership of the people go high.
The trend is common in other countries that have recorded a similar per capita range. "When per capita income further increases, the demand for vehicle ownership will stabilize as they already own vehicles.
The draw backs in the public transport system is also another reason for the people to prefer their own vehicles. Constructing roads is not the solution, he explains. Infact, 'more roads would increase the demand for more vehicles.' Building more roads is an economic cost, Dr. Gunaruwan claimed. Improving the standards of the public transport is the only option and the government should encourage the people to use public transport. The problem is in the high level of vehicle usage, "ownership of a car has no impact," he highlighted.
Improving the railway system of the country is imperative to address the current crisis in transportation, he claims.
"The bias attitude towards the railways department has to be changed. The market for the railways is already established, but it has to be improved, adding that more investment and effort has to be channeled towards improving the railways," he claimed.
Unlike current Sri Lankan policies, many developed countries have implemented strict measures to manage ownership of vehicles, imposing stringent controls on vehicle importation, need of car permits, slapping on high taxes.
"At the same time, they improved the standard of the public transport system," Dr. Gunaruwan elaborated on the types of policy measures to be taken.
