Sons and daughters of the purohitas who have hitched their political wagon to the Maithri star have formed themselves into a youth group, they say.

 


This youth group member is said to be highly upset over the brewing crisis in yahapalanaya that threatens to put asunder the two main partners in the coalition.


They have already decided on a certain change to be made to save the situation and they have conveyed their decision to Number One through their parents, they say.


Meanwhile, the group is said to be canvassing the opinion of eminent public figures on their decision through the e-mail. 


They have also informed Number One the names of two persons to be considered in the event of the change they suggested being implemented.


As regards the two names suggested by the group – one of them is a senior from a leading family now connected to Pohottuwa and the other is an honest senior leader of the Green party, they say.
