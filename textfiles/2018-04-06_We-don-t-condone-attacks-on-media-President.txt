We don't condone attacks on media: President


	

President Maithripala Sirisena said today he did not condone the attack on Sirasa TV on the day of the no-confidence motion.

He told media heads that such incidents including those of harming journalists or media institutions were against the principle of media freedom.

“Be it Sirasa or any other media organization, we as a government upholding media freedom do not condone violence. We experienced how the previous Rajapaksa government led an arson attack on Sirasa,” the President said.

The President was referring to the incident which took place on Wednesday night after the results of the no-confidence motion were announced where a mob had surrounded the Sirisa TV building in Braybrooke Place shouting slogans and lighting fire crackers. Fearing violence, the Sirisa TV management had informed the Police who had arrived at the scene and dispersed the crowd. (Kelum Bandara)
