Appeal Court issues notice on Geetha over dual citizenship issue

The Court of Appeal yesterday issued a notice to Galle District MP Geetha Kumarasinghe to appear in court on October 9.
The order was issued considering a writ petition filed by five voters of the Galle District. The petitioners said that it is against the Constitution and she is not qualified to be a Member of Parliament because she was a dual citizen of Sri Lanka and Switzerland.
The petition has been filed against four members including MP Kumarasinghe and the UPFA General Secretary.
