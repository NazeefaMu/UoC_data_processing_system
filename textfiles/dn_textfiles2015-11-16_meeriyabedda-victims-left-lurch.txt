One year on
MEERIYABEDDA VICTIMS LEFT IN THE LURCH

The over powering stench of sewage engulfs the air around once abandoned tea factory in Mahakanda. Undeterred by the horrible smell, a group of children who skipped school play in front of the building. Four elderly women keep a watchful eye. The sewage pit is spilling over as rainwater fills the pit. The town council truck has to empty the pit. It has done so only twice during this year.
“To prevent the pit from overflowing and soiling the entire area we directed the spillage to the river which flows bellow. We know it is not the best solution, but we have no other option. The pit was built for three months only not to last this long,” Subramaniam Thalaimahal (36) said.
Thalaimahal along with 330 others lived in the line rooms in Meeriyabedda, in Koslanda Estate, which was destroyed in the landslide disaster of October 29 last year killing 37 people. Officials and politicians flocked to the scene, with promises of rapid action to provide the victims with housing, both permanent and temporary.
Foundation stones were laid not once but twice with much fanfare. Temporary ownership documents were also distributed. But the Promised Land still remains an illusion to the victims. Former minister A. Thondaman and Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa laid the first foundation stones in one location in December last year, in the run up to the Presidential elections.
Subramaniam Thalaimahal, returned to the country three days after hearing of the incident only to find all her family members except for her daughter killed in the disaster. 
Another foundation stone was laid at yet another site by two new politicians, in March. The responsibility of handling the project too passed from Urban Development Authority to Disaster Management Ministry.
The pillow passing ensured nothing was done for most part of the year, as the first anniversary of the disaster come to pass. While officers and politicians got their act in order, the victims of Merriyabedda
disaster languish in the shelter which is way past its expiry date. One year later the victims belonging to 75 families are crammed into 50 8’ by 8’ partitioned rooms in the tea factory with some rooms housing two families.
Kandasami Sinnayya (42) is busy making lunch in his temporary ‘home’, while his wife works in the estate. He shares the room allocated to his family with seven other people. They sleep, dress and cook in the same space. “It’s a tight fit at night” he says.
“The three adults sleep on one side of the room, then the five children sleep vertical to the adults. We make a room by piling away all our things together”, he explains. Apart from his wife and two children, his father and three of his sister’s children live with him. His mother died in the disaster. He too was caught in it, but escaped with injuries. He spent a few days in hospital and returned to the camp, where he lives now. As a result of the injuries he sustained he is unable to do much physical labour, the only income generating activity he previously engaged in.
“I never got any compensation, I hear that others have got Rs. 40,000. Apparently my ‘medical’ states that I stayed in hospital for only one day. But I was hospitalised for a few days. It is all in Sinhala so I didn’t know what was written in the medical record given by the doctor,” Sinnayya explains through a cloud of smoke coming from his kerosene cooker.
With no proper ventilation, the rooms fill with smoke when the residents cook in each room. “We had a lot of respiratory issues because of this. In our line rooms we always cooked near a window so the smoke went out of the house. We didn’t breath in the smoke,” claims Thalaimahal who lives alone in the shelter. She lost both her parents and a sister in the disaster. Her daughter who escaped, is now studying in a boarding school in Colombo under a scholarship programme.
Unable to earn a living due to the injuries he sustained 
in the disaster,  Kandasami Sinnayya and his 
father and three children now survive on the 
single income brought home by his wife. 
Designed as a temporary facility for three months, social and psychological issues are slowly rising as over 300 people live together in the overcrowded shelter. Many of the women are affected by the lack of privacy. Most young girls are affected and cry saying boys were watching when they change clothes. They are psychologically affected, a government official helping in the facility who declined to be quoted, said.
Family disputes and domestic fights are on the rise, the officer said. Many children who are exposed to it have started repeating the words exchanged. To Thalaimahal, and many others living in Mahakanda factory a solution seems far away. Although officials have now promised to give them houses, all 75 of them before Thai Pongal festival in January, she has no faith in the promise.
“Only four houses have been completed up to roof level. They have commenced the work for only 50 houses. They are still laying the foundation for the rest of the houses,” she claims. But the victims have nothing else to do but wait.
“We will wait till January,” thalaimahal says quietly. Disaster Management Centre claims that the delays in the construction of the houses were owing to the administrative lapses and shortage of building materials. The change of government also meant a change of location allocated to build houses. “We had two elections since the disaster occurred and the responsibility was passed from ministry to ministry so it took time to get the process going. Then it was difficult to get the money reallocated to our ministry. Now all that is in order, and we have started getting building material, the project will flow smoothly,” Disaster Management Centre Director General Major Gen. L. B. R. Mark (Retd) explained.

However, only 53 houses will be put up in the first phrase. The land allocated for the rest of the houses is being prepared only now. According to Badulla District Secretary Nihal Abeysiri, 47 houses of the 53 have been completed close to roof level.
“It will take time as we cannot blast boulders with dynamite. We will have to use a breaker and do it slowly. This will take time,” explained Abeysiri.

No electricity, no basic facilities:
Long wait for the forgotten of Bandarawela
Ten-year-old Fathima hoped to top the list in Badulla district at this year’s scholarship exam. Her school teachers had high hopes, so did her parents.
Unfortunately it was not to be. Being cooped up in a small makeshift tin hut in the ‘Poonagala Praja Shalawa’ ground for the last one year with no electricity to study in the night, she couldn’t perform her best. Little did she know that the landslide that destroyed her house in Jalashakanda would also take her dreams away.
The landslide in Jalashakanda area destroyed seven houses, including that of Fathima’s. All houses in the area were evacuated and the residents were given temporary shelter in the town mosque, Kovil and the town hall.
After NBRO withdrew the evacuation warning those families whose houses were still standing moved back, others, 34 families in Bandarawela alone had to find alternative accommodation. According to officials in Divisional Secretariat there are close to 150 families who should be relocated immediately due to landslide threats as assessed by National Building and Research Organization.

Many found relatives to live with, some rented houses but like Fathima’s family, there were some who had nowhere to go. The Bandarawela divisional secretariat gave them temporary shelter in the Poonagla Praja Shalawa, where the seven families still remain a year later.
Crammed in an 8’ by 8’ room, they cook, sleep and work in the same space. Two families have got part of the community hall to stay in, while the others have got sheds made of tin sheets. Last week they got permission to build a separate area for a kitchen so they don’t cook in the same room as they sleep in. The ‘houses’ have no access to electricity. So school children living in the facility cannot study at night.
“The children try to finish their homework before leaving school, there is no place to study here,” explains Fathima’s mother, Sameena Begam, 27. Majority of the men engage in daily paid labour work, while the women stay home and make plastic bags.
“We used to make about 300 odd bags a day, as we were able to work in the night, but since we have no electricity we can only sew when there is enough light,” explains Y. S. Farina, another resident in the temporary shelter. On a good day, women make about 150 bags now.
The loss of income is acutely felt by the families as they struggle to make ends meet. Farina lives with her youngest daughter and her husband, in one of the tin sheds. But she prefers let her younger daughter stay with her elder daughter in Walimada as the camp is no place for a young woman
of 18 years, she says. Owing to her failing health, her younger daughter has returned to stay with them. “It’s time to look for proposals for my daughter, but how can we do that here. There is no place to even let a visitor in! I don’t know for how long we will have to live like this,” Farina laments.
Their privacy is constantly invaded. The hall is still used by a number of community associations for meetings every two weeks, at times with close to 100 people in attendance, claims Farina. When such a meeting takes place, Fathima Parshama (29) collects her mattress and other personal belongings and stores them away from where the meeting takes place until the meeting is over.
“I sleep in the area the meetings are held as there is no room in the small area allocated for us. My husband’s mother, husband and the two children sleep there. So I fold up and remove everything when I know there is a meeting happening. The Samurdi meeting has a large number of people coming in. It’s very difficult for us here,” Parshama said explaining her difficulties. Her daughter too sat for scholarship exam this year but failed by one mark.
“She didn’t have a chance to study here,” she says. The families have written to all the local authorities about their plight, but assistance is slow to reach them. They have now pinned their hopes on a provincial councillor who has promised to find a solution soon.
But suitable lands are in short supply in Bandarawela. After much deliberation a suitable land has been identified in one of the tea plantations. Recommendations have been sent to the plantation ministry to get the land released to build houses. The ministry is yet to make an assessment on the matter.
“I was told by the minister that the plantation company gave a letter regarding the land. I have not been officially informed yet,” Badulla District Secretary Nihal Abeysiri said.
Even then, the plantation company has to call for contract to sell the trees. The contractor will have to cut down the trees and transport them out of the site. “All this will take time. Only after that can we start building houses,” Abeysiri said indicating that for Fathima and her community wait will be long.
