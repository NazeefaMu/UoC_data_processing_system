He is like any other


	



 

This one occupying the chair of a State undertaking, a brother-in-law of a onetime high political authority (now said to be separated from the latter’s sister) is said to be a master at making money at public expense! 

 


This crooked political appointee had held a high position in a State institution under the previous regime as well.  At that time, he handled the job of promoting tourist arrivals which gave him a good opportunity to spin money from contracts.


 His current job does not involve awarding contracts (for him to collect commissions.) So he is said to be making frequent foreign visits and claiming huge amounts of money as his expenses, they say.
