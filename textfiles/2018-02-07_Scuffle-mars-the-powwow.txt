Scuffle mars the powwow


	



 

A top level conference of a minority political party with a strong voter base in the East held in a leading hotel in a distant city ended on a discordant note when a heated exchange between two party heavyweights culminated in near-fisticuffs, they say. 

 


The two antagonists were the political head of a province and a Diyawanna member from a district in the East. The scuffle had broken out in the presence of the party leader and the party seniors present had quickly intervened and separated the belligerent duo heading off a serious fight, they say.


However, one party to the incident is set to file a law suit against the other citing a charge relating to a love affair.
