	UPFA MPs G.L. Peiris, Bandula Gunawardane, Dullas Alahapperuma and Udith Lokubandara have lodged a complaint with the International Monetary Fund (IMF)’s representative in Sri Lanka today on the controversial Central Bank bond sale and its incumbent Governor Arjuna Mahendran.
	MP G.L. Peiris after informing the IMF representative at her office situated in the Central Bank, told media that they have already complained to the World Bank and also the Asian Development Bank.
	“The IMF, unlike other institutions, has a special right to know about Arjuna Mahendran because he also functions as an IMF Additional Director.  The Bond sale had detrimental repercussions running for thirty years and the Governor should take responsibility,” he said adding the government was attempting to cover-up the incident.
	Meanwhile, MP Dullas Alahapperuma said they were thankful to the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) for bringing the issue into the limelight. (SD & LSP)
