Former Development Lotteries Board Chairman Sarana Gupta Gunawardena who pleaded guilty for failing to declare his assets and liabilities from 2005 to 2007 was yesterday ordered to pay a fine of Rs.2000 by the Colombo Chief Magistrate’s Court.

Earlier, the Bribery Commission (BC) filed two cases against the suspect under the non declaration of assets Act for two years.

Having scrutinised all the records, Colombo Chief Magistrate Lal Ranasinghe Bandara imposed a fine of Rs. 1000 each on the two cases and directed the suspect to serve a two month jail period if he failed to pay the fine.

Appearing on behalf of the suspect, President’s Counsel Anil Silva informed court the suspect had not committed any previous offences and requested that he be given any kind of punishment according to the Act.

Under Chapter 63, Section 9 of the Declaration of Assets and Liabilities Act 1975, a person who is convicted of an offence under the Act will be liable to a fine not exceeding one thousand rupees or imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year or to both such fine and imprisonment.

Mr. Gunawardena also has nine ongoing cases filed by the Bribery Commission over alleged corruption while serving as DLB chairman. (Yoshitha Perera)
