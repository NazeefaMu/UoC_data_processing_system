Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) Ravindra Wijegunaratne appeared before the Colombo Fort Magistrate’s Court this morning, over his alleged involvement in the case of harbouring a former navy officer Prasad Hettiarachchi alias Navy Sampath.

Earlier, Colombo Fort Magistrate ordered the CID to take necessary action to arrest Admiral Wijegunaratne if there is sufficient evidence to prove that he had aided and abetted Navy Sampath, to evade court where the magisterial inquiry into the disappearance of 11 youths was underway.
