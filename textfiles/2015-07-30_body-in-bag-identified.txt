The woman’s body found in a travelling bag at the Bastian Mawatha private-bus terminal in Pettah on Wednesday, has been identified as that of a 34-year-old woman from Jaffna, police said.
Police said the deceased was Rangan Karthika and she was from Vadukoddai, Jaffna.
Police began investigating the incident after the group of commuters found an abandoned bag near the queue for the Anuradhapura bus and a body was found in it.
Police said they had received information that the deceased had been living in a rented house in Hettiyawatta, Colombo.
The woman had reportedly been having an affair with a man after her husband went abroad. Police are attempting to find out whether this man was responsible for the woman's death.
The magisterial inquiry was carried out by Magistrate Thilina Gamage.
