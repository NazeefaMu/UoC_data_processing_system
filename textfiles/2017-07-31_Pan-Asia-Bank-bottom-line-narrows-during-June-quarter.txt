Pan Asia Bank bottom line narrows 12% during June quarter


	

The mid-sized bank, Pan Asia Banking Corporation PLC, has reported a decline in its profits for the April-June quarter amid higher cost of funds and poor asset quality in a higher 
interest rate environment. 


According to the interim financial accounts filed with the Colombo bourse, the bank, with an asset base of about Rs.130 billion, reported earnings of Rs.2.51 a share or Rs.263.5 million for the quarter under review, down 12 percent year-on-year (YoY).


The financials showed that the core-banking operations had suffered a blow from the higher interest rates as the net interest income edged down by 3.0 percent YoY.


The bank had a net interest income of Rs.1.17 billion for the period as the interest expense rose by as much as 29 percent YoY, while the interest income rose by only 17 percent YoY during the same period. 


The margins came under pressure as the net interest margin fell by 14 basis points to 3.73 percent YoY. 


The most notable was the increase in bad loans as the non-performing loans ratio jumped to 6.26 percent from 4.74 percent in December 2016. The bank has been consistently bringing down its non-performing loan ratio during the last three years but the June quarter marks 
a reversal.  


This could be attributed to the increase in sour loans amid some lackluster growth in the loans and receivables. 


The loans and receivables grew by not more than Rs.1.8 billion during the six months to June 30, 2017, despite Pan Asia Bank’s competitors were seen growing their loans faster. 
The bank had a gross loans and receivables book of Rs.102.9 billion by June 
30, 2017. 


Meanwhile, the deposits grew by Rs.6.6. billion to Rs.98.1 billion, largely from the medium-term deposits as the low-cost deposit portfolio saw its size diminishing further. 


Lower current and savings accounts (CASA) appears to be also an issue for the bank in fighting the higher cost of funds, which has been pinching its margins. 


The bank in March 2017 raised a little over Rs.2.0 billion via a rights issue to stay in line with the Central Bank’s interim minimum capital requirements.


With the rights issue proceeds, the bank is now well compliance with the BASEL III minimum capital rules but fresh capital would be required going forward to fund growth in the medium term. 


Meanwhile, for the six months ended June 30, 2017, the bank reported earnings of Rs.2.96 a share or Rs.616.8 million, up 2.0 percent from a year earlier.
