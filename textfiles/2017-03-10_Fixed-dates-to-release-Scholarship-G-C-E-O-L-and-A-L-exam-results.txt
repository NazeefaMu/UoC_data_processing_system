The Education Ministry had issued fixed dates for the release of Grade Five Scholarship, G.C.E. Ordinary Level and G.C.E Advance Level examination results each year, Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said yesterday.

He said this decision was taken so that the students could have a clear idea about their future education plans.

“Due to the late issuance of exam results, Advanced Level students are not in a position to apply for foreign university programmes,” the minister said. Thus, he had instructed the Examination Commissioner General to issue the results on fixed dates.

Accordingly, the release dates of examination results are as follows; G.C.E. A/L on December 27, G.C.E. O/L on March 28 and Grade Five Scholarship exam on October 5.

Minister Kariyawasam said his attention was drawn to hold the G.C.E. O/L and A/L examinations at the year end in 2019, in a bid to save the students’ time.

He added that the ministry had taken steps to expedite the process. (Chaturanga Pradeep)
