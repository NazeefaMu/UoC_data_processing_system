Showers will develop in the Western, Sabaragamuwa, Northwestern and Central Provinces and in the Galle and Matara Districts during the afternoon or evening as a result of the onset of the Southwest Monsoon and a low pressure belt reported in Arabian Sea.
The Department of Meteorology told Daily Mirror that 10.5 mm of rainfall had been reported in the country accompanied by winds at speeds in excess of 8-10 kmph.
Duty Meteorologist Malith Fernando said due to cloudiness in the South of the country, wind speeds could strengthen upto 70kmph off the coast extending from Puttalam to Hambantota via Colombo and Galle.
During thundershowers, the public is requested to take adequate precautions to minimise damage caused by lightning activity. (Piyumi Fonseka)
