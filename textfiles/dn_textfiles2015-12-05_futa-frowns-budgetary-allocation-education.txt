FUTA frowns at budgetary allocation for education

 
The Federation of University Teachers' Association (FUTA) members said they were disappointed with the allocation of 2.72 GDP on education by the budget as it does not provide balanced solutions to the distressing state of education in the country.
Addressing a press briefing, they said that although the education sector is in dire need of reforms, no provision had been provided in the budget to systematically analyze the problems and to develop a comprehensive policy for the sector.
They pointed out that although allocations have been made towards new degree programmes, little attention had been taken to address the problems of existing programmes of study. FUTA is concerned whether the new programmes will also be plagued with many of the problems that beset existing programmes, such as shortages in infrastructure, teachers and resources.
FUTA believes that viewing education as an industry and a market commodity, as described in the budget, will only harm the education system.
"These are disturbing trends and are an erosion of the principles of free education. This will only threaten the foundation upon which free education is built," FUTA President Dr. Primal Fernando said.
Furthermore, FUTA stated that the budget does not provide an encouraging environment for academics, and this could affect the recruitment of qualified staff to the university system.
Moreover FUTA lodged strong disapproval regarding the removal of vehicle permit granted to members of FUTA.
