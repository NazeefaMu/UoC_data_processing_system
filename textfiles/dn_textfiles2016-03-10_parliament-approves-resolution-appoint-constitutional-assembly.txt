Parliament approves resolution to appoint Constitutional Assembly

 
Parliament unanimously adopted the 'Resolution for the Appointment of the Constitutional Assembly' with amendments yesterday evening. The Resolution was presented to the House by
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe on January 9 to start off with the Constitutional drafting exercise. It was debated in the House for four days on January 12, February 23 and 24 and yesterday.
Leader of the House and Minster Lakshman Kiriella moved the amendments to the Resolution followed by the winding up speech by Prime Minister Wickremesinghe, and the House adopted the Resolution without a vote as nobody called for a division.
The JVP and TNA MPs, and UPFA MPs Douglas Devananda, Lakshman Seneviratne, Chandrasiri Gajadeera and Manusha Nanayakkara were present in the House representing the Opposition, while the other Joint Opposition members were absent at the time of the adoption of the Resolution.
The Prime Minister wrapping up the debate called for a collective effort to bring in a new Constitution suitable to the country and the modern age. He reiterated that the new Constitution would essentially represent the people's aspirations.
The Prime Minister observed if the National Government in power today fails to introduce a new Constitution, there is hardly any chance for it even in the future. "Therefore let us grasp this moment and make a genuine effort.
"The adoption of the resolution is a positive sign in this regard," he said.
He stressed the need to come to an agreement on the electoral reforms soon, adding that if this attempt fails the entire Constitutional making exercise may not succeed.
"Now we have about 50 percent agreement on the electoral reforms. The agreement between the two main parties is insufficient in this regard. What we propose should be agreeable to small parties as well. Their representation in the House should be ensured, but at the same time, we also have to ensure a stable Parliament," he said.
Intervening at this point, Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake queried whether the electoral reforms be presented as part of the new Constitution or as the 20th Amendment. The Premier replied that the electoral reforms would be drafted as part of the new Constitution.
The Prime Minister also expressed the need to further strengthen the fundamental rights of the people and the need to improve the relationship of the central Government with the Provincial Councils.
"The legislative power will lie with the central Government, and there is no need to change it. We will consider the proposals of the Chief Ministers. As at present, the wastage of money is high because the central Government, provincial councils as well as local government bodies attempt to involve in the
affairs of the village. These issues must be discussed," he said.
The Prime Minister said Parliamentary powers and Parliamentary democracy would be further strengthened from the Constitutional reforms.
"The people kept confidence on us and they are watching our work. We must deliver what we promised" he noted.
The Prime Minister, referring to President Maithripala Sirisena's opinion expressed on the Constitutional reforms, said the House should come to a middle position when formulating the Constitution giving up the extreme views in communal lines.
