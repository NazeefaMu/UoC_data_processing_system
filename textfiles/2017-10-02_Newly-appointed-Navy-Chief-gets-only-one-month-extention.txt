The term of office of newly appointed Navy Commander Vice Admiral Travis Sinniah, who turned 55 on September 26, had only been extended by one month by President Maithripala Sirisena, sources said.

Although the President has the power to extend the tenure of the Navy Commander by another year he has only been granted a one month extension which would now expire on October 26.

The sources said it was yet too early to say whether the Navy Commander's term would be extended further after his term expires.

Vice Admiral Sinniah was appointed as the 21st Commander of the Sri Lanka Navy by the President on August 22, 2017.(Darshana Sanjeewa)
