Several civil society organizations including the National Movement for Social Justice (NMSJ) met the President and the Prime Minister today and requested them not to reappoint Central Bank (CB) Governor Arjuna Mahendran until an inquiry was carried out into the CB Bond scam.

NMSJ Convener Saman Ratnapriya said they had also requested to appoint a special court dedicated to hear cases of fraud and corruption, modify the VAT, and introduce Capital Gains Tax and not to disband the FCID.

“The two leaders assured us that the Capital Gains Tax would be introduced and said the other proposals submitted by us would also be considered,” he said.
