Royal Rugby Fiesta on November 22

The Royal College Group of '91 will hold their annual Touch Rugby tournament, 'Royal Rugby Fiesta 2015' for the 14th consecutive year at CR and FC grounds November 22. Kick-off will be at 9.30 am.
The first Royal Rugby Fiesta was organized in 2002 with the prime objective of bringing various groups of past students together in order to promote goodwill and togetherness.
This has been an exciting event for the old boys to get-together and as well as to try their hands at their favorite sport at College. The Royal Rugby Fiesta has become one of the most important rugby events in the event calendar of the Royal College Union from the inception of this tournament.
Matches will start at 9.30 am and will go on until 5.30 pm. Spectators can witness exciting touch rugby throughout the day. An estimated 25 rugby teams and 1,000 spectators are expected for the event.
In the past, this event has been patronized by leading rugby players from Royal College, some of whom later went on to represent various clubs and the country too.
The participants include leading personalities from the corporate world and other distinguished professionals such as doctors, engineers, architects, accountants, academics etc.
Matches will be played under the age categories of 20-30 years (Junior Category - for the Summa Navarathnam Challenge Trophy), 31-40 Years (Mid Category - for the Group of '91 Challenge Trophy) and 41 plus (senior category for the Senior Challenge Trophy).
