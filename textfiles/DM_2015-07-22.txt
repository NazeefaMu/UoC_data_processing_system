A new chapter in the feud between two clans
	
The Dissanayake clan ruled the roost in Kalawewa in Rajarata for a long time. Later this clan was ousted from this key constituency when the Sena family formed close ties with the deposed strongman. The Sena clan held sway over the area since then.
The January 8 regime change saw the onset of a winter of despair for the Sena family with the elder sibling losing his Ministerial status and the younger one his lordship over the province.
Quite recently the Sena family lost Kalawewa as well when the well-known scion of the Dissanayake clan was appointed the chief organizer for this constituency. The young one of the Dissanayake clan was among the few Blue Diyawanna members to have aligned with the Maithri camp ahead of the last big poll and the new Big Boss appointed him as the chief organizer for this coveted constituency as a token of his appreciation of the latters unwavering allegiance to him, they say. However, the Sena brothers are said to be waiting for the opportune moment to hit back at the young Dissanayake clan member.

ADB trims growth forecasts for Asia on slower US, PRC economies
	
		 		 
		 
			
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has cut its 2015 growth forecast for Developing Asia to 6.1 percent from 6.3 percent, amidst slower-than-expected economic activity in the United States (US) and the Peoples Republic of China (PRC), according to a new report.
In a supplement to its Asian Development Outlook (ADO) 2015 published last March, ADB also projected 2016 gross domestic product (GDP) growth for the region to come in at 6.2 percent, down from 6.3 percent forecast previously. ADO is ADBs flagship annual economic publication.
Slower growth in the PRC is likely to have a noticeable effect on the rest of Asia given its size and its close <U+200E>links with other countries in the region through regional and global value chains, said ADB Chief Economist Shang-Jin Wei.
While weaker-than-expected external demand, a declining working age population <U+200E>and rising wages, have contributed to a slower rate of growth in the PRC, reforms aimed at improving labour market flexibility and capital allocation to the most productive firms are needed as they can also help to raise the growth rate.
Ongoing softness in the major industrialized economies (US, Japan, Euro Area) will see a slowdown in East Asia as a whole, with growth now at 6.2 percent in 2015, down from 6.5 percent forecast earlier.
After a slow first half, full-year 2015 growth in the PRC is now estimated at 7.0 percent, down from 7.2 percent previously, and will ease further to 6.8 percent next year. Consumption growth in the country remains robust but investment growth has continued to decelerate. The financial sector is also expected to contribute less to growth after the recent stock market correction, although the drop in stock prices is unlikely to have much impact on consumption, the report said.
In India, growth forecasts remain unchanged at 7.8 percent in fiscal year (FY) 2015 and 8.2 percent in FY2016, supported by a healthy monsoon and new investments. South Asia as a whole is now expected to grow 7.3 percent in 2015, up slightly from 7.2 percent seen earlier, with a better-than-expected economic performance in Bangladesh balancing the earthquake-related slowdown in Nepal. In 2016, growth for the subregion is expected to expand to 7.6 percent.
Southeast Asia will see slower-than-previously forecast growth of 4.6 percent for 2015, weighed down by lower-than-expected first half performances in Indonesia, Singapore and Thailand. In 2016, the subregional economy is projected to expand 5.1 percent, below 5.3 percent estimated earlier.
In Central Asia, lower global commodity prices and the recession in the Russian Federation, have dampened economic performance, with growth in 2015 seen unchanged at 3.5 percent and the forecast revised down to 4.2 percent from 4.5 percent for 2016. Pacific economies, meanwhile, will see a strong year in 2015, with growth of 9.9 percent, supported by Papua New Guineas (PNG) first full year of liquefied natural gas exports. In 2016, growth will fall back to 5.0 percent as the one-off boom from the PNG gas exports eases.
Ongoing softness in fuel prices and subdued food costs are containing inflationary pressures for now, with the projection for 2015 consumer price rises revised down to 2.4 percent from 2.6 percent earlier. Inflation is seen at 3 percent in 2016, unchanged from the previous forecast.
ADB, based in Manila, is dedicated to reducing poverty in Asia and the Pacific through inclusive economic growth, environmentally sustainable growth and regional integration. Established in 1966, it is owned by 67 members  48 from the region. In 2014, ADB assistance totalled US $ 22.9 billion, including cofinancing of US $ 9.2 billion.

Video: White van belongs to LTTE- Joseph Michael
	
	The mystery of the white van with three army personnel on board taken into custody on Tuesday deepened further after a government minister today revealed that it had earlier belonged to the LTTE.
	UNFGG Gampaha District Candidate and Minister Joseph Michael Perera who revealed more details at a news briefing said the white van had been acquired by the Army later.
	He said this incident is an achievement of the people and is a step in the direction of revealing more details of the level of crime that had prevailed in Sri Lanka.
	For the first time three army personnel have been arrested and the white van they were travelling in taken into custody was a victory for peace-loving people and will help uncover the criminal activities carried out in the country, the minister said.
	He claimed that the three army personnel had revealed that the revolver they had with them was owned by former defense secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa.
	Responding to a question asked by the journalists why they were released on bail if their arrest would be a possible lead to other crimes, the minister said it was the courts which granted them bail and not the government.
	The minister who referred to a statement made by some UPFA members that the three army personnel in the white van were on a mission to assassinate ex-president Mahinda Rajapaksa, said those who made this accusation should provide information to the authorities so that a proper investigation could be carried out.

Mirihana incident had no political links: Army
	
The arrest of three Army personnel armed with a weapon while travelling in a white van at Mirihana had no political links and in no way poses a threat to any individual, Military Spokesman Jayanath Jayaweera said today.
The arrest of three soldiers on Monday night resulted in United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) claiming that the incident posed a threat to ex-president Mahinda Rajapaksa who resides in Mirihana.
Brigadier Jayaweera said soldiers taken into custody were members of the security detail assigned to Major General Prasanna Silva and the firearm found in their possession belonged to him.
Major General Silva has been having the firearm for that past 15 years and there have been no reports to suggest it had been used for any illegal activity, he said.
However, Brigadier Jayaweera admitted the number plate of the vehicle had been altered. He said the vehicle belonged to the army but it carried a number plate issued to a civilians vehicle.
We are investigating how the vehicles number plate was changed and to determine if the soldiers were on an official task assigned by Major General Silva. As for the firearm, an officer can hand over his weapon to one of the soldiers in his security detail either when entering the Defence Ministry or at other occasions depending on the circumstances, he said.
Commenting on the reports that the vehicle had been belonged to the LTTE, the Brigadier said he could not comment on the topic at this level. He said action would be taken against the soldiers if found guilty following the pending probe carrying out by the military police. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Detained Lankan close aide of Prabhakaran: Police
	
One of the two Sri Lankan Tamils arrested last night along with communication gadgets and cyanide in the district has been identified as Krishnakumar, a close associate of slain LTTE supremo V Prabhakaran, police said today.
Sleuths from Intelligence Bureau, Tamil Nadu 'Q Branch' Police, and Special Intelligence Unit were now interrogating the LTTE militant, arrested along with two others during a routine vehicle check at Uchipuli in the district, a top police officer told PTI on condition of anonymity.
The arrest of Krishnakumar and seizure of eight mobile phones, four GPS equipment, 75 cyanide capsules and 300 gm of cyanide from the car in which they were travelling is being viewed seriously by Intelligence sleuths.
Police said all coastal districts in the state had been alerted to monitor for movement of members of LTTE and checkposts asked to be extra vigilant.
Police, who also seized Indian and Sri Lankan currencies from him, said they were interrogating Krishnakumar as to when and how he entered the country.
It was suspected he would have arrived in the country in the immediate aftermath of the decimation of LTTE and killing of Prabhakaran by Sri Lankan security forces in 2009, they said.
While local police had last night said five persons, including two Sri Lankan Tamil refugees, were detained, it was clarified today that only three had been arrested.
They were identified as Krishnakumar, Rajendran, also a Sri Lankan national, and Sasikumar, a local who drove the car.
Krishnakumar was planning to go to Sri Lanka by illegal ferry when he was arrested.
Sasikumar, the driver of the car, and Rajendran, an alleged ganja peddler residing in Uchipuli, were arrested for providing shelter to the militant of a banned organisation, police said.
Police said Krishnakumar and Rajendran could be sent to a special camp (for former Tamil militants) after interrogation.
Cyanide capsules, strung by the LTTE cadres around their neck, were used by them to commit suicide in case they were caught by the Sri Lankan forces or in abroad while on any mission at the height of civil war in the island nation. (Indian Express)

Her interviewer was a Blue party stalwart who himself was an attorney.
Before putting the customary questions to the young nomination hopeful facing him with eager anticipation, the gallant party stalwart paid an unusual compliment to her. I am pleased to meet the most beautiful and charming lady to have turned up at this interview so far! Her response was a coquettish smile.
You are sure to attract enough preference votes, the interviewer went on. I think there is no need for you to spend money on posters and other propaganda props!

The JVP has said it would stop the payment of pensions to future MPs. The party has said it would assign only state vehicles for MPs to use in the discharge of their duties and not give them luxury vehicles.
In has also promised to repeal the Prevention of Terrorism Act, enact a Right to Information law and draw up a code of conduct for MPs.

	In an unexpected turn of events former Public Relations Minister Mervyn Silva said he would launch a separate campaign in support of the Ranil Wickremesinghe-led United National Front for Good Governance (UNFGG). 
	He told Daily Mirror that he would never betray the SLFP and pledged his support for President Maithripala Sirisena. 
	The former minister demanded to know from the UPFA why it had refused to nominate him for the general election.
	Most of those who have been given nominations have been summoned by the FCID or the Bribery Commission. I dont have any such charge against me, he said. 
	Mr. Silva said the country would be destroyed economically and the white van culture would return if Mahinda Rajapaksa and his supporters were re-elected to parliament. 
	We have been SLFP supporters for generations. Even though I have many supporters in Kelaniya and countrywide, I was removed from the post of Kelaniya Organizer another appointed in my place, he said. 
	Mr. Silva said even though ex-president Mahinda Rajapaksa and his cohorts have taken over the SLFP, the forthcoming election will ensure the end of their political career. 
	He said he would campaign in Colombo, Kelaniya, Tissamaharama, Hambantota, Matara, Kalutara, Gampaha and in other districts in support of the UNFGG led by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.(Darshana Sanjeewa)

	A video showing an incident that occurred at a UPFA election rally held in Akuressa yesterday attended by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa has started going viral in the internet.
	The incident occurred on Tuesday during a United Peoples Freedom Alliance election rally held at the premise of Akuressa bus terminal.
	Mr. Rajapaksa, who was on his way towards the stage, was seen moving towards a supporter in an irritated manner.
	Security guards pulled Mr. Rajapaksa away to prevent what seemed like a fist attack by him towards the supporter. The former President got on to the stage after the brief encounter.
	Clarifying the incident where the ex-president seemed to be moving toward a supporter angrily, his Spokesman Rohan Weliwita said the particular supporter was under the influence of liquor and Mr. Rajapaksa had only attempted to release himself from the supporters grip.
	Mr. Weliwita said there was no adequate security provided for Mr. Rajapaksa and also some elements were sending drunken men to the rallies of Mr. Rajapaksa to cause obstructions.
	At the Akuressa rally, a drunkard attempted to grasp Mr. Rajapaksas hand. When he grasped both hands, Mr. Rajapaksa freed them from him. Though the former President was provided security personnel, they have not even given other facilities such as mobile phones or vehicles. If adequate security was provided, these incidents would not occur, he said. 
	He urged Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to reveal the models of the vehicles and their numbers if Mr. Rajapaksas security detail had been provided with vehicles as claimed. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

The secretarial one protested, but the new Big Boss waved off his objections.

	Local election watchdog PAFFREL said today the announcement of the government decision to reduce the gas price and prices of rice at the UNP convention, had violated the election laws and was a threat to the conduct of a free and fair election.
	The decision to reduce the price of essential goods at election time is a good step from the point of view of the public. However, announcing it at the Party Conference held on July 11, was violating the fairness of the election, PAFFREL Executive Director Rohana Hettiarachchi said at a press briefing.
	The government had decided to reduce the price of a household gas cylinder by Rs.100 and prices of rice sold in Lak-Sathosa markets.
	Mr. Hettiarachchi went on to say that a total of 6,151 contestants had entered the forthcoming election out of which only 1000 candidates were contesting for victory.
	The Elections Commissioner needs to introduce some guidelines to increase the bond deposit which would prevent the unnecessary contesting.
	He further said the up-coming General Election would go down in history as several special incidents had taken place for the first time in history. Former President, Mahinda Rajapaksa, was contesting the election representing the UPFA from Kurunegala and this was a special feature of this election.
	He said comparing previous elections, the number of Buddhist monks and priests from other religions contesting the election had also increased.
	Speaking about monitoring duties at the election, Mr. Hettiacrachchi said they had taken measures to deploy stationary monitors at 12,314 polling stations and to create the atmosphere required for a free and fair election in those polling stations.
	He said 12 foreign monitors from Asian countries would join PAFFREL. These monitors have worked with internationally acclaimed election monitoring organisations such as ANFREL. he said.
	He said 25 mobile vehicles and another 335 vehicles, each containing 4 expert monitors, would be employed in all local secretariat divisions on the election date. (Darshana Sanjeewa)

Sampath Saviya programme continues to empower MSMEs
	
Micro, small and medium-scale entrepreneurs (MSME) are the growing force of Sri Lankan economy. In the colossal endeavour of developing our economy, it is therefore fundamental to support the growth of these MSMEs. Taking a step in this direction, Sampath Bank, one of Sri Lankas foremost competitors in the banking industry, has launched an unprecedented corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiative known as Sampath Saviya.
Sampath Saviya was launched last year with a focus on empowering MSMEs around the island. The programme was organised in conjunction with Competency-based Economies through Formation of Enterprise (CEFE NET) Sri Lanka and National Entrepreneur Development Authority (NEDA).
They conducted workshops on the importance of entrepreneurial development and business planning, enlightening a large number of participants present from districts across the island covering Matale, Ratnapura, Kegalle, Kandy, Kurunegala, Puttlam, Batticaloa, Matara, Galle, Monaragala, Vavuniya, Kalutara and Jaffna Districts. Sampath Saviya has accomplished an admirable feat of training over 500 entrepreneurs thus far.
Commenting on the Sampath Saviya entrepreneur development programme, Sampath Bank PLC Chief Manager Branch Banking Thusitha Nakandala stated, Entrepreneurship development is an essential component that facilitates the development of any country. Failure to empower SMEs may hinder the growth of social and economic sustainability.
As a socially responsible corporate entity, we fully comprehend the need for uplifting entrepreneurs in a developing economy. It is for this reason that we launched the Sampath Saviya programme exactly one year ago. This programme focuses on development of entrepreneurial competency, planning expertise and managerial knowledge of small and medium-scale entrepreneurs.
Further, Sampath Saviya represents our vision towards entrepreneurship development and thereby distinguishes ourselves from every other conventional entrepreneurial programme out there.
Development officials attached to the National Entrepreneur Development Authority, representing divisional secretariats from across the island, played an instrumental role in the selection process for the recently concluded Sampath Saviya programme.
Amongst this years programme entry criteria was a special criterion stipulating that 50 percent of all participating entrepreneurs be women. Special attention was also paid to differently-able entrepreneurs, entrepreneurs who have received technical training and degree holders in the selection process.
Entrepreneurs linked to the National Apprentice and Industrial Training Authority (NAITA), Sri Lanka Inventors Commission (SLIC) and provincial Chambers of Commerce and Industry were also encouraged to participate in the programme.
The Sampath Saviya programme aims to develop entrepreneurial competency and knowledge via high-calibre training. To maintain the programmes quality and productivity at the highest possible standard, the number of entrepreneurs participating in a workshop was confined to 25 to 30 only.
The programme also placed a keen focus on highlighting the importance of harnessing inborn talents, in addition to competency and knowledge pertaining to step-by-step business planning. As a direct result of our efforts, we believe that after the programme, we played a crucial part in helping shape a community of confident and knowledgeable entrepreneurs, an official said on the training methodology implemented at the Sampath Saviya entrepreneurship
development programme.
Sampath Saviya is an entrepreneurship development programme that employs a globally accepted CEFE training module - already in place in 140 countries - for the training of entrepreneurs. This year, the Sampath Saviya programme will be carried out islandwide from the period between May 2015 and May 2016, centring 223 Sampath Bank branches. If you are interested in participating in this programme, you are requested to visit the nearest Sampath Bank Branch Manager to receive all relevant information.
As a responsible corporate citizen committed towards achieving their primary objective of uplifting and accelerating the growth of our nation, Sampath Bank has firmly pledged to remain focused on uplifting and inspiring the entrepreneurs of the nation, as well as paving a collaborative path to enterprise success today, tomorrow and into the future.

Some UPFA Ministers to resign soon
	
	The cabinet ministers, state ministers and deputy ministers loyal to ex-president Mahinda Rajapaksa are expected to submit their resignation to President Maithripala Sirisena soon, a Minister said today.
	Fisheries Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said several ministers from the UPFA have requested General Secretary Susil Premajayantha to convene a central committee meeting to take a final decision on whether they should remain in the UNP-led government.
	I have decided to give up my portfolio but I cannot send my letter of resignation to the President without the sanction of the party because the decision to accept ministerial portfolios were taken by the UPFA central committee. Therefore, the resignation also must be approved by the CC, the minster said and added that the CC was scheduled to meet in the next few to decide on this matter.
	He expressed his displeasure and disappointment over the much publicized statement made by President Sirisena to the media last week and added it was a set back to the UPFA election campaign.
	He told the media that he had decided against his much hyped retirement from politics because if he did so it would be an advantage to the UNP in the Hambantota District.
	Minister Reginald Cooray said he would also resign when the UPFA CC approves it.
	He said several UPFA ministers were not satisfied with the performance of the government.
	Meanwhile, Power and Energy Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said the National Government formed after the presidential election would introduce the 19th and 20th Amendments to the Constitution and carry out the balance work as set out in the100-day programme. He said the government had fulfilled many of the pledges given to the people despite the leg-pulling tactics by the UPFA.
	However, we will form a strong government after the August 17 elections and fulfill the promises we were not able to do in the six months period of the minority government, the minister said.
	It is learnt that Ministers Duminda Dissanayaka, S.B. Dissanayaka, Dr. Sarath Amunugama, Vijith Wijayamuni Soyza and A.H.M. Fowzie will remain in the cabinet.
	Those expected to resign are Ministers Mahinda Amaraweera, Reginald Cooray, Piyasena Gamage, Janaka Bandara Tennakone, Felix Perera and Lakshmana Yapa Abeywardabna. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

Three-day vigil to prevent rival from getting nomination!
	
This former Ministerial one representing an area in the Colombo district well-known for skilled carpenters has also made a name in a field of performing arts. This time round he is seeking his way to Diyawanna through the National List. But he secured nomination for a family member to contest from the Colombo district.
Despite having no legitimate business, this politico was seen whiling away his time seated close to the Nomination Board for three days in a row until the Colombo district list was fully wrapped up.
The inquisitive ones found that there was no need for him to follow the selection process because the party hierarchy had already approved his family members nomination. They finally discovered the reason for his going through the agony of killing time for three days in a row where the Nomination Board held sittings; to make sure that a certain mayor from his area would not get nomination because he could be a threat to his family members chances of getting elected!
However, the politicos three-day vigil and his entreaties to the Nomination Board members were not in vain for the mayor in question, incidentally a nominee of the Betel leaf rebel group was among the rejects.

Won't arrest politicians till elections over- FCID
	
	The Police Financial Crimes Investigation Division will not arrest any person who is suspected to have committed grave financial crimes, if he is contesting the forthcoming general elections,until the elections of August 17 are over, as such arrests may prejudice the voters against them or their parties, a senior officer said.
	The special police unit which attracted much attention in the recent past by summoning a series of high profile politicians of the previous regime had decided to postpone the arrest of any such person against whom probes had been conducted and concluded, until the end of the elections, the source disclosed.
	Instead of arresting politicians regardless of their background or themagnitude of their crimes, the FCID will seek Attorney Generals advice on each case, and act after the polls are concluded.
	However, a source told Daily Mirror that none of the ongoing probes had been stalled or slowed down as alleged by some. He said the investigations were proceeding at a steady pace.
	Recent moves to summon Western Province Chief Minister Prasanna Ranatunga, and his attempts to seek an interim order against his arrest, plus a letter from the Elections Commissioner to allow all politicians to conduct their campaigns without prejudice were he main reasons for the decision, the source said.
	Prasanna Ranatunga was first summoned to the FICD on July 13, the day nominations closed.
	The unit has received over 1000 complaints regarding major and minor financial crimes, said to have been committed mostly under the previous regime. (Kurulu Koojana Kariyakarawana)
