A video posted by a popular ‘gossip’ website Lanka e News (LEN) was circulating on social media showing Police Chief Pujith Jayasundara manhandling two minor staffers of the Police Headquarters, who claimed to have disobeyed departmental rules of performing the morning meditation.

Although the video has been posted on the LEN website this morning following a written description pertaining to the visuals it carried, the actual incident depicted on the footage had reportedly taken place on April 11 this year, as mentioned by the gossip site.

The video which seemed to have been captured from the Police Headquarters’ CCTV cameras fixed in and outside the main elevator of the lobby shows Mr. Jayasundara manhandling a person in civvies by his shirt collar and threateningly gestures to slap another man in plain clothing who acts as the lift operator.

In the second frame it shows the IGP pointing his finger at someone who’s remaining beyond the camera’s point of view and blaming in a dramatic style.

Although the audio of the footage was not available it was evident that he was expressing his displeasure at the junior staffers.

When contacted Police Spokesman SP Ruwan Gunasekara told the Daily Mirror this was a trivial incident where the IGP as the head of the department reprimanded some staffers who had failed to adhere to the morning meditation sessions.

To cultivate good thoughts and sound mindset of all policemen a ten minute meditation session has been introduced by IGP Jayasundara since assuming office in April last year.

“The session is held every morning at 8.30 to 8.45 right after playing national anthem and police anthem. All Buddhists have been instructed to engage in the meditation session whilst the rest of the non-Buddhists had been asked to observe their religious prayers within this period.

This rule had been enforced on all policemen in Police Headquarters and police stations countrywide.

However, those assigned on special duties such as at 119 emergency telephone service, sentry and guard points as well as policemen in charge of receiving complaints at respective stations are exempted from practising this morning rule as it would disturb the general public,” the spokesman said.

“Since this novel concept is embraced by many optimistic policemen in the department and follow with heart and soul it had helped to make a revolutionary change in the way how police officers approach their daily duties with a sound and positive mindset.

During the period this meditation is practiced and except for those who are exempted from following it, there shouldn’t be any activity or movement of staffers allowed within the department including the lift operator. Since nobody is moving during this period it was questionable as to why the lift operator had disobeyed to practice his meditation,” SP Gunasekara said.

Emphasizing on certain admirable qualities of the incumbent Police Chief, SP Gunasekara said the former had managed to clear over 8, 000 personal files of various grievances of police officers which had been stagnating for over a decade, within a year of his appointment.

He said he would personally testify that as the Director of Police Discipline and Conduct Division, the IGP had given solutions to all these grievances pertaining to the promotions, transfers, delayed justice of inquiries, pensions etc.

Meanwhile, attempts made to get through to IGP Jayasundara over the phone for his comment was unsuccessful. (Kurulu Koojana Kariyakarawana)
