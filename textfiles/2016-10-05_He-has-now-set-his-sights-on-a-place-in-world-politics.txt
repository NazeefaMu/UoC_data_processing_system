A politico from the South holding a key portfolio in yahapalanaya who has reportedly grown sick of party politics in the country has set his heart on securing a high post in a world organization, they say. 

 


This politico who entered national politics from an electorate bordering River Nilwala has since then held high office under regimes led by both main political parties during his 27-year political career.
He has told his colleagues that his views ware too liberal and too independent to suit party politics in this country and he could be much more comfortable and productive in a position in the world political scene.


By the way, certain statements this politico made in the recent past sparked off much controversy and drew much flak from the Sinhala extremists in particular. 


The portfolio the politico is holding now is an ideal stepping stone to the high office in the world organization he is said to be seeking.
