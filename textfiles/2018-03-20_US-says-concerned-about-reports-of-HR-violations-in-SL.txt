The US yesterday said it was concerned about ongoing reports of human rights violations and abuses in Sri Lanka by members of the security services and recent attacks targeting members of religious minority communities.

In its statement to the 37th Session of the UNHRC, the Permanent Mission of the US in Geneva said it urges the Sri Lankan government to hold accountable all those responsible for human rights abuses and violations and to protect religious minorities and their places of worship.  

“We further urge the government to take additional steps to fully implement the commitments it made in HRC resolution 30/1 and reaffirmed in HRC resolution 34/1. We look forward to seeing Sri Lanka’s progress on implementing the UPR recommendations accepted by the government over the next five years as well,” it said

The US welcomed the Sri Lankan Government’s decision to accept US’s recommendations on full implementation of HRC resolution 30/1 and on accountability for the government’s, including the security forces, human rights violations and abuses, as well as accountability for those responsible for harassment and violence against members of religious minority communities.

“We are pleased with the Government’s support for these recommendations,” it said.
