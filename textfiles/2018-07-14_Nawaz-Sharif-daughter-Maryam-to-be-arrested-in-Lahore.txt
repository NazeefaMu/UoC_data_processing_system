Lahore, (Hindustan Times), July 13, 2018 - Pakistan’s embattled former prime minister Nawaz Sharif and his daughter Maryam are set to arrive in Lahore on Friday to face arrest in a corruption case, amid high security and a massive crackdown on his party activists.  


The Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz leader and his daughter stopped over in Abu Dhabi on their way to Pakistan from London. They are expected to land at Lahore’s Allama Iqbal International Airport at 6.15 PM (local time) on Etihad Airways flight EY243, the Dawn reported. The two PML-N leaders are returning to Pakistan to face a prison sentence handed out on July 6 by an accountability court in the Avenfield properties case, one of the three corruption cases against him following the Panama Papers scandal.  


Sharif and Maryam have been sentenced to 10 and 7 years in jail respectively.  


Sharif, who was in London with his wife and children when the verdict was announced, said he is returning to Pakistan from London to fulfil his pledge to “honour the vote”.
