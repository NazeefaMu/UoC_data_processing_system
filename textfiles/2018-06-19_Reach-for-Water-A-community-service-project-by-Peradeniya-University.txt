The Charity run of the signature community service project ‘REACH FOR WATER’ of the Rotaract Club of University of Peradeniya ended in high spirits, gifting Kandy a massive ‘charity run’ experience. Chronic Kidney Disease of Unknown etiology (CKDU) is a much discussed, yet less addressed issue. This project ‘Reach for Water’ was designed to address this issue, by ensuring the access to clean water.   


The first phase was a charity run which was organized to raise awareness amongst public about the Kidney Disease issue prevalent in the country and to raise funds. This charity run took place through the Kandy town starting from the Bogambara Stadium Car Park, under the patronage of the Central Province Chief Minister Sarath Ekanayake. Mayor Kesara Senanayake, Basnayaka Nilame Mahendra Ratwatte, Commissioner of Kandy Municipal Council Chandana Tennakoon, Paul Harris Fellow Rotarian and Past President John Baskaran from Rotary Club of Kandy also graced the occasion.   


At the closing ceremony, an awareness event was arranged with an expert talking on the kidney issue, and  a celebrity meet-and-greet arranged along with a musical event. The celebrities were Kavinga Perera, Ridma Weerawardhana, Supun Perera, Yomal Samarakoon, Samare & Samare, and Amuthu was the band in attendance. The sponsors were LTL Holdings, Rupavahini, Nestle, Sun Aqua and private donors. All the registrants were sporting the T-shirt and the wrist band which was designed as a fund raiser to the event. Media coverage was given by Rupavahini, Janasarana, Kandy zone and Pera Beats. Daily Mirror and Ceylon Today were the print media partners.   


The funds raised were channeled to the water filter installation at Galamuna Divisional Hospital at Budhdhayaya Polonnaruwa area, which will take place in the near future, and for the refurbishment of the temple at Uva Kudaoya, Wellawaya in collaboration with the Janasarana fund. Special measures were taken to ensure the sustainable existence of the project, where letters of consent were taken from the relevant parties assuring the acceptance of the responsibility to maintain the water filter.  The Reach for Water-2018 project showed it’s momentum, and ended with promising future prospects.
