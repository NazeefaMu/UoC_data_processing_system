	The investigations on the incident in Embilipitiya, where a young man was killed, took a dramatic turn as it had been revealed now that no one had informed the Police about a clash to Police on the Police Emergency hotline 119, Minister of Law and Order Sagala Ratnayake said in Parliament today.
	The Minister told Parliament at an earlier date that the Police had gone to the location after they received a phone call on 119.
	Minister Ratnayake, who made a special statement in the House said it had been two Constables, who had informed the Police that they had received information that there had been an issue with regard to use of loud speakers.
	The Minister said the statements would be recorded from the witnesses that had been named by the wife of the victim Sumith Prasanna.
	However, he said there was no proper evidence to determine how the victim died.
	He said the only available evidence was the information given by the wife of the owner of the house, where the clash had taken place.
	Minister Ratnayake said action would be taken against the Police officers involved if it was determined that they had assaulted the victim and the others, who were in the house at that time. (Yohan Perera)
