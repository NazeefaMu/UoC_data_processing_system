Kashmir ‘an integral part’ of Pakistan: Sharif


	

Claiming that Kashmir was an “integral part” of Pakistan, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif on Thursday needled India yet again by praising slain Hizb-ul-Mujahideen militant Burhan Wani as a “vibrant and charismatic leader.”  


Addressing the inaugural ceremony of a two-day international parliamentary seminar on Kashmir here, Mr. Sharif also praised the spirit and determination of the Kashmiri people for their struggle for the right to self-determination.  


“Our hearts beat and sink with our Kashmiri brethren,” Radio Pakistan quoted Mr. Sharif as saying.  
The world needs to tell India that “enough is enough” with regard to its policy towards Kashmir, he said, while asserting that Kashmir is an “integral part” of Pakistan. He claimed the “martyrdom of vibrant and charismatic Kashmiri leader Burhan Wani has given a new turn to the Kashmiri movement.”  


The Pakistan premier regretted the “Indian aggression” against Kashmiri people in the wake of protests triggered by the killing of Wani by security forces on July 8.  


Mr. Sharif said supporting the Kashmiri struggle for their right to self-determination was the faith of every Pakistani. 


ISLAMABAD, (The Hindu), January 05.01.2017 -  

He said Pakistan would continue to extend moral, political and diplomatic support to the Kashmiri people in their indigenous struggle and continue to shake the conscience of the international community for their rights.
