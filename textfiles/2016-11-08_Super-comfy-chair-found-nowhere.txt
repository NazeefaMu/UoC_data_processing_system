Super-comfy chair found nowhere


	



It is a general opinion in the country that politicians holding high office are a tribe seeking a life of luxury at public expense. 


Some such political high-ups not content with ‘ordinary’ luxuries are out to enjoy super-luxuries. Here is a case in point: A certain Minister has acquired a multi-purpose super-luxury chair at the cost of Rs.5 lakhs. This expensive chair is said to be equipped with a number of ‘utility’ features which an ordinary swivel chair does not have.
Even the authorities in the highest echelons in the country are not provided with super-luxury chairs like this to perch their posteriors on, they say.
