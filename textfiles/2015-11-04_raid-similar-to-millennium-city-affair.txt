Law and Order Minister Tilak Marapana today told Parliament that the Police had raided the Avant-Garde floating armoury ship at the Galle Harbour soon after the election to 'score point'. While dismissing allegations over the whole matter, the Minister stated that it was similar to the millennium city affair in 2002. “The reality was that,” he said.
Speaking during an adjournment debate on the company’s dealings in Parliament, minister Marapana said facts have been distorted to create a wrong picture in the minds of the people.
He said the company had only helped the Government to find some lost arms. “It was Avant-Garde Head Nisssanka Senadipathi had only helped in recovering a portion of lost arms,” the Minister said while mentioning that even the Navy could not manage to recover them in the mid sea.
Mr. Marapana was questioned by several MPs, including TNA MP M. A. Sumanthiran as to how he could speak in Parliament when he was the lawyer retained by Mr. Senadipathi. The Minister who responded said only one side of the story would be recorded if he does not speak on the issue.
Meanwhile, Minister of Justice Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe referring to the allegations made against Attorney General over the Avant-Garde case, also stated that nothing shady had taken place in the case.
Several MPs, including Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake alleged that the AG had tried to cover up the case.
Further Mr. Rajapaksa said it was he who prevented the arrest of Former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa against whom serious allegations had been made. (Yohan Perera)
