Gravity of domestic violence highlighted

Some Sri Lankan children say that the happiest day in their life is the day that their father died. This shows the gravity of domestic violence that exists in some Sri Lankan homes, consultant obstetrician and gynecologist Dr. Lakshman Senanayake said.
Dr. Senanayake said children in 50 percent of families undergo domestic violence and are beaten up.
Children who become victims of domestic violence develop stammering and urinate in bed at night. They also face panic attacks often. Female children who face domestic violence get used to tolerate it and think it is normal while the boys learn to use domestic violence as a tool of control once they grow up, he said.
"A majority of female schoolchildren face harassment while waiting for buses. A national level action plan is in the offing to ensure the safety of women and children.The Media Ministry will contribute towards this plan immensely," Dr. Senanayake said.
Consultant Community Physician Dr. Sanjeewa Godakandage said a study revealed that 77 percent of Sri Lankan women in the reproductive age need a family planning method because they are at risk of getting pregnant and around 90 percent of Sri Lankan women expect only two children.
"Still 7.1 percent of Sri Lankan women do not use a proper family planning method," he said.
