Unerringly just and fair towards all beings
	
JANAKA BOGOLLAGAMA:
Its hard to believe that Janaka, a man full of life, the joys of spring, joiedevirve and generosity of spirit has been gone for seven years. I was very close to this family for many years, shared in all their moments of joy, sorrow, and celebration. When he was struck down with this fatal illness, I spent much time in hospital talking to him in his room, sometimes on my own, often with Sunetra, his devoted wife, who had to be persuaded to go home and rest from time to time. In the time that we were on our own, Janakas main subjects of conversation were his worries about his children and his wife; he was concerned as to how they would fare without his presence which was their constant symbol of stability. He had provided for them, more than abundantly, but he knew they had to be guided on using their vast resources wisely and guiding their own destinies, with wisdom, business acumen and foresight. Next to his family, his main concern was Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, he was one like me and a handful of others, whose loyalty to the PM stood firmly and surely right through, unmoved by the shifting sands of victory and defeat. I recall an instance when I was sitting by him, when Ranil came to see him in hospital, he was very ill but his face lit up with joy and he forgot his own pain and worries about his family while he talked to his distinguished visitor.
Janaka was a rare being, always thinking of others and how he could help them to weather the storms and tempests of life. He had absolutely no deviousness and never played both sides against the middle. He was a model employer, deeply loved by all his employees, who he cared for as if they were his own family and they adored and respected him in return. His generosity to the underprivileged in all categories, the needy, injured soldiers, families of those killed in battle, victims of the Tsunami, to temples in all parts of our country, in addition to his hometown, Kurunegalla and the NWP have been of great magnitude. His death has and always will be a great loss to the UNP. He never spared time or expense if the party was in need. For me too, it is a loss of a friend who is difficult to replace. He would call me often to ask for my advice on personal matters and drop in with mangoes and coconuts for me. His love of sports was perhaps the inspiration for his unerring sense of justice and fair play towards all beings.To find these qualities today, in whatever field one might think of is like finding a needle in a haystack.

His love of sports was perhaps the inspiration for his unerring sense of justice and fair play towards all beings

Janaka was at school at Ananda College and wad Public schools champion in tennis. He played this game right through to the end till his illness compelled him to give it up. He was President of the Badminton Association in the North Western Province,President of the Kurunegala club for 15 years and the only person from an outstation to be President of the SLTA. He was also President of the Wayamba Chamber of Commerce. Although a devout Buddhist, as a benefactor to one and many, he thought far beyond the narrow peripheries of caste, race or creed. He has helped families in Trincomalee, and later did the same after the tsunami. He sponsored almost all sports events in Kurunegala and built seven temples in NWP, but never rejected pleas from Churches and other religious organisations for help, all these were given with his kind smile. Janaka thrived on freedom and was a free spirit. His life has left a gaping vacuum in the lives of his family and all who loved him. I can think of no better words than those of Christina Rossetti, which I think Janka would be saying to his family and all those who loved him.
Remember me when I am gone away
Gone far away to the silent land.
When you can no more hold me by the hand, nor I half turning to go, yet turning stay.
Remember me when no more day by day, you tell me of our future that you planned.
Only remember me, you understand. It will be too late to counsel then or pray.
Yet if you should forget me for a while and afterwards remember, do not grieve. 
For if the darkness and corruption leave, a vestige of the thoughts that I once had. Better by far you should forget and smile,than you should remember and be sad.

## Title: Dengue  strikes  again!

Dengue  strikes  again!
	
Tightening our belts before
The threat of Dengue is a dark shadow looming in the Sri Lankan horizons, waiting to strike as soon as an opportunity presents itself. At the time of writing as many as 162952 cases of dengue have been reported; an all time high. Though the number of dengue patients has been declining since the end of July, as per the data provided by the Epidemiology Unit, the public have raised their suspicions regarding this figure because they feel it can rise given the wet weather experienced in most parts of the country. The Daily Mirror contacted Dr. Prachila Samaraweera of the National Dengue Control Unit to clear the doubts regarding the magnitude of the threats associated with the rise in dengue. 
Yes, we have identified a slight possibility of an increase in dengue in the coming few weeks, with the rain favouring the breeding of the mosquito. We are currently taking action to minimize the spread of the disease in areas which are at a higher risk. For an example, we carried out dengue prevention programmes in Jaffna following an increased number of patients and weve had less patients being reported afterwards, she replied. 
Samaraweera also said that the authorities have observed an increase in Dengue cases around this time of the year in previous years as well. The data obtained from the Epidemiology Unit, showing the spread of Dengue cases throughout the year over the past few years also reveals that even though the highest number of cases is reported around 25-30 week of the year, there is a slight peak after around 42 weeks. 
two monsoon seasons
To quote the research paper published in 2017 on the Effect of Climatic Factors and Population Density on the Distribution of Dengue in Sri Lanka, by P.D.N.N. Sirisena and the others, With two monsoon seasons in Sri Lanka, the absolute number of dengue and severe Dengue cases peak twice annually. The first peak occurs in June/July that coincides with the South Western monsoon due to the rainfall that starts in April. The second peak occurs between the end of the year and early January next year which is associated with the North Eastern monsoon that occurs from October to December. This also indicates a possibility of an oncoming rise in Dengue cases. 
After the epidemic proportion dengue outbreak that we experienced during the middle of the year, being aware of a possibility of Dengue making a significant comeback is of utmost importance. By anticipating the event, we can be better prepared, thus minimizing its damage. What can we do to prepare for this challenge 
 Always be alert, and watch out for possible mosquito breeding places during this rainy season, cautioned Dr. Samaraweera. She also advised to give special attention to work places and schools, as well as residences and the surroundings, since these are the places where one spends most of the time during the day.

As most of our readers are already aware of, contracting of Dengue needs fulfilling of three criteria. First, there should be a carrier, who has the Dengue virus in his bloodstream. Then there should be the mosquito that can transmit the virus by first biting the carrier and getting the infected blood into its body. The third criterion is for the infected mosquito to bite a healthy uninfected person, releasing the virus into his or her bloodstream. 
detecting an outbreak
When it comes to the prevention of dengue, in addition to destroying the mosquito breeding grounds, its important to prevent the mosquitoes from getting infected from the diseased carriers, so that they cant spread the disease further, said Dr. Hasitha Udalagama, Resident House Officer at the Base Hospital Nikaweratiya. The best thing to do is being alert about fever in endemic areas, thereby enabling early detection. When a patient is identified with a certain community (village, scheme, street, work place etc.), measures should be taken to limit the transmission from that person. These measures include keeping that person inside a net for about 5 days, using repellents and taking other measures to prevent mosquito bites in the neighbourhood and eliminating breeding sites. Reporting the cases (notification by health professionals) is vital in detecting an outbreak, he further explained. 
The objective of this article is not to unduly alarm our readers with a dire warning of an impending threat of Dengue. Rain is only one factor amongst many that contributes to the rise in Dengue cases. When it comes to the spread of Dengue many other external factors like temperature, humidity and urbanization have been found to positively correlate with the spread of Dengue. Therefore, with so many factors contributing to the disease, no one can predict exactly what would happen in the future regarding the dengue situation. Does this mean that we should cross our arms and allow fate to decide when disaster should strike next We should not forget that among the uncontrollable things like rains or the winds, there are modifiable factors. These things which are under the control of the average human like you and I have the greatest impact on the spread of Dengue. By reducing mosquito breeding grounds and by minimizing the spread of the disease through the carriers, we can lessen the impact of the demon waiting to strike. In other words, we may not prevent the hazard, but by being prepared and working together, we can certainly impede its progression towards disaster.

200 feared dead in N. Korean mine collapse
	
At least 200 North Korean labourers had been reportedly killed after a mine shaft which is being dug at a nuclear test site collapsed, the Telegraph reported today quoting Asahi TV.
Sources in North Korea had told the news channel that a tunnel being excavated by around 100 workers at the Punggye-ri test site collapsed earlier this month.
An additional 100 labourers who were sent to rescue trapped labourers had also been reportedly killed when the tunnel suffered a second collapse.
An exact date for the disaster has not been provided, but it comes shortly after North Korea conducted its sixth - and most powerful - underground nuclear test at the site.
North Korea claims the September 3 test beneath Mount Mantap was of a hydrogen bomb, with monitors suggesting the detonation was equivalent to an earthquake with a magnitude of 6.1 on the Richter scale.
Some analysts put the yield of the weapon as high as 280 kilotons, while seismologists picked up signs of underground collapses in the hours and days after the blast.
Satellite images of the Punngye-ri site taken immediately after the test revealed significant damage to surface features, including landslips.

## Title: Fitch Affirms National Insurance Trust Fund at AA-(lka)

Fitch Affirms National Insurance Trust Fund at AA-(lka)
	
Fitch Ratings has affirmed Sri Lanka-based National Insurance Trust Fund Boards (NITF) National Insurer Financial Strength Rating (IFS) and National Long-Term Rating at AA-(lka).
The Outlook is Stable. NITFs ratings reflect strong ties with the government of Sri Lanka (B+/Stable), a strong business profile as the countrys only re-insurer and a conservative investment policy. This is counterbalanced by weakened capitalisation due to natural disasters in 2016 and 2017 and high dividend payments.
NITFs ratings reflect its 100 percent ownership by the Government of Sri Lanka, its role as the countrys only re-insurer and its function as an arm of the state in implementing some policies, such as serving segments that are not covered by commercial insurers.
The companys combined ratio rose to 134 percent in 1H17 and 76 percent in 2016 (2015: 53 percent) following back-to-back floods in May 2016 and May 2017 and a prolonged drought in several parts of the country. This led to losses in NITFs reinsurance, disaster management and crop insurance classes. Net profit dropped to LKR3.1 billion in 2016 (2015: LKR4.3 billion), while 1H17 recorded a LKR1 billion loss. Profitability is likely to recover in 2H17, absent further catastrophic events, as NITFs core profitability remains strong.
The regulatory risk-based capital (RBC) ratio dropped to 178 percent by end-June 2017, from 558 percent at end-March 2017, due to disaster-related losses incurred in 2Q17 and an interim dividend payment to the state. Capitalisation is likely to recover alongside improving profit in 2H17, but could come under further pressure if NITF continues paying high dividends. NITF paid out 103 percent of profits in 2016 and 70 percent in 2015.
NITF has increased retention of excess-of-loss reinsurance contracts, which cover the reinsurance and natural disaster classes, to LKR1.5 billion and LKR1.0 billion, respectively, from LKR1.0 billion and LKR0.5 billion in 2016. As such, the company is exposed to high catastrophe event risk that could threaten its capital position.
Flood related claims in 2016 of LKR8.6 billion on NITFs reinsurance and disaster-management classes were limited to LKR2.2 billion due to reinsurance cover. However, losses stemming from the May 2017 floods increased to an estimated LKR2.6 billion, as NITF will have to bear the entire LKR1.6 billion in disaster-management-related claims. This was due to a delay in government approval, which resulted in NITFs 2017-2018 reinsurance cover for this class coming into effect only after the floods.
NITFs ratings also reflect the companys strong business profile, which is underpinned by its role as Sri Lankas only re-insurer and its established products, which include Agrahara, the countrys largest health-insurance scheme covering all state-sector employees and their families. NITF also manages the Strike, Riot, Civil Commotion and Terrorism Fund (SRCCT), which is available to all insurers in Sri Lanka. Local regulation requires all non-life operators to cede 30 percent of their reinsurance to NITF.
It is believed that NITFs reserves lack sophistication, but there have been some improvements, such as obtaining external certification for the first time in 2016. According to management, NITFs liabilities are mainly short-tail in nature and estimated by the company to be less than one year. The NITF Act only permits the company to invest funds in government securities and equity of hospital projects. NITFs entire investment portfolio is fully invested in government securities.
NITFs ratings would be downgraded if its RBC ratio remains below 250 percent or its combined ratio is above 100 percent for a sustained period, or if there is a weakening in its business profile. Ratings could also be downgraded if NITFs importance to the state weakens. This could be reflected in a reduction in government-related business.
An increase in NITFs market share, together with strong profitability and capitalisation, as well as better risk management would lead to a rating upgrade.

From the bloodstained pages of a war album
	
A woman Tiger cadre recalls memories of the final days of Mullivaikkal before the security forces exploded into action

Single Death is a Tragedy; a Million Deaths is a Statistic.
This atrocious, but pathetically true statement has been ascribed to the longest serving President of the now defunct Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), Joseph Stalin.
The statement is perfectly true in the eyes of the people in the southern parts of this country in respect of what happened in the battlefront during the final few weeks of the war between Government security forces and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). 
We now know that more than three hundred thousand people had been entrapped in an area less than one square kilometre in the littoral of Mullivaikkal in the Mullaitivu District during those final days of the war. All three hundred thousand men, women and children undeniably must have had three hundred thousand harrowing tales to tell. 
They were caught in between the security forces and the LTTE, which too had an army, navy and an air force then, but desperately using the civilians as a human shield, while being on the run in May, 2009. But, as stated by Stalin we know only the diverse statistics of people trapped, killed wounded and maimed in the war- the statistics put forward by various people, according to their political affiliations and agendas of their organisations.
hapless people
But, we dont know how these hapless people under siege escaped from the many showers of flying bullets fired by both sides and the shrapnel of bombs and shells exploded amidst them. Neither do we know how they were forced out from their homes to be ensnared between warring parties, what they ate, fed their children, how they carried their elderly and critically wounded loved ones from place to place for safety during that tormenting entrapment, nor do we know how they broke the LTTE siege finally in order to enter into the areas held by the security forces or their first encounter after that with those forces.
Its only a well versed person in story telling who was also unfortunate to be an eye-witness of this horrendous battlefield who would be able to visualize in us, the horrible picture of the nerve-racking situation in Mullivaikkal. Velu Chandrakala, an LTTE woman cadre who surrendered to the Army at Mullivaikkal, three days before the security forces sealed victory, is no doubt qualified to relate to us that traumatic and pathetic story. She had fought for 18 long years for a separate Tamil State, losing an eye and a hand in an explosion, before she dissociated with her gun and the cyanide capsule. 
Chandrakala who had been given the nom de guerre Vetrich Chelvi by the LTTE provides a graphic detail of the situation during those hellish few days in her book titled Eelap Porin Iruthi Natkal (Last Days of Eelam War). She seems to have acquired her captivating language evinced in the book by working as a journalist for the Suthanthira Paravaikal newspaper and as an announcer of the Puligalin Kural Radio, two media arms of the LTTE.
It was a story of the hell. It was the story of around three hundred thousand unarmed civilians from four districts, Mannar, Vavuniya, Mullaitivu and Kilinochchi who had been restricted within a small area which during the final week of the war. This place is said to have been shrunk to the size of about two football grounds! 
Also it was a war between a ruthless rebel group on the wane which was moving among the besieged people and three armed forces launching attacks with similar ferocity, from the land, sea and the sky. The armed forces had been determined to destroy the enemy, at the first ever opportunity that came their way during the past three decades. 
Horror summarised
Vetrich Chelvi summarises the horror people were facing in one simple paragraph, but in a sensitive way. The body of a young child in the cradle would be blown into pieces, the hand that reaches the mouth with a piece of bread would be severed off instantly by a flying shrapnel, a small girl running to take shelter in a bunker would lose her leg with a thundering bang. In every minute human organs were being severed away 
What was revealed just now isnt from a frame of a horror movie or a page from a novel. This was a real time plight that was undergone by a group of human beings in this country some eight years ago. She further explains, No family was without a story of a death. Not a second passed without wails and cries around. Everybody was hit. All men, women and children struggled to endure pain. All were on the move with no aim, irrespective of them being combatants or civilians. Anybody who wished to relax for a moment had to lose either life or limbs.
Being a trained combatant of the LTTE, Vetri as her friends called her, explains in the book how the battlefront situation changed in favour of the armed forces and how the people reacted to it. She first tells about her organisations heyday. Any military thrust of any magnitude by the troops was defeated in a few hours or within a day. At the end of the battle the Liberation Tigers piled up hundreds of weapons and bodies of the army personnel in the Kilinochchi playground, says Vetrich Chelvi. Then she relates how their fortune wore off. The Armed forces attempting to breach the defences of the Tigers in all fronts first found their way into the Tiger held territory in the Western front. They advanced along the roads opened up in Mannar, Adampan, Pallikkuli and Madhu. Next, the Kilinochchi town began to quake by the thunders of the Kfirs. Hundreds of buildings were flattened by the bombs dropped by the Kfirs and MiG aircraft. Lives too charred with them. Not a single day passed without Eelanatham newspaper carrying stories of airstrikes
On-the-job training
Militant did not have sufficient time or places to train their new recruits. It was the real-time battlegrounds that became target practice ranges. It was on-the-job training. But they did not have their enemy within their sight to shoot. It was the rain of shells launched by the enemy that swept away the frontlines of the militants
People started to bitterly criticize the struggle when they had to face repeated defeats and losses. But they were not so unmoved not to refuse requests for blood for injured fighters. Their earnest passion and craving for the separate State had not been lostThey cursed the fighters who were involved in recruiting new combatants, but at the same time served those who returned exhausted from battlefront, with food, reminisces Vetrich Chelvi. 

No family was without a story of a death. Not a second passed without wails and cries around. Everybody was hit. All men, women and children struggled to endure pain. All were on the move with no aim, irrespective of them being combatants or civilians
Despite the cruelty that was present, people as well as the rebels had to sustain their lives, feed their loved ones, treat their seriously wounded family members and look after their elderly parents and grandparents while protecting all of them from the bullets and shrapnel chasing them helter-skelter. The author relates of a story of a fellow woman combatant who had to jump into the bunker four times while cooking a pot of rice on the fire nearby.
There had been one or two land phones still amazingly functioning in the battlefront and the LTTE had made them available to the people to relate their woes to friends and relatives living outside their cordoned off tiny world. But Vetrich Chelvi says the people waiting hours in long queues for telephone calls were always being dispersed by the killer shells that fell and exploded in close proximity to them, sometimes killing and injuring civilians and combatants. 
The book, in a way, is an indictment against the LTTE for its presence among the civilians even when they were in the State declared safe zones. Though the LTTEs presence might have invited shells from the armed forces into the areas occupied by the civilians, it also seems to have reduced the chaotic situation among the people, as the outfit had been organising the distribution of food, medical and other logistic facilities.
Cyanide capsule
Vetrich Chelvi was determined to bite her cyanide capsule in case of arrest by the armed forces or being forced to surrender during these decisive days. But she was in a quandary when the people started to move into the army held areas and it was clear that the army would reach them in about half an hour. The reaction by her colleagues to the peoples desertion of them and the armys rapid approach was mixed with some being told to have bitten the Kuppi, as they called the cyanide capsule that was hung from their necks while the majority of them had chosen to go to the enemy, she said. 
Vetrich Chelvis kuppi was removed by one of her aunts who took care of her during the final three days in Mullivaikkal, as the latter saw her touching it several times with each word about the approaching army. 
Similar to Thamilini, the womens Political Wing Leader of the LTTE explaining in her book, Oru Koor Valin Nilalil (under the shadow of a sharp sword) how she changed her mind before giving her up to the army, Vetri too finally deceives herself into justifying her decision to dissociate with her kuppi, gun and the uniform in order to mingle with the massive procession of civilians that was moving towards the army frontline. She explains the struggle that continued with her mind;
Why should I surrender What is the use of living any longer Is anybody going to put up a stage and tell the world that this was how we died Should we die only when people are to tell the world My inner mind questioned. The answer was in the negative. But isnt it going to be a death uninformed even to our parents Deaths occur without their causes being unidentified in a war. But why should I die when there is no longer any war
Had I died before, it would have been a death of a heroine. Hereafter, it would be a murder or a suicide. The struggle within the mind was multifaceted. I was ambivalent. 
Finally a young boy who had been bringing them news from other bunkers guides them to face the reality. Akka, have a change and get out of the place immediately. Dont think about biting the kuppi. Even if you die there wouldnt be anybody to tell that three people died this way, the boys had reasoned. 
He was correct. So many cadres of the outfit had died after biting the kuppi inside their bunkers, according to the boy. But except for that reference in Vetrich Chelvis book, all those deaths had gone unnoticed in the pandemonium that had prevailed.
double agents
Vetrich Chelvi explains her life in the welfare camp for women cadres in a separate book titled Aarip Pona Kaayangalin Vali (The pain in healed wounds) which she had described as the part II of Eelap Porin Iruthi Natkal. 
After her surrender to the army she was amazed to see several of her organizations intelligence officers receiving the civilians coming into the armys frontline, on behalf of the army and organizing transport and food for them. In fact, they had been army moles among Pottu Ammans men. One such double agent among army personnel had even advised them in public to behave in a manner that should protect the good name of their organization. 
She speaks of kind hearted men and women along with rude and racist people among the army personnel in welfare camps. She recalls a particular handsome youth among them who had fascinated her with his charming look as well as his respected and kind behaviour. He had called the people under the army custody Akka and Anna (brother) irrespective of some of them being LTTE cadres who had fought a bitter war with his colleagues, until a few days ago. 
Vetrich Chelvi recalls another incident where the inmates of the LTTE women cadres were furious about a news item published in an Indian Tamil magazine that claimed that women in Sri Lankan welfare camps for northern Tamil civilians had been sexually molested by the soldiers. In which camp had such incidents happened she contests in Arip Pona Kayangalin Vali.

Govt. will go through a process of self criticism
	
The government will go through a process of self criticism in order to determine where it went wrong and rectify whatever shortcomings, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said yesterday.
The Prime Minister made this remark after releasing a report on the government's achievements during the past two years.
Mr Wickremesinghe said the government has not been able to secure a 5.5 per cent economic growth it expected to achieve as a result of floods, drought, Kolonnawa incident and dengue during the year.
However he said changes brought about in the economy had endured an economic growth of 4.5 percent. " Country would have ended up with a 2.5 percent growth if not for economic reforms brought about by the government' he said.
He said any party from any part of the world was welcome to buy over a stake of the Trincomalee Port. One should remember that the Trincomalee Port is going to play a major role in the region soon. The Indian Ocean is going to be a region which will have a vast growth and Trincomalee has to be a part of it" he said. At the same time he said Sri Lanka will have to work with India as the subcontinent will account for 40 of the growth of the Indian Ocean' the Prime Minister said.
Responding to the criticism that this government has failed to bring in infrastructure development as the previous regime did, the Prime Minister said this government does not intend to burden the people with more debt. "We don't want to dump money like the previous regime but will go on with developing after securing the economy" he said.
"The economy is central to every thing we have achieved. Without a strong economy we would not have been able to build houses, ensure that working people are getting decent wages. The progress report we put out today very clearly states that Sri Lanka is on the right track towards a better future ' he added. He said what the government did was bringing about s transformation.
" I was at the forefront of this transformation and had earned criticism for it especially from the media" he said.
Referring to the local government election he said the UNP will be contesting as an alliance with other allies. " Our party is ready for the elections " he said. (Yohan Perera)

Highlight people's fundamental and social rights in new constitution: JVP
	
JVP MP Vijitha Herath said today clauses to uphold the fundamental and social rights of the people should be included in the new Constitution before talking about issues of power devolution, federalism and giving more powers to provincial councils.
He said this during the Constitutional Assembly debate on the new Constitution and pointed out that the people's social rights including the right to education, health, drinking water and housing had not been included in the present constitution. He said the rights of all communities should be ensured to create national harmony.
"There is a discrimination with regard to the Tamil language in the Constitution. Both Sinhala and Tamil languages should be regarded as State languages. There are clear proposals to resolve language problems in the new Constitution and to ensure social rights," the MP said.
He said wrong decisions taken by the past rulers for their political ends led to the armed conflict and added that the governments had been unable to address the true reasons which led to the war.
The MP said the then government did not pay heed to the proposals made by the JVP to address the national problem.
He said the the JVP would support the Constitution on the basis that it could bring in at least short term solutions to the national problem, while the core need of the constitution should be to abolish the executive presidency, which the SLFP had no moral right to object.
The MP said there was no basis to call for the amalgamation of the North and the East as 33 per cent of the Sinhalese, Muslims and Tamils live in the East whereas 32 per cent of Tamils live in the North.
"We will not allow the amalgamation of the North and the East, which would not in any way contribute to addressing the national problem," he said.
Mr. Herath further said that the Provincial Council system was not a solution to the national problem, as had been clearly proven so far. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)

I prefer 2000 constitutional draft but will support interim report: Dilan
	
State Minister Dilan Perera said today he preferred the draft constitution which was presented to Parliament by the Chandrika Kumaratunga government in 2000 rather than the interim report presented by the Steering Committee.
The state minister said this during the constitution assembly debate on the Steering Committee report.
"Although I prefer the constitution drafted in 2000 I will support the interim report because of the need to fall in line with the decision of my party," he said.
The state minister said the draft in 2000 spoke about a united country where power was devolved without mention anything about Buddhism.
He said the SLFP would be flexible by the time the debate on the new constitution comes to an end.
"The SLFP will be more flexible especially on power sharing amid some groups threatening to bomb Parliament," the state minister said and added that the leaders of political parties which governed this country in the past have made mistakes.
"It took us 67 years to sing the national anthem in Tamil at the National Day celebrations," he added. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)

## Title: Improving health  and safety in  construction sites

Improving health  and safety in  construction sites
	
Construction is one of the most dangerous industries in the world. The ramifications of construction accidents are growing with a trend toward more complex projects, especially in developing countries like Sri Lanka. With industry booms and its gross product constantly increasing the number of accidents, death toll has remained stubbornly high.
Absolute mortality in the construction industry remains unacceptably high and those accidents can cause heavy losses of life and property which support the importance of construction safety management. The measurement and assessment of safety performance are therefore urgent and vital to improve safety management and to prevent accidents.
Local construction companies have a poor degree of risk awareness and do not deem health and safety as important. The objective of this research is therefore to understand the value of the health and safety policy as well as accidents that could be prevented by ensuring a good reporting system by analyzing mechanisms of injuries. According to the Labour Department of Sri Lanka, 500,000 man days are lost annually due to occupational health hazards.
Against this backdrop, my research reveals that many construction companies are unaware of safety policies and do not have safety officials. I randomly selected 30 construction companies and successfully returned 22. I had distributed 350 questionnaires and returned 305. The responses were comprised of 13.60% and 40.90% from micro and small construction companies respectively. On the other hand, the responses from medium and large scale companies were 22.27% and 18.18% respectively.
Possession of Health and Safety Policy
The possession of the health and safety policy is a legal requirement. It ensures the health and safety of employees as well as others affected by the organizations activities. The questionnaire explores the health and safety policy in construction companies and determines the general content of existing policies in these organizations. 68.18% of companies that participated in the questionnaire indicated they did not have a written health and safety policy, while only 3.81% had such a one.
From data available at the Labour Department, nearly 2,500 to 3,000 fatal and non-fatal accident reports are annually reported to industrial safety. Out of them, 40 to 60 are fatal and some 30% occur due to construction methodologies.
A survey conducted in the Accident and Orthopoaedic Service of the National Hospital of Sri Lanka (NHSL) in 2015 treated 102,321 victims of accidents. It shows 12% of the injuries are due to occupational health hazards. Out of the fatal accidents, 50% are from the construction industry. As such, the data given above are in contrast to the real situation.
According to recent statistics of the Labour Department, during 2012-10-01 to 2013-09-30, the number of accidents reported by employers stood at 392. During the same period, the Accident and Orthopoaedic Service of NHSL treated 11,047 victims (10.5%) of the total number of patients, and 105,217 were due to occupational injuries. The 2013 Performance Report of the Labour Department mentions that only 3.5% of employees have reported accidents. It is clear that there is no proper channel of information about accidents to the relevant authorities.
To reduce this burden, it is important to fathom the size and scope of the problem. This can be determined by the collection and analysis of safety-related data. However, there are no clearly-defined regional or institutional-based focal points for health information management. Some have developed information systems to cater to their needs, but we found that there was no proper means of data collection in the work zones. Therefore, we should introduce or establish an institution or ministry to gather data of accidents occurring in construction sites.
In Sri Lanka, the safety of workers in construction sites is woefully neglected. Many construction workers and owners of construction sites are unaware of the needy to deploy health and safety officials to the sites and even if they had such officers, they were not aware of safety protocols.
Relevant authorities and officials should understand the needs of the health and safety policy. My recommendations of the finding were that strong risk assessment, management and proper auditing procedures should be followed. Everything regarding the health and safety condition of workers should be listed and checked. Safety rules, reporting of injuries and illnesses, notifications, enforcement of the safety policy and first aid should be included in the list. The government should set up an independent State body to record incidents including accidents and illnesses in construction sites. It should monitor the mechanism of injury to look into ways of averting such accidents in the future after finding out how they took place. In Sri Lanka, having safety policies are not practical. Sri Lanka should have a safety policy more suited to the country and it should be enforced strictly.

JO to complain to IPU and CPA
	
The joint opposition (JO) today said some of its MPs would visit the Inter-Parliamentary Union while some others would visit the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association (CPA) to complain about the intimidation of JO MPs and the delaying of polls.
JO MP Bandula Gunawardana said a group of MPs led by JO national organiser and MP, Dullas Alahapperuma would visit the IPU head office in Geneva this week.
Another group led by JO parliamentary leader and MP, Dinesh Gunawardena and myself will leave for Bangladesh to complain to the CPA about current affairs and developments which violate democratic values, he told a news briefing.
The MP said JO MPs were being remanded without recourse to bail with their passports impounded which prevents them from travelling abroad to complain to the relevant authorities about injustice.
He said the government kept dragging the parliamentary voting time intentionally, to ensure that it could secure a two-thirds majority.
Sometimes, the government drags voting till MPs who had just become mothers come to Parliament for voting and debates. This is how it passes legislation, he said.
He said the JO would brief the IPU and the CPA regarding these issues, the delaying of polls for local government bodies and provincial councils, and the alleged doctoring of documents with statistics including that of budgetary proposals. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Later forays, lesser forays:  The man and the milieu
	
The fifth in a series of sketches of the films of Lester James Peries

Critics are so obsessed over separating the good from the bad, the merited and the prized from the spurned and the forgotten, in an artists career that they forget that what made the latter possible was the lesser aspects of the former. No one can deny that the later Hitchcock was bad (very few would contend otherwise), but no one can seriously deny that the Master of Suspense was being anyone other than the Master of Suspense in his later lesser films (Marnie, Torn Curtain, Topaz, but not Frenzy and the deliciously enjoyable Family Plot). The bottom line is this, therefore; what make the later forays of a director possible, more often than not, are his earlier excursions into lesser territory. This was as true for Hitchcock as it was for Lester James Peries.
Twenty (20) films over 50 years are not, to be honest, adequate to pass judgment on Lesters generally disregarded works, which fall under two broad categories; unqualified failures and unrealised masterpieces. Of those 20, interestingly however, only one can be singled out as a failure on any terms: The God King, back then the most lavishly financed production the West got involved with in the East (Kurosawa had backed out of Tora! Tora! Tora!). The God King was an unmitigated failure precisely because it was that; a production financed by another part of the world, over which technicians appointed elsewhere held sway. The final product  a strange mishmash of Manciewiczs Cleopatra and Mehboob Khans Aan  was as confused as the story of its troubled production, which as Lester recounted deserves an entire book to itself. 
The God King is so bizarre, its dialogues so outrageously and unintentionally funny (its campy flavour reminds you of Richard Burtons deadpan monologues from The Exorcist II: high-flown, profound, yet colossally empty and shallow), and the rift between its epic vistas and its anything-but-epic plotline (not for one moment does this rift relax, which is why it reminds me of what Gore Vidal once wrote of Ben-Hur, i.e. the 1959 version: Any attempt to make sense of it would destroy the storys awful integrity). Majestically conceived, majestically shot, it was ahead of its time in some respects (especially for Sri Lanka); in other respects, though, it was and remains as empty and hollow as the final battle between its antihero and his brother. 
There is as much of Lester in The God King as there was of Kubrick in Spartacus, and coupled with the fact that it failed financially and critically, this means that it was the first and only detour in the mans long career. To call it symptomatic of the kind of movies he was directing at that time would be stretching things too far, yet those who conflate the one with the other do so because the time he was in, and the material he had to work with, indicated a shift in the quality of his work that was discernible. But still, extrapolating from this and separating what is considered to be his lesser work from his masterpieces would be an injustice to him because, as I mentioned, much of what critics saw as lacking in his earlier work made its way visibly to his later forays.
Indian cinema
David Shipman in his monumental two-volume The Story of Cinema (for which he watched more than 5,000 movies) wrote about Lester in a chapter on the Indian cinema and Satyajit Ray. Having seen every film of his until Ahasin Polawata, except Sandeshaya and, rather strangely, Golu Hadawatha (he makes no mention of them), Shipman contended that inasmuch as Ray was great, Lester was hardly his inferior. But the Western critics lack of familiarity with the lives of ordinary people from this part of the world  be they Apu or Charulata or Nanda or Nissanka  showed clearly in Shipmans indictment of Lesters work as slow paced. Here he separated Ray and Peries: the formers films, while also slow, were more richly detailed. Even otherwise great essays as Delovak Athara and Akkara Paha were brought down; the former, otherwise interesting, fails, while the latter, at 132 minutes, is overdue.
true to Sinhala life
Even Philip Coorays book on the man, The Lonely Artist, reflects and affirms in part Shipmans views, ironic considering that Regi Siriwardenas foreword repudiates the indictment in clear-cut terms: I remember an irritated Mexican critic writing of Gamperaliya who said that every line spoken by the characters seems to be preceded and followed by a long silence. In this quality of his films, however, Lester is true to Sinhala life. Which is true of course: fiercely open we as a people are, we are nevertheless content not in revealing in gushes and torrents our torments and sorrows, but in hinting at them (as Anula Karunatilake does in Golu Hadawatha). But what is pertinent to note here is not whether Lester was being true to life as seen within (David Shipman on Gamperaliya: Im not sure whether it reveals the inner lives of its characters) but what flowed from this quality of his: the weaknesses that would adorn even his real masterpieces. Its pertinent in turn to mention them here.
It has been said that our movies are long and overdue and this because of poor planning, editing, scripting, and logistics. Such problems certainly did beset Lester, and they beset independent filmmakers even today, but while they are issues for which the director shouldnt be held accountable, they do give rise to other issues which are in part at least those of the director. In Lesters case, slow paced (tiring or otherwise) as his lesser works are, the qualities which they share with his earlier career are so discernible that they cant miss the careful, discriminating viewer.

It has been said that our movies are long and overdue and this because of poor planning, editing, scripting, and logistics. Such problems certainly did beset Lester, and they beset independent filmmakers even today

In his films, first and foremost, we come across a rift between the individual and his or her society: Sena and the rural peasantry in Rekava, Piyal and the feudal aristocracy in Gamperaliya, Nissanka and the urban bourgeoisie in Delovak Athara. This rift translates into another: between the individual and his or her milieu. The incongruity that results from it is very much present, and accounts at least partly for the strengths of Gamperaliya, Golu Hadawatha, Akkara Paha, and Nidhanaya over the weaknesses of Desa Nisa, Ahasin Polawata, Kaliyugaya, Awaragira, and Wekanda Walawwa.
**Its interesting to observe that almost all his later films were based on the uprooted elite, the aristocracy that he had eulogised in Gamperaliya and laid to rest in Nidhanaya. But in those two films the tension as such, between our protagonists and their social backdrops, were, while unresolved (Nidhanaya ends with two deaths, one murder and one suicide), never contradictory; the personal never transcended the milieu. You infer this when you compare Ahasin Polawata with Nidhanaya: both rely on pretty much the same technique, the flashback, but while the inhibitions of Willie Abeynayake are firmly and squarely the inhibitions of a decaying elite, the quirks of Sarath are (as Regi Siriwardena once observed) never rooted in anything substantive.
critical drubbing
Much of the critical drubbing that Lester endured from the late seventies to the early nineties  with Ahasin Polawata, Baddegama, Kaliyugaya, Yuganthaya, Awaragira  can be rooted in the lack of reconciliation between the milieu and the personal in those films, which isnt to say that he deserved that drubbing: on the contrary, they were symptomatic of the thinly disguised confusions that young critics entertained (our Marxist critics never really understood that the personal experience of a work of art need not always be at the cost of its political relevance; they always wanted political symbols for it to be relevant). But I believe that the weaknesses apparent in these five films  Ahasin Polawata with its depiction of Sarath; Baddegama with its miscast cast; Kaliyugaya with the discrepancy between its brilliantly sustained first half-hour and the rest of its duration; Yuganthaya for its lack of engagement with the political; and Awaragira with its maligned, quickly cut murder at the end  can be traced to a sustained incongruity between the individual and his or her backdrop.
And yet these are not unsalvageable films: hidden deep within, in several sequences, are feats of astounding technical craftsmanship. With a lavish score by Premasiri Khemadasa that identifies its protagonist with a poignant motif, Kaliyugayas first half-hour is a triumph in the use of the flashback in our cinema; Baddegama, while visually weak in many scenes (in Leonard Woolfs novel Silindu imagines seeing demons in the forest after he angers Punchirala, the exorcist; in the film the director and the scriptwriter provide a literal transposition of these imaginings, with demon faces leering from the trees and the bushes) does bring out some great performances from Joe Abeywickrama as Silindu and Nadeeka Gunasekara as Hinnihami (though not Vijaya Kumaratunga, whose portrayal of the small-time, naive Babun was at odds with his urbane background); while Awaragira is a monumental family epic (with Ranjan Ramanayakes finest performance to date, a pity considering that he never got offers for more films like it) that ends in a terrible murder by the daughter (Vasanthi Chathurani) of her own brother (Kamal Addararachchi) over her tormented love for her abusive husband (Lucky Dias, in one of his more memorable roles): the murder, finely shot and edited, reminds me of the murder of Zhinovy in Wajdas Siberian Lady Macbeth, which was also about a woman torn between two men.
Perhaps the most fitting epitaph to these later and lesser forays of Lester James Peries is this: in the end he gave what he had, genuinely but discriminatingly. And in the end we got out of them what we could have, again genuinely but discriminately.

License required for toddy tapping once again
	
The Finance and Mass Media Ministry today said obtaining a license for toddy tapping for coconut and palmyrah trees has been made mandatory once again.
However, toddy tapping from the Kithul tree has been exempted from the provision. It said the license could be obtained from the Excise Department and Divisional Secretaries.
According to the Excise Ordinance, a license was earlier required for toddy tapping. However, it was later amended in 2013 by exempting Kithul, Palmyrah and Coconut trees from the licensing system.
In a statement, the ministry said due to the amendment, the Excise Department had faced difficulties in monitoring the volume of liquor produced from toddy by distilleries for the purpose of collecting excise duty.
According to the new amendment, no toddy shall be drawn or lowered from coconut or palmyrah trees without a license.

LTTE and Diaspora are involved in bringing a New Constitution: Gota
	
Those who are now in the forefront of bringing a New Constitution are those who maintained that terrorism can never be defeated and peace would never dawn in our country. The LTTE and the Diaspora are involved in bringing a New Constitution, said former Defense Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa addressing an intellectual forum of the Eliya organization held in Kandy at the OK-J conference hall.
He said that the local and international groups which intimidated the former government are the ones who initiated in bringing a New Constitution. The attempt to bring in a New Constitution is purely for the need of these separatists and not the need of the common masses.
Speaking further he said that Eliya organization was started to say no to the New Constitution. Ours is not a racist organization, but one where all patriots and intellectuals who love the country have joined together. There are no extremists and racists in our organization.
Terrorism existed during different governments, and there was a group who spread the opinion world over expressing that terrorism can never be defeated and peace cannot be established. These are the groups who are in the forefront of bringing a New Constitution. A Sinhalese living in this country had never objected to anyone believing in any faith, the right of living in this country. There is only 38% of Tamil nationals living in the North, the rest are living in other parts of the country among the Sinhala people
Gotabhaya Rajapaksa also maintained that it is essential to explain in detail the contents included in the New Constitution. The TNA made several demands. They wanted us to demilitarize the areas in order to help them in conducting elections in a free manner. We did that. The requirements of ordinary Tamil people were more important that those of the separatists. Even during the war many Tamil students from the North continued their studies at the Ruhuna University without any interruption.(J A L Jayasinghe)

Only one sovereign legislature with subsidiary bodies: Jayampathi
	
Government MP Jayampathi Wickramaratne, who is playing a pivotal role in the constitution-making process said there would only be one sovereign and central legislative body in a unitary state and those proposed in the interim report were subordinate legislative bodies.
He said this during the debate on the constitution-making process and that in an ekiya rajya or unitary state as mentioned in the interim report what is proposed is to have several subsidiary legislative councils other than the central legislature.
Referring to a ruling given by the then Chief Justice Sharvananda, he said there could be more than subsidiary legislative bodies which were not sovereign in a unitary state and that position would be preserved in making the new Constitution. He said if the central legislature had the power to abolish the provincial councils, it was very clearly a unitary state.
"What is proposed is to have a number subsidiary legislative councils in addition to the central legislature. However these subsidiary legislative bodies will not be sovereign which the central legislature enjoys. Besides the central government will have the power to abolish a subsidiary legislative council as and when it becomes necessary," the MP said.
He stressed the need to avoid conflicts between the central and subsidiary councils and said
the government decided to make amendments to the constitution without a referendum only under the 100-day programme. "The Government clearly stated that it would go for a new constitution with the consent of the people through a referendum. Even President Maithripala Sirisena pledged to enact a new constitution through a referendum during the presidential election and renewed the pledge during the funeral of Ven. Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera who was also agitating for a new constitution. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwadana)

Sampath Bank has designed the Sanhinda Saver account from the ground up to specifically meet the needs of its esteemed customers who are over the age of 55. Account holders receive a higher rate of interest, with interest payments being made twice a month. Additional interest is paid for foreign currency (US$) savings accounts. The bank also offers them a host of deals and discounts at several leading hospitals, pharmacies, medical labs and other merchant partners.
Sampath Bank PLC Deposit Mobilization Assistant General Manager Sanath Abhayaratne said: At Sampath Bank, we take great pride in being a truly Sri Lankan financial service provider. We have always strived to live by the nations values and belief systems and incorporate them in everything we do. Inspired by our societys regards for elders and the tradition of caring for them when they get older, the Sampath Sanhinda Saver account is tailored to meet the unique needs of customers over the age of 50. It offers account holders a host of benefits and privileges that are aligned to their lifestyle. Thanking them for placing their trust in Sampath Bank, we are delighted to offer over Rs.100 million in medical benefits this year, the highest ever in our history.
Sampath Bank has also launched the Sanhinda Medical Benefit Card to enable Sanhinda Saver account holders avail their rewards and benefits with greater ease. Coming in place of the Sanhinda vouchers currently in use, the cards bring in greater convenience and security. Unlike the vouchers, account holders will now be able to pay out only the specific amount they need from the total value of benefits available in their card using the new Sanhinda Medical Benefit Card. While the cards will be valid for five years from the date of issue, the benefits being distributed currently are valid until 28th February 2018.
We are constantly looking for more ways in which we can add value to our customers and provide them with greater conveniences. The Sanhinda Medical Benefit Card will simplify the process of obtaining medical benefits and make the lives of our Sampath Sanhinda Saver account holders easier, allowing them to spend more time enjoying their golden years, said Sampath Bank PLC Marketing Head Nadi B.

Sybil Wettasinghe keeps the world young
	
Fifteen years ago, after interviewing this grand old lady, who is forever young, I called my wife and said, parana yaluvek hamba una (I met an old friend). Sybil, I added. She was thrilled. Neither of us had met her before. Years later, we would, along with our two daughters, but she was nevertheless an old friend, a part of our growing up and a part of the growing up of our daughters. 
And we are not alone. Shes been the aunt thousands have never met, but who nevertheless were touched by her. Shes given us all joy and laughter, magic and nostalgia. Most important, she breathes life into that creature called Child Within that everything in life seems determined to destroy. 

How can someone write what is in word and illustration quintessentially Sinhala and yet have it resonate in someone to whom Sinhala and Sri Lanka are absolutely foreign
It had been the then Head Master of Royal Primary, H.D. Sugathapala, who first commissioned her to illustrate Nava Maga Standard 5 Reader after seeing some of her drawings at an exhibiton at the Art Gallery submitted by her father. Martin Wickramasinghe had recognized her potential and this paved the way for a job at Lankadeepa. Then she got to illustrate folk poems every Saturday and still later to illustrate Sooty Bandas articles and short stories for The Times. She subsequently joined Lake House where she got to illustrate an entire page.

A penchant for story-telling
The Editor of Janatha, Denzil Peiris, having discovered that Sybil had a penchant for story-telling following a chance opportunity courtesy a co-worker falling ill, got her to write. She wrote Kuda Hora (Umbrella Thief), a story that has since been published in 13 countries. 
Shes come a long way since then. One could also say, shes not moved, that shes been where she was and who she was through all these years. Her story is not an article. It is a book and the part of it that she wrote (until the mid-nineties) won her the Gratiaen Award in 1995 (The Child in me). Her story is a thesis. It is a history of literature for children, a handbook for the aspiring writer and illustrator and a trace of the nations cultural sensibility. 

Sybil described, describes and will continue to describe the world in ways that are unforgettable. She informed, informs and will continue to inform that theres so much delight to be obtained from ordinary things.
How can a single story delight children across time How can a single story-teller continue to delight an individual with childrens stories long after that individual has moved from child to adult It has to be someone who is in touch with the earth, its creatures and processes, someone who knows intimately the secrets of the sensibilities of her social context, is rooted in cultural soils and can at will stretch out arms and embrace the universe. Thats Sybil.
How can someone write what is in word and illustration quintessentially Sinhala and yet have it resonate in someone to whom Sinhala and Sri Lanka are absolutely foreign Such a person must know intimately the secrets of the human condition and its most salient commonalities. Thats also Sybil. 
Love of ordinary things
Sybil described, describes and will continue to describe the world in ways that are unforgettable. She informed, informs and will continue to inform that theres so much delight to be obtained from ordinary things. She has given the humble a form and opened eyes to recognize it in ourselves and our fellow creatures. 
When I was a child, the world around me seemed a more fresh, nicer and a more beautiful place. This is why my childhood, in my rustic village home, seems to me, a long, beautiful dream. Then people seemed to live as warmhearted human beings giving out love and affection, caring for one another with a kindred togetherness. Enchanting recollections from those days keep pouring out of my heart, mingled with love towards all those lovable country folk.
Secret behind her beauty
Thats a nostalgic statement anyone can make. Sybil Wettasinghe doesnt stop there whereas most would. She adds this: It is an experience too precious to be kept within. 
There are those among us who want to share. And then there are those who can. Sybil Wettasinghe falls into the latter category. 
She is or rather her work is probably among earliest memories for thousands of people. Her words dont age. Her illustrations dont fade. 

Shes come a long way since then. One could also say, shes not moved, that shes been where she was and who she was through all these years. Her story is not an article. It is a book
The last time I visited her she took me to her work station. Her drawing book was full of ink marks. There were names, numbers and notes, all laid out neatly. 
She loves this room. She loves the way the sunlight streams into the room in the evening. She said something which was simple, profound and unforgettable, much like most of her work: When I am alone I become my friend and I feel so beautiful! 
At 90 she is still as full of wonderment as she had been when she was a child and the world seemed more fresh, nicer and a more beautiful place. 
She wrote and illustrated childrens stories. In doing so she showed pathways to childhood and wonderment that are not forbidden to anyone, regardless of age, location or cultural histories. She keeps the world young and that perhaps is the secret of her enduring youthfulness.

## Title: The 500th Anniversary of the Reformation

The 500th Anniversary of the Reformation
	
There are three special Reformations in History. The 1st is where Jesus changed history from the life styled by the Law of Moses to the life styled by Christianity in AD 33. The 2nd was when Emperor Constantine changed history from the Roman-styled life to the Christian-styled life in AD 325 and the 3rd was when Martin Luther an Augustinian Monk changed History from the dark ages of Christianity to todays World of Christianity by posting 95 theses on a Wittenberg church door in Germany initiating this Reformation. It is this 3rd Reformation which will mark 500 years on Oct 31, 2017.  
In simpler days, everyone understood how to react to such anniversaries. Protestants would celebrate the German Hercules cleaning out the dark ages of the church, restoring the primacy of Scripture, and bringing to light the Word of God ,  Verbum Dei, the Gospel of salvation by Grace alone, through Faith alone & on account of Christ alone. While the Romans Catholics would denounce the Protestants as a revolt against the godly authority, a rejection of orthodoxy that channelled millions of souls away from the gates of hell. This year however is different, and not simply because the anniversary marks a nice round 500 years. But because we dont think as did some of our ignorant ancestors thought it noble to say that somebodys theology is defective. Both churches held to the ideology YOUR THEOLOGY IS WRONG AND ONLY OURS IS RIGHT . Similar to the days when both the UNP & SLFP politicians said Our democratic policy is correct and yours is not.  The Good Governance seems to have changed this to some extent. and so have the bitter lessons of the past brought these two opponents -- the Lutherans and the Roman Catholics closer this on this 500th Anniversary of the Reformation.
But the latter has of late tended to less highlight the theological errors introduced with the Reformation. Needless to say, Protestants and Catholics have had a rocky Adi Pudi past. At present Pope Francis himself has said Lutherans, Catholics and Protestants and all of us agree on the doctrine of justification. On this point, which is very important, he [Luther] did not err. 
The Roman Church has been extremely silent and applied both hand brakes & foot brakes on what we heard a few decades ago  EXTRA ECCLESIA NULLE SALVE ( Outside the Church there is no Salvation.) Broadly speaking, the tone & music have definitely changed. Lets get together yehyehyeh and We are one in Spirit. We are one in the Lord & They will know we are Christians.
At St. Catherines Catholic Church, Ontario, Canada, on certain Sundays of the month the preacher is a Lutheran Minister. In 1987 when I said a Sunday Mass on War Ship, Deutscheland, I did not know that the one who concelebrated with me , Chap. Rolf, was a Lutheran Chaplain. After the service 3 German Sailors objected to what had taken place. I personally dont think there would be such objections in the future.
If the reformation did not take place would there be only one church all these 500 years  After the Reformation we see that even though Luther did not intend to cause any division the inevitable took place not just a division into 2 but into 4,6,8 etc. The Lutherans were followed by the Zwinglians, Calvinists, Knoxian, Westminstrians, Weslians, Concordians, Carians and more recently the Charismatics. The Bible Society reported that there are over 500 divisions in Sri Lanka alone. These divisions were not like the atomic divisions right to subatomic parts & quarts. But on a policy in which each founder stated My interpretation is right & yours isnt. Whose now going to take the blame
St. Augustine the lawyer, AD 354-AD 431, appearing for his clients in Latin, Greek, Hebrew and in the unwritten jargon of his locality was an intellectual giant who was not only able to dig deep into the Biblical works of Attorney St Paul but also able to comprehend its profound teachings and being a master lawyer was efficient in systematically classifying them into theological volumes for his students. Attorney Martin Luther 1483-1546, 1500 years later entering an Augustinian Monastery in Wittenberg Germany confronted these volumes and being an intellectual giant like his founder St Augustine went a step further by simplifying these volumes into a Systematic Catechism for the simple folk in Germany. So this is how the simple people for the first time got to understand what God had said till then it remained only with the high ups.
Today Pastors jump at the idea to come to the east to bank their big western salaries, $10,000 or $20,000, here and live like kings owing to the massive exchange rate and keep praising God for Augustinian Luthers Doctrine of Predestination that has gifted them Luxurious lives here on earth even before going to heaven. This is an evil of the Reformation when one glances at how penniless Saints Joseph Vaz and Jerome Gonzalvez went about this island. Some foreign protestant missionaries however as authentic Christians do reach out to poor Sri Lankans keeping them free from starvation & poverty. Attorney Augustine the master is a Doctor of the Church to the Roman Catholics while Attorney Martin Luther, his student, is the hero to the Protestants. May this 500th Anniversary of the Reformation reduce the gap between us Christians year by year towards unity, we pray. Amen.
