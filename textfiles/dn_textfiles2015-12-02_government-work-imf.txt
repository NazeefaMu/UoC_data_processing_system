Countering effects of Middle East economic instability
Government to work with IMF

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe instructed Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake to work with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a standby programme to face possible impacts on Sri Lankan economy in view of the economic instability in the Middle East region.
The Prime Minister said in Parliament joining the second reading debate on the budget proposal that owing to the activities of the ISIS, there could be an economic instability in the Middle Eastern region which could affect the Sri Lanka economy.
"I instructed the Finance Minister to go for a standby Programme with the IMF to face possible economic instability. Economic growth rates of all countries except for the US have slowed down and Sri Lanka too has felt their effect," the Prime Minister said.
He said the daily income of 43 percent of Sri Lanka's population is less than two US dollars. He said it is essential to help the poor to enjoy the dividends of the economic development.
"We are on the threshold of a new journey. The budget proposals have been designed to facilitate our journey forward. But there are some of those who are not willing to see a change to a new political tradition," he said.
"This unwillingness to change in the minds of some quarters was visible in the reactions when the President presented the policy speech of the government on September 1, when I presented mid-term economic policy on November 5 and when the Finance Minister presented budget proposals on November 20," the Prime Minister said.
