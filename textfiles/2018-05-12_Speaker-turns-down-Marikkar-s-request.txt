Speaker Karu Jayasuriya yesterday turned down a request by UNP MP S.M. Marikkar for an investigation against former deputy speaker Thilanga Sumathipala alleging that he had used Parliament property for political work.

“There is an allegation that Mr. Sumathipala had used his official vehicles for political work, during his tenure Deputy Speaker," the Speaker said and added that however, Mr. Sumathipala had handed over the vehicles and other properties he used when he was deputy speaker.

“As such I cannot conduct investigations into what happened in the past,” he said. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)
