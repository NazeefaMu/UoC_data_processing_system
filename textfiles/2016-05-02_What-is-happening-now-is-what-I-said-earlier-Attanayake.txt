Former General Secretary of the UNP Tissa Attanayake said what is now happening in the North is what he had said earlier and which were not accepted by some.

Speaking to media personnel on last Saturday morning after visiting the newly appointed chief prelate of the Asgiriya chapter the Most Venerable Sastrapathi Warakagoda Gnanarathana Thera, and obtaining his blessings, he said that the Northern Provincial Council had made certain proposals and after adopting them had sought international assistance, which had been flatly declined by the foreign delegates.

He also said that he worked with the UNP for thirty years, and hope to launch his party soon.

“Some of the things that are taking place now, I had foreseen but they were not accepted and I was taken into custody for no fault of mine and was subjected to harassment, which I endured ungrudgingly. I can now state emphatically that what I’ve stated is comparatively similar to what is happening now,” he said further.

He stated people of our country had much hopes when they brought this government into power, but now they are faced with certain issues, even the workers too are now confronted with issues, Attanayake said.

When asked about his future plans, Attanayake stated that he has his own political party and that he had not attempted to spread it islandwide and he would do so at the correct time. (J.A.L. Jayasinghe)
