What’s sauce for the goose is not sauce for the gander


	



 

A certain purohita of the previous regime was appointed by a political lackey of his as a director of an important statutory body that came under his purview.

 


The appointment given was a palpably illegal one for there was no provision made for the post in question. This worthy possessed no qualifications for a high office either. So it was a case of abusing public funds to pay a big monthly salary and provide perks like a vehicle and free fuel to the holder of public office sans legal validity.    


This illegal appointment which constitutes a financial crime is now being inquired into by a high-powered commission appointed by yahapalanaya. This story so far should come as no surprise to anyone.


Now comes the part of the story that could amaze even the worldly-wise.


The political henchman, whose illegal appointment is now being investigated, has been re-appointed as a director of the same statutory board by yahapalanaya.  This worthy who was a favourite of the previous regime had managed to become a favourite of yahapalanaya overnight, they say.


The lucky director hails from a township located over 100 kilometres away from Colombo and he is seldom seen at his desk, say the employees.
