Hatton National Bank PLC (HNB) launched its brand-new website recently. The new site, which targets both individual and corporate customers, was designed to become a benchmark amongst websites in the banking sector. 
The HNB website epitomizing user-friendliness was designed to help visitors find the information they want as quickly and easily as possible, presenting the most sought-after information and tools upfront and helping users quickly filter to find the content most relevant to their needs. Information is provided in an easy-to-skim manner so users can grasp key points quickly in a clutter-free environment. Users also have the option of downloading applications, contacting the bank through the mode of their choice, or saving information to view later. 
The new website designed and developed with Affno (Pvt.) Ltd is focusing on today’s tech-ready audience, the website is mobile-responsive, adapting to all manner of mobile and tablet devices. This gives users the benefit of loan calculators, maps, ATM and branch locators and all other features on their mobiles.
HNB Head of Marketing Chammika Weerasinghe commented, “HNB is one of Sri Lanka’s most visited banking websites and it’s therefore essential that it connects with consumers to give them greater control and access to information so they can make informed financial decisions which suit their needs. The new site with its mobile optimization will make each visit/interaction by any individual closer to a sale and a rewarding banking experience. 
Affno CEO Suren Kannangara commenting on the launch, said, “Affno has been partnering with HNB for over seven years, and it is a relationship we cherish. The site is built on the latest technologies and designed to provide the optimal user experience for HNB clients.”
Apart from its intuitive and feature-rich interface, the website uses the latest web trends to project HNB’s passion for innovation and transformation of banking in Sri Lanka. Making the site particularly engaging and mobile friendly, the design uses parallax scrolling and allows users to view all information on a product simply by swiping rather than navigating to several pages.
HNB’s vision doesn’t stop there – this is only the first step in the bank’s web strategy. Further value additions are set to follow (including social sign-in and a card reward finder), creating new avenues for individuals and corporations to interact and engage with the bank.
The website can be accessed by logging onto www.hnb.net.
