They are set to take the city!


	



 

The JO is reportedly set to capture the city council at the local polls expected by the year-end.

 


The JO stalwarts had at the very outset decided that their mayoral candidate should be a prominent public figure from a minority community. While looking for a formidable candidate with the necessary qualifications, their focus had come to rest on a lady of an outstanding Muslim political family. 


The city council had been the launching pad of her husband’s successful political career as well.
The former strongman has already informally invited the lady to take over leadership of the JO group due to enter the fray, but a positive response is yet to come.


However, the former strongman is quite confident that she will give her nod in due course, informed 
sources say.
