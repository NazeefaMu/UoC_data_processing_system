REUTERS, 16th APRIL, 2017 - Pope Francis,  leading the world’s Roman Catholics into Easter, urged them on Saturday  not to ignore the plight of immigrants, the poor and other vulnerable  people.

In his homily at an  Easter Vigil Mass in St. Peter’s Basilica, Francis recounted the  Biblical account of Jesus Christ’s mother Mary and Mary Magdalene,  filled with grief, as they went to visit his tomb following the  crucifixion.

Their grief, he said during the solemn ceremony, could be seen in the faces of many women today.
“In  their faces we can see reflected all those who, walking the streets of  our cities, feel the pain of dire poverty, the sorrow born of  exploitation and human trafficking,” he said.

“We  can also see the faces of those who are greeted with contempt because  they are immigrants, deprived of country, house and family. We see faces  whose eyes bespeak loneliness and abandonment, because their hands are  creased with wrinkles.”
