Thirteen kilogrammes of heroin (brown sugar) said to be the largest haul in the Grandpass area, were seized by the Police Narcotics Bureau this evening during a search operation carried out to find firearms in the area, Police spokesman Priyantha Jayakody said.

He said the heroin haul was found hidden inside the baggage of a 37-year-old person at Nagalagam Street.

“The suspect was inspected during the operation carried out to search for firearms. This was the largest heroin haul seized from the Grandpass area,” he said.

After the purity test found it to be pure brown sugar, police said the heroin haul probably carried a street value of about Rs.800 million.

He said during the investigations, police had found local currency worth nearly Rs.3 million from the location where the heroin haul was found.

He said the Police investigations had revealed that this was part of a well organized heroin racket and the police are still inspecting a luxury house and the area for suspicious narcotics and firearms.

“Further investigations revealed the heroin haul was brought to the location in a car. A team of police officers was deployed to investigate the car and the detection of the heroin haul. Another special team was appointed to carry out further investigations based on CCTV footage in the area,” DIG Jayakody said.

The raid and the investigation were carried out under the instructions of the Police Narcotic Bureau (PNB) Colombo North SSP Lionel Gunathilaka and the Grandpass police OIC Nimal Shantha. The raid was carried out by a team headed by the Police Sub Inspector Laksiri. (Chaturanga Pradeep)
