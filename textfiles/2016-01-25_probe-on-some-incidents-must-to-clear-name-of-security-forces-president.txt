A probe on a few incidents has become essential in order to prevent the world from naming the Sri Lankan security forces as an unlawful force, President Maithripala Sirisena said today.
“Such a probe on a few incidents is essential to save our security forces from being outlawed by the world,” President Sirisena said during the launch of the 'Virusara’ privilege card for security forces at Temple Trees this afternoon.
However, President Sirisena said no probe would target the security forces as the only objective would be to know the truth.
He questioned whether those who opposed a probe and accused the government of betraying the nation were waiting till Sri Lanka was isolated by the world. He said this while highlighting that Sri Lanka was bound by the international covenants’ to safeguard the rights of people and treat them equally.
Stating that some had started to talk about blood, the President said those who did that should realize that human blood is same irrespective of what ethnic or religious group a person belonged to and irrespective of the language they spoke.
The President said a mudslinging campaign was being carried out by some in the social media and some have even suggested that he and the Prime Minister should be broken into pieces. However he said they could not be silenced by these campaigns. “We will do our duty amidst mudslinging and death threats,” he said.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremeisnghe who was expected to participate in the ceremony was a notable absentee.
Meanwhile, State Minister of Defence Ruwan Wijewardene addressing the ceremony said the government would bestow the topmost status to the security forces, the police and members of Civil Defence Forces.
He said the allegation made by some that the government was neglecting the country’s security and the sovereignty was totally baseless and false claim. “We will not do anything to jeopardize the security and sovereignty of our motherland,” he said.
Mr. Wijewardene said the decision of the government to introduce a privilege card scheme for the security forces, police and the members of the Civil Defense forces was to enhance their status.
“We will never forget the security forces personnel who sacrificed their lives for the country, those who became physically challenged and their families. That’s why we have introduced this system,” he added. (Yohan Perera)
