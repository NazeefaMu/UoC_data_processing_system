No cheaper meals


	

A government Diyawanna member is said to have got highly upset over the recent hike in the food prices at the Diyawanna council canteen. 



He had gone to the council canteen for his lunch the other day along with two political buddies as usual. As they sat down to their lunch, a canteen employee had told the government politico, “Sir, today’s lunch will cost you more!” “Why do you say so?” the politico had expressed his surprise.

“The prices of all items on our menus are now increased!” “Now just tell me in simple language what our meals will cost beginning from today!” “The breakfast will cost you Rs.60 and the lunch Rs.200!” The politico looked hard at his two buddies and said: “So that’s the end of our cheap meals here!”
