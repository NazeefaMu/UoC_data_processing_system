Suffering setbacks in political battles


	



 

The politico-turned-general despite the happy turn of fortune since yahapalanaya taking office had not been happy with his lot thereafter too. His complaint had always been that he had not been assigned a subject he was best suited for.

 

His disgust took a turn for the worse when he was denied the much-coveted law and order portfolio after giving him the hope of getting it at the reshuffle before the latest one. A person never used to hiding his feelings or keeping his tongue tied, the general in interviews with media later slammed Number One for cheating him.On the eve of the latest reshuffle, the general had approached Number Two and had told him, “Sir, please assign the law and order subject to me at least at this reshuffle!”


After mulling over the request for a minute or two, Number Two had replied: “Now look! Not even two months have passed since this subject being given to that chap. Isn’t it too early to change it? Please wait…”So, the general had to go back empty-handed.  However, he had the consolation of being given another subject at the swearing-in held the following day.
