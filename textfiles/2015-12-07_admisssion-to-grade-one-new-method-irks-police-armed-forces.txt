Members of the police and armed forces disapprove of changes made by the Education Department regarding the admission of children to grade one of popular schools.
The former practice was to reserve seven places, for children of police and armed forces personnel, in grade one of each school.
There were three places for children of army personnel, two for the children of police personnel and one each for children of navy and air force personnel.
The total number places in each class has been reduced to five: with two for the army, and one each for the police, air force and navy.
Parents who were hoping to admit their children to popular schools are disappointed.
The affected parents have appealed to the Minister to restore the former quota.
