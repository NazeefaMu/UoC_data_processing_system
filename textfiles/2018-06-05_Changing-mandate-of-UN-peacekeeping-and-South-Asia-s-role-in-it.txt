Changing mandate of UN peacekeeping and South Asia’s role in it


	



The UN Peacekeeping Force (UNPKF for short) came into being during the Arab-Israeli war in 1948. Subsequently, in 1988, by dint of its immense contribution to the maintenance of peace in trouble spots across the world, it bagged the Nobel Peace Prize from the Norwegian Nobel Committee.  


 “The Peacekeeping Forces of the United Nations have, under extremely difficult conditions, contributed to reducing tensions where an armistice has been negotiated but a peace treaty has yet to be established. In situations of this kind, the UN forces represent the manifest will of the community of nations to achieve peace through negotiations, and the forces have, by their presence, made a decisive contribution towards the initiation of actual peace negotiations,” the Norwegian Nobel Peace Prize Committee said on its decision to give the award to UNPKF.   


Since 1948, the UNPKF has been involved in 71 UN operations, 57 of them since 1988. Today, a little more than 110,000 military, police and civilian staff serve in 14 peacekeeping missions.   


So far, more than 3326 peacekeepers from 120 countries have laid down their lives in the cause of peace on behalf of the UN. However, there has been a decrease in both personnel and peacekeeping missions recently, as a result of peaceful transitions and the redevelopment of troubled States .   

Role changes with contextual changes 


The context for UN peacekeeping missions had changed dramatically after the end of the US-USSR Cold War in the 1990s.  


This is what a UN document says about the new context and role of the UNPKF: The UN shifted and expanded its field operations from traditional missions involving “observational tasks” performed by military personnel to complex “multidimensional” enterprises.  


“These multidimensional missions were designed to ensure the implementation of comprehensive peace agreements and assist in laying the foundations for sustainable peace.”  


“The nature of conflicts also changed over the years. UN Peacekeeping, originally developed as a means of dealing with inter-State conflict, was increasingly being applied to intra-State conflicts and civil wars.”  


“UN Peacekeepers are now increasingly asked to undertake a wide variety of complex tasks, from helping to build sustainable institutions of governance, to human rights monitoring, to security sector reform, to the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration of former combatants.”   


However, the military has remained the UNPKF’s backbone and its main instrument. But the military’s main tasks now include: administration; economic advice; policing; legal advice; de-mining; electoral monitoring; human rights monitoring; humanitarian aid; and advice on governance.   


After the Cold War ended, there was a rapid increase in the number of peacekeeping operations. Between 1989 and 1994, there were 20 new operations involving 11,000 to 75,000 peacekeepers.  


There were peacekeeping operations in Angola, Cambodia and Namibia, to implement complex peace agreements; stabilize the security situation; re-organize the military and police; elect new governments and build democratic institutions. And of course there were military operations in former Yugoslavia and Somalia. 

 


For instance, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nepal together contributed over 30% of the total number of UN peacekeepers worldwide in 2014. Western states by comparison contributed a mere five percent. But US is the single largest donor accounting for 28% of financial contributions    


Setbacks and reforms


However, there were setbacks in the early 1990s which led to an inquiry into the operations in Rwanda, Srebrenica and Somalia. The UNPKF was withdrawn from Somalia.   


But in the second half of 1990s, new operations were approved in Angola, Bosnia-Herzegovina, and Croatia, Macedonia, Guatemala and Haiti.  


In 1999 the UN served as the administrator of both Kosovo in the former Yugoslavia, and in East Timor (now Timor-Leste), which broke away from Indonesia. Later, the UNPKF was sent to Burundi, Chad, Central African Republic, Ivory Coast, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eritrea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, South Sudan, Darfur and Syria.  


Many of these operations have now completed their mandates as in Central African Republic, Chad, Democratic Republic of Congo, Burundi and Sierra Leone, Eritrea and Ivory Coast.  


But multi-tasking is the order of the day. Today the UNPKF’s role is truly multidimensional. They assist in civilian care, demobilization and re-integration, electoral processes and ensuring human rights and Rule of Law.  

Troops mostly from poorer countries 


A closer look at UN peacekeeping reveals that troops from relatively poor, populous countries - mostly from Africa and South Asia - account for a huge proportion of the peacekeeping forces worldwide.   


For instance, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nepal together contributed over 30% of the total number of UN peacekeepers worldwide in 2014. Western states by comparison contributed a mere five percent. But US is the single largest donor accounting for 28% of financial contributions   


There are several reasons for the greater participation of South Asian nations in the UNPKF. One is emoluments. An average soldier here would earn about US$ 200 per month but in the UNPKF he would earn US$ 1,000.  


Personnel from these countries learn to use new technology and get experience of working with personnel from other armies, learn new languages all of which help in furthering their careers. Last but not the least, South Asia barring Sri Lanka, has traditionally had surplus military manpower and had supplied troops to the colonial powers from the 16th.Century onwards.   


This was so until the end of World War II in 1945.  

From cultures of compassion


According to the Bangladesh High Commissioner in Sri Lanka, Riaz Hamidullah, troops from the South Asian countries are ideal for peacekeeping operations for a cultural reason.   


Explaining the success of the Bangladeshi personnel in the UNPKF,Hamidullah said that the conduct of the Bangladeshi peacekeepers stems from their native culture nurtured over centuries.   


“It is founded on an innate South Asian propensity to show compassion beyond the call of duty and to share what little one has with one’s fellow beings,” the envoy said.  


He went on to give an example from a troubled and indigent African country in which the Bangladeshi peace keepers shared their rations with the starving population around their camps.   


“It was all beyond the rule book. In another case of creative magnanimity, seeds of an edible plant which had been brought down from Bangladesh for the troops’ consumption, were distributed by the troops to the people around so that they could cultivate the crop. And the population did,” Hamidullah recalled.  


“The Bangladeshi peace keepers not only maintain law and order but also sow the seeds of friendship,” he said.

Bangladeshi engineers serving with the UN mission in South Sudan are leading efforts to improve a 78-km stretch of road between Gumbo and Mangalla, on the artery between Juba and Bor. The road connects local communities, allowing them to more easily bring goods to the market.  


In the last three decades, as many as 150,647 Bangladeshi peacekeepers, from the armed forces and the police, have worked in 54 UN missions in 40 countries. Of them, 135 have sacrificed their lives to establish peace, with more than 200 others suffering injuries.   


Currently, some 7,636 Bangladeshi peacekeepers, comprising 6,636 from the armed forces and the rest from police, are working in UN missions, according to UN peacekeeping statistics up to August 31, 2017. Bangladesh now accounts for 6.5% of the total UN peacekeeping force across the world.
