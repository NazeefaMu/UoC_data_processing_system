The last bastion of Human Rights


	



 

Human Rights Defenders(HRDs) are prosecuted worldwide for their activism. According to FORUM-ASIA 24 HRDs have lost their lives in the past year alone, while more than 362 cases of violation and abuses have been recorded. 


The 7th Asian Regional Human Rights Defenders Forum (AHRDF7) was held in Colombo recently. The forum, which meets once in two years focuses on reviewing human rights violations and coming up with more effective mechanisms to protect HRDs. 


The theme of the conference was ‘Towards Effective Protection for Human Rights Defenders/Women Human Rights Defenders: Self Reflection and Moving Forward.’


Human rights activists in Sri Lanka point out that enabling the forum to be held in Sri Lanka this year was a positive sign in the progression of promoting and protecting human rights and HRDs. 


However, they also voiced concern about certain violations and issues HRDs have started facing in the present regime.


Challenges faced by HRDs
In a statement they said though threats and interrogations have reduced since 2015, government forces have occasionally discredited NGOs and obstructed the media from covering certain court proceedings and events.


It further notes that protests have been obstructed and protesters have been arrested. The statement raised further concern about HRDs who have been questioned on the field or at the airport.  The statement highlights that there is slow progress ‘in ending impunity by investigating and bringing perpetrators to justice for acts of killing, disappearances and attacks on HRDs.’


Abductions
Arulvathana Sunthararaj, Programme officer ( legal aid) , centre of Human Rights and Development (CHRD) spoke on how the past abductions of persons, during and post the war, is still an unresolved issue as at today.


 “As a Human Rights Defender ( HRD) you need confidence in this field and I am happy that this forum has given us this confidence,” she said.


“I have been a Human Rights Officer for the past seven years and I have helped people with cases regarding land rights and missing persons. I was a school teacher, but since my husband’s disappearance in 2009 I became involved in HR activities. 


“Though my husband was abducted I prefer the term arrest, because the people who took him away were in uniform. No one should ever face such horrors in the future. Happy families have been broken, particularly in the North because of abductions. However courageous we are as women, when such atrocities occur it breaks us.”


She also spoke about her activities as a HRs activist“ I have helped many women whose husbands have been abducted. But, sometimes I feel helpless because I am not able to give them what they really want. Counseling is given to such victims, but reparations must be made. The victims have been educated about the OMP (Office of Missing Persons), but there is only so much that the OMP can deliver. 


“Many questions still buzz around our heads: When will truth and justice be delivered? Who will find the truth? The Police? Can we trust the Police? Many of us have lost faith in the Police. I have been making demands to the government through my organization, asking them to reveal the truth of about these abductions. But the government does not show much interest towards our dilemma.”

 


Laws delay
She also said that many cases regarding missing persons are delayed. She said, “ In most instances judges transfer the case. We want the government to look into this issue with interest. We sometimes wonder if the cases are dragged on by purpose. We still don’t know if the people who are missing have died or if they are detained. No one understands how we suffer sitting in the dark.”

 


Acquisition of lands
Chinthaka Pradeep, the Moderator of National Land and Agricultural Reforms said that the conference looked at systematic approaches in dealing with challenges faced by HRDs. 


“For a period of 10 years prior to 2015 there was no conducive environment in the country for HRDs to function. At the conference we spoke lengthily about how we can establish this liberty we’ve achieved.” He also expressed doubt as to whether the condition in the country was transforming back to the time of suppression. 


“There is a threat brewing against small scale producers such as farmers, estate workers, people in the North. Our challenge is to work with these people who have been threatened.”  In this respect, he said, that it was necessary to challenge programmes by the government. 
“The issue of our safety resurfaces here.”


“The budget proposals and other economic development plans by the government show their inclination to acquire large scales of lands used by small scale producers for their livelihood and hand them to their trading companies. This has brought about a threat of dispossession of lands,” he added expressing the need to organize and empower people to stand against such challenges and protect their rights.”


Are HRDs safe ?
Arulvathana Sunthararaj said that a more conducive environment has to be created for HRDs to feel safe.


“I was initially extremely scared to get into this field, because when I was beginning to get involved in 2009, it was a volatile time for HR activists. But, now it is much safer to get involved, but still HR activists have to keep a rather low profile. 


“We are working with the love for humanity, and for us to do our best we need to work in harmony with the government. Female HR activists are still being harassed in the North, but in Colombo we are much safer. 


“However, many of the HR’s problems are outside Colombo and we must take care of people who are at the grass root level. We are all citizens of this country and thus government officers are all responsible for us. My last request is that we must stand strong for the victims whose HRs have been infringed.”
