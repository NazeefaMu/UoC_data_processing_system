EU court rejects argument that LTTE didn’t engage in 'terrorist acts'


	

The European Court of Justice (ECJ) on Tuesday has rejected an argument by the LTTE requesting that their activities not be classified as "terrorist acts."

According to an article published on JURIST’s website, the arguments were proffered as support for four individuals who had their assets frozen due to the accusation that they were financing acts of terror by financing the Tamil Tigers.

The court ruled the move was acceptable, holding that the acts of the Tamil Tigers were admissible as terrorist acts.

Terror Lists have come under fire in recent years for violating the basic human rights of those affected by the blacklisting.

Meanwhile, the New Zealand Herald reported that four people in the Netherlands had their assets frozen. It was argued the group's activities, as an armed force in a civil war, were governed by international humanitarian law and not international anti-terrorism rules.

The court found international law "does not prevent actions by armed forces during periods of armed conflict from constituting 'terrorist acts.'"

Last year ECJ Advocate General Eleanor Sharpston released two opinions arguing that Hamas and the LTTE should be removed from the EU's Terror List.
