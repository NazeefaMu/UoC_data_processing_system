With the increasing number of Chinese tourists coming to Sri Lanka, more and more local merchants have signed up to accept UnionPay cards to provide more convenience through the additional payment option and to attract more new customers.  
UnionPay is the preferred payment brand for Chinese tourists.  According to the international research company A.C. Nielsen, 100 percent of Chinese nationals are familiar with the UnionPay brand.  
Merchants choose to say ‘yes’ to UnionPay is saying ‘yes’ to increased business opportunities.  With more than 5 billion cards issued globally, UnionPay has one of the world’s largest cardholder base.   To help boost business prospect for local merchants, UnionPay is launching more marketing promotions throughout the year.  As an example, the World Duty Free store at the Colombo Bandaranaike International airport has recently offered an exclusive discount to the UnionPay cardholders.
From cardholders’ viewpoint, they can save up to 2% in each transaction (compared with other popular card brands) as UnionPay waives the Overseas Transaction Handling (OTH) fee.  So, there is more incentive for the cardholders to spend more in Sri Lanka.
Derek Chang, Head of South Asia of UnionPay said “We see Sri Lanka as one of the important markets for UnionPay as Sri Lanka is a preferred destination among our cardholders including the Chinese travelers. 
We believe promotion like the one we have at the World Duty Free store will further enhance the level of card member satisfaction, and at the same time, helping local merchants to do more business.”
