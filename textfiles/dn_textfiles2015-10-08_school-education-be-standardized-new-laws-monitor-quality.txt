School education to be standardized: New laws to monitor quality

In a fresh attempt to regulate the booming education business in the country, the Ministry of Education plans to introduce new laws to monitor the quality of international schools.
Initially the ministry will focus on the quality of education provided by international schools, focusing on curricular, quality of teachers and school facilities, Ministry Secretary W. M. Bandusena said.
Since the establishment of the first international school in 1977, the institutes have been operating in a vacuum, with no authority to govern or monitor them. Registered under Companies Act as a business entity or as BOI projects, international schools started multiplying across the country during the last two decades.
Last week Education Minister Akila Kariyawasam renewed his promise to regulate the sector. This was also included in the 100-day plan in the presidential campaign as well. But this is not the first time to attempt imposing regulations on international schools.
In 2013, then Education Minister Bandula Gunawardene attempted regulating the schools. Before him, the National Education Commission report given by Prof. G. D. Gunwardne recommended the same. But none yielded results.
Until this year Education Ministry officials had little knowledge regarding international schools. In March, for the first time, the ministry commenced collecting data on schools, including the number of students, teachers and the subjects taught. Accordingly, international and private schools both teaching local and foreign syllabuses to students between the ages of 5 and 18 were to provide details to the ministry. "It is our responsibility to ensure that all students of this county get a quality education and we are just acting on our duty," Bandusena claimed.
However, he was unable to provide details of the specifics of the monitoring mechanism that is being proposed to maintain quality standards of education services offered by international schools.
The move is a welcome change in the right direction, Buddhika Fernando, father of three school- going children claimed. With three children still receiving primary education in a leading international school in Colombo, expenses are high. But not the standard of education given, he claims.
"I put on my 'Mr. Angry face' and marched into the school when I realized that my children are not getting a satisfactory education. That was not the first time that I had to enter the school premises to inquire about the education system," he says.

He was concerned that the school employed unqualified teachers, and lacked quality in the education imparted on students.
"The charges of the school increased day by day, but the teachers at the schools are not well qualified. Sometimes the administration recruits school leavers too. Nearly 98 percent of teachers in the government schools are trained teachers and that is an advantage in those schools," he said.
When he understood the shortcomings, he considered changing the school. But the expenses involved in such a move were prohibitive, he claims.
The quality of education was a concern for Perera too, who declined to be identified by her full name. A teacher by profession, she claims she sees a marked difference in the education her two sons receive. One of her sons attends an international school, the other a state school.
"Acquiring a good English language skill is the only advantage in sending your child to an international school. The school administration needs to show some concern over the quality of teachers. There is no stability either. Teachers do not stay for long periods in the school. They leave the school for better job opportunities. It is not the same in government schools," she claims.
Added to the quality concerns, Fernando claims that the administration did not deliver all the services he was promised when admitting his children to the school.
"When I admitted them to the school, the administration promised to provide free transport. With the term fee we were asked to pay facilities fee which included both transport and recreation fees. But after a year, suddenly they included a separate transport fee and now I have to pay more than Rs. 65,000 for term fees per child".
With no authority to safeguard the interests of the students, Fernando has no one to turn to. However, not all are in favour of the ministry decision.
Calling the ministry decision a move to privatize education, General Secretary of the Ceylon Teachers Union Joseph Stalin claimed that the government should take steps to take over all international school.
Stalin also questioned the legal capacity of the education ministry to impose regulations when the institutions registered as business entities fall outside the purview of the education ministry.
"Many of these small international schools don't even have proper facilities. Some function as mobile schools. When the lease period of the building in which the school is run expires, they move. All of these should be taken over by the ministry," he demanded.
International Schools of Sri Lanka (TISSL) association Chairman Dr. Harsha Alles expressed his willingness to cooperate with the government to regulate the sector.
However, the association is yet to be consulted by the ministry.
"We need to know the regulations that the ministry is planning to impose. The previous year, the ministry recommended us to teach the mother tongue (Sinhala and Tamil), History of Sri Lanka and Religion. All 25 member schools will be implementing the recommendation to the curriculum and it functions from September 2015," he said.
Although international schools provide education to over 40,000 students, unlike private schools their institutions receive no support from the government, he claimed.
Stressing on the need to take all aspects of the issue into account, Dr. Alles said the future of all students studying in international schools should be taken into consideration before regulations are made.
