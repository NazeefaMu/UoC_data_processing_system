Hellibees Racing excel at Pannala Circuit Meet

November 14 and 15 were landmark days for the Hellibees Racing team as its riders and drivers dominated much of the competition at the SLARDAR- and AMRC-organised Pannala Circuit Meet 2015. In fact, each and every Hellibees Racing rider and driver secured either a win or a podium finish despite heavy rains at Pannala somewhat restricting performance on both days.
Hellibees Racing rider Lathika Shamal won first place in both the 125cc and 250cc categories while Sangeeth Suriyage came in first in the 250cc Supermoto and third in the 450cc Supermoto, where Ned Daniel also placed second. Thirteen-year-old Hansika Abeysinghe, the only female rider at Pannala this year was placed third in the 150cc category.
Additionally, Hellibees Racing rider Shoel Daniel came in first in the 600cc category, while also earning a second place finish in the 250cc race even after veering off the track due to heavy rain, with Reza Odayar later taking a second place win in the 1000cc category.
Excitingly, Pannala also saw Hellibees Racing drivers Chandima Goonaratne and Andrew Choksy secure their respective first and third place finishes in the Formula EFI category, with Chandima Goonaratne going on to be crowned the 2015 Formula EFI Champion.
