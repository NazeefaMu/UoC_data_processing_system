She wants to run the show


	



 

The better half of a provincial purohita has become a veritable thorn in the side of the white collar high-ups of this Ministry, they say.

 


This fair one who has arrogated to herself the powers of the purohita has made it a practice to interfere in the workaday affairs in the Ministry. “She would give the Ministry high-ups instructions regarding matters which are none of her business and she would even direct them to submit to her for signature or approval certain documents which the boss himself should attend to,” an informed source said.


This fair one, the daughter of parents who had used political clout  seems to think that the right to exercise power and authority is a family ‘heirloom’.


The henpecked purohita in question despite knowing that his wife has become a meddling nuisance to the Ministry staff would not dare question her actions, they say.
