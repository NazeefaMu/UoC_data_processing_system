President Maithripala Sirisena in his Christmas message said Christmas symbolizes the birth of Jesus Christ who assumed a powerful voice, teaching us lessons of kindness and charity that have lasted for more than 2000 years.
The President's message said: "The Christian message of humanity, love to all beings and humility is seen in the birth of Christ taking place in a stable shared by animals and his first worshippers being bumble shepherds.
"The philosophy of Jesus is both eternal and universal. Irrespective of one’s faith, we all have a sense of duty to ourselves and to one another to make a difference in the world that is genuine and lasting. Keeping in mind the spirit of Christmas and its embedded human values of giving, sharing, forgiving and taking care of others, let us reach out today to people who were affected during the 30 years of war Sri Lanka and lend our hands to make their life better.
"The birth of Jesus Christ paved the way for the liberation of humankind with the new teaching of universal love, tolerance and understanding that he gave to the world. As the ringing of church bells and the singing of festive hymns mark this festival, enjoyed in freedom today, I extend my ‘warmest greetings for a Happy Christmas full of Peace and Joy to all Christians of Sri Lanka".
