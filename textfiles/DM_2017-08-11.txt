The proposal by the government to increase fines for seven traffic offences to Rs.25,000, which had received approval from the government, could only be implemented if the roads and infrastructure in the country are developed according to international standards, Lanka Private Bus Owners' Association (LPBOA) president Gemunu Wijeratne said.
Speaking to Daily Mirror Mr. Wijeratne said yesterday the decision taken by the government to increase fines for certain traffic offences was a good one as it helps to increase road discipline amongst drivers and to deduce the road accidents.
The government should also work towards putting the necessary infrastructure to complement this decision such as setting up hi-tech CCTV roadside accident and traffic monitoring systems. Roads should also be widened to a minimum of four lanes and have separate bus lanes and speed limits being displayed at frequent intervals etc. to ensure the success of this programme.
The new traffic fines should be defined under a specific category. Speed limits should be gazetted for all the roads, if not the police would impose fines on motorists as they wish, Wijeratne warned. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

Saving  us from plastic, one plate at a time
	
Disposable cutlery and containers are products that are a part of our day to day life. As a result of the ever-increasing number of food vendors in Colombo and the suburbs, plastic cups, plates and cutlery that are hardly used are seen tossed intobins regularly.
Dinnerware made from areca sheath
However there is a ban in place connected to disposable items. This means that the ordinary vendor and consumer must both take responsibility, a task that some are less inclined to embrace. A small group of entrepreneurs up North however are already taking action and demonstrating how to take responsibility by providing green solutions to the community. While many lament the inconvenience, this group isnt only making good use of organic material, but also helping the environment, one plate at a time. 
In Thirumurikandy, off the A9 highway, several kilometres before the Iranamadu junction,in Kilinochchi, an elderly gentleman opens the gates of a small enclosure to greet us. A small house sits in the middle of an expansive land with blossoming rows of tender coconut trees planted in between. Areca sheaths hang from ropes tied between trees, drying out in the sun. As we enter the house several young women appear with welcoming smiles. No sooner than we can say hello, the young ladies spring into action, showing us what they are capable of with their new and exciting venture. 
The initiative was launched by our company this year in an effort to promote and embrace a greener lifestyle, Gowri Ananthan of Kudhil products, facilitating this cottage industry said. Our operational, research and development and training unit is situated in Ariviyal Nagar, Killinochi which is mainly focusing on providing job opportunities to war affected communities, she said. The entrepreneurs hope to export the final products to US and Canada as well. 
Manufacturing plates with areca sheath
Apart from this, our company is engaged in importing and supplying machinery to extract banana fibre and to make plates and cups out of areca sheath. We also import and install coir pot making machinery, natural fibre weaving machinery and paper bag making machinery, Gowri elaborated. 
Brand new machines imported from India are installed in the verandah. Small piles of banana tree trunks and areca sheaths sit in the garden closer to the house. It takes a village to make organic disposable plates, we learn. Villagers collect locally grown areca sheaths and the native palmyrah sheaths which they use in the production of disposable dinnerware. Traditionally, areca leaves have been used to pack cooked rice and to preserve treacle made of Fish Tail Palm. Matured stems are used as a building material as well as for decoration of religious events. But in Kilinochchi, the ladies are quite busy collecting sheaths for a better cause. In addition to this, they also use the banana stem, purchased from villagers. 
Once plantains are harvested the banana tree is disposed of, as it bears fruit only once. The stem of the banana plant has long been considered to be high in nutrition value, even though it is disposed of in most banana plantations. As a solution to the increasing issue of processing stem waste, entrepreneurs in South India began manufacturing bio-degradable dinnerware from organic waste such as the banana stem. Extracting good quality fibre from these stems is now a popular business enterprise especially with an increased need for reusable and environment friendlyalternatives in Asia.

The manufacturing of plates involves a process of die cutting. A die is a specialized tool used in manufacturing industries to cut or shape material mostly using a press. Like moulds, dies are generally customized to the item they are used to create. The cutting process using a die is however a simple one. The upper die presses into the lower die assembly, with the dried sheath or leaf placed in between. The machine is operated by pressing a foot pedal. The heat regulator is set to maintain the main die temperature at about 150 Degrees Celsius. The die is heated by domestic energy which makes it ideal for a manufacturing set up in rural areas. 
After a few seconds, the foot on the pedal is withdrawn and a cured leaf plate is produced. Finishing of the product is done by just trimming the edges of the manufactured plate. One of the most noteworthy attributes of this process we noted is that the manufacturing required no adhesive or chemical, making it completely safe for consumers. Its a reliable, biodegradable and compostable alternative to petrochemical based plastic and polystyrene plates.
The plate machine
Still in its experimental and training phase, the employees are enthusiastically testing the possibility of making plates from lotus leaf as well. The revolutionary product is strong like its plastic rival and doent leak. But as we observed, the art of perfecting the skills of plate making is no easy task and requiresefficiency of movement. 
Still in its experimental and training phase, the employees are enthusiastically testing the possibility of making plates from lotus leaf as well
As the sheath is placed on the machine, it cuts and presses a portion of the leaf into a plate. The challenge for the operator is to try and save as much sheath left over as possible for the next plate. They also require the skill to know the precise moment when to lift the heated mold; when the plate is cured, but not burnt. 
Meanwhile at another corner of the house, sat a young lady at a machine extracting fibre from banana sheaths. The extracted fibre after being dried are then woven into fabrics of beautiful shades. Another sat at a sewing machine, stitching together various pieces of woven mat and fabric. The final products they showed us included bags, purses and even pouches for phones.  Successive Sri Lankan governments have always favoured bans, regardless of how prepared the country is to effectively implement it. The polythene and plastic ban which comes into effect from September 1, prevents the use of polythene lunch sheets, rigifoam boxes and shopping bags. While many are praising the move, another group are lamenting the inconvenience it will cause. The women and men of Kilinochchi taking up the challenge of providing a greener alternative, are indeed exemplary.

SL name Chameera, Gamage in squad for Third Test
	
The National Cricket Selectors yesterday included two fast-bowlers to their 15-member squad for the Third and Final Test match against India which will commence at the Pallekele Stadium in Kandy on Saturday (12).
The National Selectors also decided to leave out top order batsman Danushka Gunathilaka.

Lahiru Gamage, who has previously featured in five ODIs for Sri Lanka, and Dushmantha Chameera have been included with Rangana Herath and Nuwan Pradeep missing out due to injuries.
Herath strained his back and following the advice of the Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) Medical Unit was deemed unavailable for selection, also considering the large workload he has undertaken in recent Tests.

Pradeep was injured during the first day of the Second Test, which Sri Lanka lost by an innings and 53 runs, and was ruled out for at least two weeks with a hamstring tear.

Gamage had largely uneventful returns in his five ODIs, taking just two wickets, and is a surprise addition given ordinary recent performances.
Chameera meanwhile, last played a Test in South Africa last year, but featured in four of the five ODIs against Zimbabwe  the series that Sri Lanka lost 2-3.
Sri Lanka have already lost the series having suffered defeats in Galle and Colombo earlier this month and are on the brink of being whitewashed by the Indians at home for the first time.

Sri Lanka Squad:
Dinesh Chandimal (Captain), Angelo Mathews, Upul Tharanga, Dimuth Karunaratne, Niroshan Dickwella, Kusal Mendis, Dhananjaya de Silva, Lahiru Thirimanne, Lahiru Kumara, Vishwa Fernando, Dushmantha Chameera, Lahiru Gamage, Dilruwan Perera, Malinda Pushpakumara and Lakshan Sandakan.

Snuffing the life out of the polythene devil
	
Following long periods of discussions, where there were disparities, the Government of Sri Lanka (GOSL) has shown some consistency in the build up to the ban on using disposable polythene.(The law will be effective from September). This decision will help minimize environmental issues caused by polythene usage.
Its also fitting to note that the Central Environment Authority (CEA) has used all its tricks to promulgate the ban on polythene and the countrys lawgoverning its usage.

Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena, in his capacity as the Minister of Mahaweli Development and Environment, has proposed the implementing of a set of short, mediumand long term measures to minimize the use ofpolythene in Sri Lanka. 
The measures recommended by the committee of intellectuals appointed to study the polythene issue received the approvalof the Cabinet. 
Short term measures proposed by President Sirisena to address the polythene issue:

	Prohibition of polythene use for decorations at all events. 
	
	
	Implementation the prevailing regulations for the prohibition of, use, sale and production of polythene equals or less than 20 microns. 
	
	
	Allowing the use of polythene less than 20 microns for essential activities only on the approval of Central Environmental Authority 
	
	
	Prohibition of sale, importation and production of lunch sheets. 
	
	
	Banning of sale, importation and production of containers, plates, cups and spoons. 
	
	
	Prohibition of the sale of processed or cooked meals packed in polythene containers. 
	
	
	Promotion of providing paper, cloth or reed bags or biologically degradable and environmental friendly plastics for customers when purchasing items. 
	
	
	Prohibition of burning polythene and plastic in open places. 
	
	
	Introduction and promotion of biologically degradable polythene and plastics. 
	
	
	Imposing of 15% CESS during the importation of plastic raw material and related products and providing 5% out of that to the CEA to manage polythene and plastic waste.
	
Glass bottles mustbe made arenewable item

Hemantha Withanage
Centre for Environmental Justice Executive Director Hemantha Withanage revealed to the Dailymirror.lkthat he was one of the committee members of the Eminent Panel appointed to study polythene use.  I was in fact affirmative on this regard and in a position to ban even plastic bottles which havent come under the new regulatory process. But I am glad that the law has been enforced after quite a few attempts in the past, he said.  Withanage proposed that glass bottles could be made renewable as the best alternative for the use of plastic bottles. He recommended the use of oil papers, wax paper bags and items made of sugarcane as the substitutes for polythene and plastic products. 

I should mention that many people who are in support of banning polythene and are waiting to adapt themselves with the use of items made of materials harmless to nature. When this issue came under the spotlight in 1995, it was extremely difficult for the people to get used to it. But after more than 20 years, if anybody says that its still inconvenient to get used to it, that is actually ridiculous. If countries like Rwanda, Morocco, Kenya and most of the European countries can totally ban the use of polythene, why are we incapable of doing it Lets do it for the sake of all Sri Lankans, he pointed out.  He said that the use of polythene should have been nipped in the bud. Therefore, the people of Sri Lanka should make use of this opportunity to do away with the use of polythene and get used to other alternatives. He underscored that Sri Lanka is ranked 5th in the world with regard to disposing garbage in the sea. He also requested the general public to join hands to support this new program and strive to totally eliminate polythene use from Sri Lanka. 
Tax and VAT concessionsfor biodegradable materialand machinery
Ajith Weerasundara
Nevertheless, CEA Waste Management Director Ajith Weerasundara said that they would grant concessions regarding Taxes and VAT during the importation of biodegradable raw material and manufacturing machinery.

We are in a firm position as to put this law into effect irrespective of any circumstances. Central Environment Authority (CEA) as a responsible branch aspires to conserve the environment. For that, we need the assistance and co-operation of the general public, Weerasundara said.  He mentioned that 10%-15% of polythene is inclusive in the total garbage collected daily and that one individual consumes 5kg of polythene per year which could exceed up to 7.2kg in theWestern Province. 
 We have discussed with the polythene manufacturing companies as to how they should face the music. We have recommended some of the products which are biodegradable. Some companies have supported our suggestions, but a few havent,Weerasundara said. 
Substitutes should be environmental friendly
Jagath Gunawardena
Senior Environment Lawyer Jagath Gunawardena when contacted, categorically stated that the problem wasnt regarding the use of polythene, but the manner in which it was disposed of . 
The lack of manageable procedures for the disposal of polythene has been the core issue during the past
The lack of manageable procedures for the disposal of polythene has been the core issue during the past. I dont say that the banning of polythene isnt relevant. Its absolutely essential and pertinent. The government should see that viable alternatives will be accommodated, he opined. Gunawardena further emphasized that substitutes should be environmental friendly and come under the provision of Consumer Affairs Authority.
Govt. should carry out subsidiary measures
Sajeewa Chamikara
Environmentalist and Environmental Conservation Trust Director Sajeewa Chamikara told Dailymirror.lkthat even though it was a bit late to implement the laws for the ban of polythene, the Governments move was greatly commendableand applicable. 
I must say that the polythene issue has become a severe threat to Sri Lanka. Although, several implementations had been put into action, they werent as effective as they shouldhave been.
Therefore, we should be thankful to this Government and the Central Environment Authority for their endeavours to implement the laws and the regulations to ban the use of polythene with effect from September 1, Chamikara said. 
He stressed that if we were to make this a reality, an apposite mechanism in the form of alternatives should be regulated to replace polythene. He pointed out that the government had regulated tax concessions for the importation and manufacturing of biodegradableraw material. 
The government should carry out subsidiary measures for the polythene manufacturers and the public before the law comes into effect to adapt themselves to the new alternatives.
When introducing alternative modes, the Government should ensure that their prices are affordable. The Government should take the pertinent steps to motivate the manufacturers of polythene. Otherwise, this will also be ineffective as it was evident for couple of times in the past,he affirmed. 
Chamikara further said that standards should be maintained and there should be legitimacy in enforcing the laws with respect to the ban on polythene, so as to not make it a
mere prohibition.
Unseen obstacles


In a brief interview with Dailymirror.lk, Sri Lanka Plastic Industry Association Chairman Sarath Wijesinghe, unearthed that the plastic industry in Sri Lanka would soon be in a tight spot due to the ban on polythene. 
The Government hasnt provided enough time for the manufacturers to adjust themselves to alternative conditions. When there are more than thousand registered plastic factories at which there are more than 12,000 employees, the government hasnt monitored its structures before banning polythene. Its not fair, Wijesinghe said. 
He further said that more than 2 million lunch sheets are used daily in relative areas in Colombo. He went on to state that once the ban on polythene is effective, people will have to use items like boxes.
In order to wash them with water, it would require 5 litres of water per day.
He asked whether the Government could provide 5 litres of water per day only to Colombo Therefore, they urged the Government to view this issue in a different perspective and take efficient action to see that the provisions proposed are fair.

7 things to consider in buying a new smartphone in 2017
	

Smartphones these days have become an integral part of everyday life andare used not for just communication but for taking pictures, saving documents on cloud, internet browsing and even as a power bank to charge other smartphones.

But then, with so many smartphones on the market today, it can be kind of challenging to figure out as to what to buy. It is always tough deciding the one that may suit the needs best which makes choosing a phone pretty confusing.

Here's a list of things to be consideredwhich would help to decide to buy the next smartphone. By the end, hopefully a clearer view about WHAT phone to buy and WHY will be transpired.

1. Build quality &Design
Build is all about durability of a smartphone. The entire handset market is largely divided in two types of builds -metal and plastic. Though the definition of a good or bad smartphone design is highly subjective, but if you care about build quality and aesthetics, look for a metal or glass design, or a phone that offers both or having glass-coated panels, though they are very limited. There are some cheap handsets that have plastic bodies, but in general, should be avoided unless the top consideration is to save money.

A handful of phones, go the extra mile by featuring a shatterproof glass display. But at the very least, one should shop for a phone that has a Gorilla Glass display, which should protect the device from short drops (though a protective case will help with that, too).

If the user is one of those prone to dropping the smartphone, it's advisable to go for a metal or a plastic built handset.These can sustain drops from 2-3 feet, while glass-based handset are sure to shatter.

Also there comes the element of gender. Females, might want to think about the size, does it fit nicely in to a handbag or not. For the males, does it fit nicely in ones pocket without bulging out.

OPPO F3 - 5.5-inch 1080p IPS LCD, Protected by Gorilla Glass 5
Huawei P10 - Gorilla Glass 5
Samsung  Corning Gorilla Glass 5


2. Price& Whats most important to you
Price has to be affordable. One has to ask oneself what he or she will be actually doing with the phone, as most modern flagships are built with unnecessary list of specs that most people seldom take advantage of.

One can save thousands of Sri Lankan Rupees just by opting for a cheaper model, or an older model, for instance, and still get everything done that one needs to. If someone literally just using it for calls, texts, email and some web browsing, getting an older model is not a bad idea. Most will never notice the difference.

Battery The camera Overall cost You need to decide what you want from a phone and have clear objectives and ideas about how youre going to be using it. Think about what you use most in your every day-to-day life already.

HuaweiPrice range LKR: 8,000.00-100,000.00
Samsung Price range LKR: 3,000.00  120,000.00
OPPO Price range LKR: 22,000.00-70,000.00


3. Operating System: Android, iOS or Other
User interface and the OS version too are key factors to consider while choosing a smartphone. These are the interfaces that one would have to interact with each time to access anything, so it should be easy and simple. One need to consider what operating system suitable for his or her needs. Some applications might not be available on some operating systems. So, trying the handset before actually picking one is highly recommended.

Android
Android dominates worldwide smartphone sales, and for good reason. You'll find many more choices than iOS when it comes to design, display size, specs, capabilities and price tag. Additionally, Android is an open OS, which means it's easier to customize with awesome launchers and widgets.

Huawei P10 - Android 7.0 (Nougat)
OPPO F3 - Android 6.0 (Marshmallow)
Nokia 6 - Android 7.1.1 (Nougat)
Samsung S8 - Android 7.0 (Nougat)

iOS 10
All of the latest iPhones  including the iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus and iPhone SE run the latest version of Apple's operating system. iOS 10 offers several enhancements, including a more interactive and expressive Messages app, an improved Siri that plugs into more apps and a Home app that helps you control smart home gadgets.

iPhone 7 - iOS 10.0.1, upgradable to iOS 10.3.3


4. Old Hardware, Doesnt Mean Obsolete Hardware
Why Simple, really: these modern things we call smartphones are exceptional pieces of technology. One does not need to buy a brand new phone to get decent performance.

Some phones will still feel like a new phone even if it isnt the latest model. Phones get worn down by usage; buy an older model new and one will not experience this  these phones are future-proofed to the hilt!


5. Camera
Smartphone cameras are becoming even much better than there were ever before and we have arrived at a point in smartphone evolution where the camera matters more than the processor, especially considering most people use their phones as their primary capture moments. More and more smartphones boast cameras with at least 12 megapixels, but it is better not only to focus on that statistics as image quality, ISO levels, camera aperture, speed andthe low-light performance are essential as well.

More number of pixels mean more the size of the image, which becomes sharper when seen on a small screen. A photographer enthusiasts might want a camera with 12 or 16MP sensor under f/2.0 or lower aperture for speedy shots even in low lights. A casual capture can go by even with an 8MP 0r 12MP camera with f/2.0-f/2.2 aperture.

Dual front cameras

VIVO V5 PLUS: Not available in Sri Lanka
The V5 Plus has 20MP primary plus 8MP secondary sensor with f2.0 aperture and a selfie flash. There is a dedicated mode for taking selfies with background blur on the phone. It has a 5.5-inch full HD display and a 16MP rear camera with f2.0 aperture. Inside is a Snapdragon 625 processor, 4GB RAM, 64GB storage and a 3,160mAh battery.

OPPO F3 PLUS: LKR 43,990.00
OPPOS smartphone with dual front cameras is aimed at selfie enthusiasts who want to take wide-angle selfies. The OPPO F3 Plus has 16MP + 8MP front camera setup with f2.0 aperture and a wide-angle mode in the camera interface. The phone has a 6-inch full HD display and a 16MP rear camera with f1.7 aperture. Hardware specifications include Snapdragon 653 processor, 4GB RAM, 64GB storage and a 4,000mAh battery.


6. Internal Storage
A large part of the smartphones storage is taken away from the OS and the apps the device comes pre-installed with. It is better to opt for as much internal storage as possible given that some games can easily take up more than 1GB of storage  not to mention how many high-res photos and videos smartphone owners are capturing The minimum on most premium handsets these days is 32GB. 64GB is recommended when there will be significant shooting of photos and video.

On can also buy a 16GB model that supports microSD card as well. A microSD card can help expand the storage. It's available on many Android phones.


7. Battery Life
This is very crucial and also very important. The battery usage differs from user to user depending on the way he/she uses the smartphone. Many factors  including the screen size, processor and operating system  determine how long a smartphone can lasts long on a single charge. Generally, we consider any phone that lasts longer than 9 hours of straight 4G LTE surfing to be very good & beneficial.

Battery capacity is a specifications that can help determine a phone's potential staying in power, but it's not as reliable as test results. Nevertheless, look for a phone battery with at least 3,000 mAh if best chance at long battery life to be achieved. Some smartphones now have extra features that allows to actually put it in a mode where it can last longer.

OPPO VOCC Charger - A thirty-minute charge will get the mobile phone to 75% of battery. With 4x fastercharging speed than conventional chargers, the VOOC flash charging system will haveyour phone ready to go when you are on your way out the door. A thirty-minute charge will get the mobile phone to 75% of battery. With 4x fastercharging speed thanconventional chargers, the VOOC flash charging system will have the phone ready to go within in 30 mins.

Wijeyadasa violates collective responsibility: Harsha
	
Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe express his own opinion on any subject but it is wrong to make a statement on a subject on which a collective decision was taken by the Cabinet of which he was a member, State Minister Harsha De Silva said today.
Responding to questions asked by a journalist referring to the statement made by the minister on the Hambantota Port earlier this month.
The state minister said it was unethical of the minister to do so.
He said he saw on the web about a no-confidence motion against the Justice Minister but but was unaware of any such moves adding that party matters would be discussed with the Prime Minister and the party leaders while Cabinet would be sorted out in the Cabinet.
The state minister said the UNP created a new trend with Minister Ravi Karunanayakes resignation and that the UNP had no intention of influencing the Attorney General's Department.
He said under the previous regime the AG's Department was under former president Mahinda Rajapaksa and it functioned to suit his dictates. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
