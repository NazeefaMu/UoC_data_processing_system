A recent partnership between DFCC Bank and JohnKeells will facilitate flexible and affordable payment terms exclusively for John Keells Properties’ customers.

The exciting new loan package from DFCC, available exclusively for John Keells Properties developments, will offer up to 20-year home loans with a grace period of five years, together with concessions for early settlements. Additionally, the DFCC/John Keells partnership enables homebuyers to lock in their apartment purchases with just a 10% downpayment, and spread their remaining equity contributions over the construction period.

The new DFCC home loan package can be obtained through the Bank’s branch network of138branches operating across the island, and sector specialists will be made available to guide and assist in processing and releasing home loans.

“Lack of access to affordable mortgages is a key stumbling block for urban professionals who want to buy quality housing in convenient locations in the city. As a result so many people resign to spending 2-3 hours or more a day commuting,” said Nayana Mawilmada, Sector Head of the Property Group at John Keells Holdings.   “We want to change that. DFCC has worked closely with us to go the extra mile in developing an industry-leading mortgage product specifically for our customers. The partnership between John Keells Properties and DFCC is a reflection of our shared vision to enable aspiring home owners to purchase their dream home.” 

TRI-ZEN, the latest development by John Keells Properties is aimed at meeting the demand for high quality urban housing in the very heart of the city, eliminating the need for painful commutes and introducing residents to a whole new level of convenience and lifestyle. The 53-storey landmark project is a joint venture between John Keells Holdings and Indra Traders (Pvt) Ltd. 

The highly anticipated ‘smart living spaces’ apartment complex -with units currently up for sale starting from Rs. 23 million- is scheduled for completion in 2023. Located at the heart of Union Place -the city’s most vibrant urban neighbourhood, residents of TRI-ZEN will have easy access to Colombo’s best schools, hospitals, restaurants, and retailers. Boasting high-tech, fully device-controlled apartments, John Keells’ current venture is tipped to be the most sought-after property in town.
