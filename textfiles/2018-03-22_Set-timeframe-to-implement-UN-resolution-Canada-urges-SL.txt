The Canadian Government today urged the Sri Lankan government to set a time-bound strategy for full implementation of the UN Resolution, with technical support from the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR).

“We call on Sri Lanka to meet its domestic and international human rights obligations to ensure a peaceful, reconciled and prosperous future for all Sri Lankans,” it said in a statement.

Canada welcomed the High Commissioner’s Representative’s report on Sri Lanka and aid it supports the government’s constructive engagement with the OHCHR.

“We acknowledge the initial steps taken on human rights and welcome the establishment of the Office of Missing Persons. We call for its full operationalization and implementation,” it said.

It said the Wednesday’s report at the 37th UNHRC session in Geneva  highlighted that continued effort is needed on transitional justice, including reparations, truth seeking and accountability mechanisms and on implementing confidence-building measures critical to reconciliation such as repeal of the Prevention of Terrorism Act.
