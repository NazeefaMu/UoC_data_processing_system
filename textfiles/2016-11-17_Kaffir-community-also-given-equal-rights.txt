Steps have been taken to ensure that the Kaffir community of African origin which resides in Puttalam and elsewhere are given equal rights as other Sri Lanka citizens, Parliament was informed today.

Responding to an oral question raised by MP Buddhika Pathirana in the House, Industry and Commerce Deputy Minister Nimal Lansa said members of this community were given all rights and their children were being absorbed to schools while their culture had also been recognized as one that should be preserved.

The Deputy Minister said 35 Kaffir families lived in Puttalam now while a few members lived in the Galle and Hambantota District as well.

However, Mr Pathirana rejected these claims saying these people faced various difficulties. He said some of these people did not even have national identity cards.

He said Sri Lankans of Chinese origin who live in Colombo and a few descendants of the Portuguese were also facing similar issues.

Deputy Minister Lansa said he would look into such issues pertaining to this community if they were presented to the government.(Yohan Perera)
