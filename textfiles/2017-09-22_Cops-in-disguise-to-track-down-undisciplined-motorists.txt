A special programme will be initiated from tomorrow to track down undisciplined motorists within the Colombo City limits, police said.

Police media spokesman SP Ruwan Gunasekara said according to the programme, police officers in civvies would travel in ordinary vehicles covering several areas within the city limits and will observe the motorists' behaviour.

He said details of undisciplined motorists would be informed to the police officers in the official outfit on road duties and thereafter those vehicles would be stopped and proceed with legal action.

SP Gunasekara said that the programme was initiated in a bid to reduce road accidents by creating disciplined motorists. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
