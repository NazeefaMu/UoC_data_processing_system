[APPRECIATIONS - (02-09-2015)]


Kirthi Sri Karunaratne:
The king reigns no more
And indeed that is exactly what Kirthi was - the king of Sri Lanka's fashion world where he reigned and held court for more than three score years and ten.
Kirthi Sri Karunaratne is no more but he leaves a legacy of not just fashion and trends which he created, but memories that his thousands of friends will cherish, of Kirthi the Man, not the Fashion Guru and Fashion Icon that he was often termed!
A gentleman to his finger tips, generous to a fault, simple and humble in demeanour all his life, a sincere and loving friend, a master chef; while his home was always home to his many friends; Kirthi was a man in a million!
"It all began with sketching and turning out clothes, mostly for my mother and cousins while still at school in Ananda College, aiming to be a doctor," said Kirthi reminiscing on his career in fashion over a cup of tea with me some years ago.
A career which spanned over three score years and ten, no mean feat ! In fact even a few months ago, no sooner he had returned home from hospital I asked him if he would be well enough to do me a sari for a wedding and his response was "of course".
Kirthi has worked with leading designers of his day, including John Cavanaugh in London, in Paris at the House of Dior and in Rome with Emilio Schubert.
He held on to the title of Sri Lanka's 'Fashion Guru' throughout his lifetime, a title nobody ever disputed or will dispute even now when he is no more.
I myself have known Kirthi for over 40 years.
As a young girl, I would stare at him goggle eyed wherever I saw him, be it the Lionel Wendt, the Liberty or Regal Cinemas [oh yes in those days you did dress up even to go to the movies], the Lionel Wendt, parties and weddings.
The first occasion [I recall] where Kirthi published my picture in the papers, I would have been about 15 or 16 years and was in a shocking pink sari which I had draped Koorg style, and on seeing my picture in the papers, I was so excited, I couldn't wait to bump into the Great Man and thank him!
However when I did see him next, I was too tongue tied to do so and just grinned at him from ear to ear too bashful to approach him.
Subsequently through my involvement in the theatre, Kirthi and I soon became good friends, with not a week passing where I did not visit Kirthi; to consult him on clothes, make up, pester him to make my nose slimmer, mouth smaller, achieve more height by wearing the appropriate type of clothing, eat his famous 'hakuru mas' or crab curry, and of course absorb as much fashion sense as I could from the great man.
His home at Norris Canal Road was always a hive of activity, with people, coming and going at all odd hours of the day.
Models, actresses, socialites, you name them , they were all there! One of Kirthi's most endearing traits and one he always possessed was that he treated everyone alike, regardless of their status in life - be it the wife of the richest man in Sri Lanka, or a humble lad from a remote village who aspired to be a model or film star.
Kirthi treated them all alike, with his own brand of unfailing courtesy and charm, guaranteed to put anyone at ease.
Kirthi over the years dressed more people than most international designers I would think. He endured and improved with age like wine.
From brides to beauty queens, to models and housewives, gauche young girls [like myself] and acclaimed society hostesses, Kirthi has been friend and confidante to one and all and has even dressed three generations of brides.
"It is a great joy that I still have a clientele that spans thee generations," he once told me.
In the 50's and 60's and even in the 70's and 80's, fashion shows were not the products of 'high tech' as they are now, with laser beams flashing and strobe lights popping and every other gimmick you can think of.
Instead they demanded craftsmanship, ingenuity, creativity and a very fertile imagination.
Resources were meager, whilst prior to the advent of TV, especially Fashion TV, all we had to go by on were the occasional foreign magazine, which during the tenure of certain of our leaders, achieved the status of black market luxury items!! Kirthi achieved the impossible; putting on fashion shows and beauty pageants which were an absolute wonder to behold.
In the theatre and cinema, once again Kirthi excelled.
Apart from designing costumes, he enjoyed taking part in both films and plays.
Here too once again Kirthi displayed his versatility, going on to excel in these areas as well.
The pinnacle of costume design for Kirthi was doing the outfits for Lester James Pieris' 'Nidhanaya'; a film Kirthi recalled demanded every ounce of his creativity.
The versatile Kirthi also possessed a good voice which was put to use even as recently as a few months ago.
He has sung with Deva Surya Sena, the Colombo Philharmonic Orchestra, at concerts and private parties, and was very much in demand for his musical virtuosity as he was for his fashion sense.
Yet another achievement was the fact that Kirthi wrote an unbroken column for newspapers for over a period of 50 years.
Today one has to make appointments for anything - right down to even dropping in on your best friend! With Kirthi however I would just breeze in, demanding something to eat and drink as I am always hungry and then going on to ask him for any left overs for the stray dogs in the vicinity.
Kirthi over the years never changed, be it his attitude to life which was one of enjoying himself and living life to the full, how he dealt with the many and varied people who walked in and out of his life on a daily basis, as well as - and here I know we all envied him; HIS APPEARANCE, which was more or less the same as when I first set eyes on him! Kirthi worked daily and more often than not a seven day week, partied every night, more often at more than one venue, found time to cook and has never to my knowledge, indulged in 40 winks in the afternoon.
How did he do it? I personally think it was his attitude to life which was one of try everything and do it to the best of your ability, enjoy yourself no matter what and take each day as it comes! A formula that has worked, as we all know. Today we celebrate Kirthi's life, his phenomenal achievements, and wish him godspeed. I for one, along with most of his legion of friends, would like to thank him, not for putting our pictures in the papers [ which of course we all loved ], or for making us look good, but for being friend, confidante, and a wonderful human being.
We will all miss him terribly, but his memory will always remain in our hearts as his clothes will continue to hang in our cupboards!

Dr Ajantha Horadagoda:
She did much for veterinary science field
I was extremely sad to hear the unexpected and sudden demise of Dr. Ajantha Horadagoda in Sydney, Australia.
I came to know Ajantha when she was an undergraduate at the University of Peradeniya.
At that time I was so impressed by her performance that I knew that one day she would come up in life and serve the world. This was actually what happened in her life.
After graduating with a veterinary degree from the University of Peradeniya, she proceeded abroad and completed a PhD degree. Unlike other postgraduates, qualified abroad, Dr. Ajantha and her husband, Dr Neil Horadagoda, returned home and assumed positions as senior lecturers at the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine and Animal Science, University of Peradeniya.
Dr Ajantha served at the Faculty for about 23 years from 1979 to 2002, teaching undergraduates and conducting research.
After serving for a long period in Sri Lanka, she proceeded to Australia and worked as a scientist at the University of Sydney.
She later became the Head of the Research Laboratory, which was named as 'Future Dairy' Laboratory. She served in this position for almost 12 years, from 2004 - 2015.
It certainly must be sad to her husband, Neil and their two children to face the situation where Ajantha left them suddenly.
She served the world, Sri Lanka and Australia and many other countries followed research findings of Dr Ajantha.
I hope that the pain of her husband and the two sons would become less with time and being aware of what efforts she made to improve the veterinary science field of the world.
May Dr. Ajantha attain Nibbana.
Dr. A. S. Abeyratne

D.P.P. Samarasekera:
Strict disciplinarian
and stickler to rules
On October 17 my friend Nandadeva called to say that his father had passed away.
I was dumbfounded and took awhile before I could regain my composure and express my heartiest condolences to him on the passing away of his father, a man I knew for over 40 years.
D.P.P. Samarasekera affectionately known as Sam among his friends lived a full life of 91 years. He gifted to the world eight children who are doing well in their lives. My friend from childhood Nandadeva whose eldest son is the incumbent Professor of Surgery at the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Colombo. Samarasekera as a public officer of the highest calibre who functioned as the Registrar of the University of Colombo, an exalted position in university in times gone by.
After retirement he proceeded to Papua New Guinea to share his vast experience in university administration with the university there.
He was a strict disciplinarian and stickler to rules whether at work or at home.
Later in life, he looked after his wife who was afflicted with Alzheimer's disease with compassion and understanding for many years until her demise.
My interaction with him grew during those long years he attended to his ailing wife during which time he shared with me with pride and joy many interesting stories of his university life.
He made it a point to invite me personally for numerous religious events conduced in memory of his wife.
His contribution to the Buddhist order as recounted by the monks who attended his funeral was immense.
In keeping with this wishes he was accorded a private funeral within the shortest possible time.
May he attain the supreme bliss of Nibbana.
