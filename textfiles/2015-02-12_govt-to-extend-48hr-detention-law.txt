	The government was preparing to extend the Procedure to detain a suspect arrested without a warrant up to 48 hours by another two years, a top source said.
	“It would seriously affect on country’s Human Rights records,” Human Rights Commissioner Dr. Prathibha Mahanamahewa said today.
	The government is preparing to extend the provisions of Code of Criminal Procedure (Special Provision) Act No.2 of 2013 by another two years enabling to detain a suspect arrested without a warrant up to 48.
	Dr. Mahanamahewa said that the amendments made to the Code of Criminal Procedure (Special Provision) Act were passed in Parliament in 2013 for a period of two years.
	He said the government was preparing to extend it for another two years in contrast to the LLRC recommendations that an arrested person should be produced before a Court soon after the arrest was made.
	“The provisions of this controversial Act which was passed by Parliament for two years are to be expired by this week.
	“We reliably got to know that this government is also preparing to extend it for another two years. It would badly affect for country’s Human Rights situation because we have already undertaken to implement LLRC recommendations to protect and promote human rights,” he said.(Lakmal Sooriyagoda)
