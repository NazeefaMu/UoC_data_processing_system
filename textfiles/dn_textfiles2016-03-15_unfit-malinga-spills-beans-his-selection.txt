Unfit Malinga spills the beans on his selection

 
A half-fit Lasith Malinga was on the flight to Kolkata on Monday with faint hopes of being fit to play in his country’s opening ICC World Twenty20 fixture against Afghanistan on March 17.
Malinga did not leave for India with the Sri Lanka team as he was undergoing treatment for an injured left knee which according to him has to take its own time and heal.
The injury which Malinga described as a “bone bruise” is according to medical experts a traumatic injury sustained from a forceful impact during sports, accident or a direct hit. It is characterized by a severe pain that can last for weeks or months and the best way to help the healing process is to rest, support and protect the bone or joint involved and to apply conventional treatments for trauma.
“This is a bone injury that cannot be operated or treated medically. I am having only some injections (not pain killers) to make it heal. The only remedy for it is rest,” said Malinga at the Bandaranaike International Airport yesterday while waiting for his flight to be rescheduled after it was delayed due to a technical fault.
Malinga was travelling on the direct flight from Colombo to Kolkata on Mihinair. The flight which was originally scheduled for 6.30 am finally took off at 3.30 p.m.
Spilling the beans on his ‘forced’ selection to the team Malinga said that he had informed the selection committee headed by Kapila Wijegunawardene as well as the one headed by Aravinda de Silva not to select him for the Asia Cup or the World T20 as he was not fully fit for the two tournaments.
However the two selection committees went ahead and picked him apparently on his reputation as being one of the leading fast bowlers of his kind in the world. He is in fact the leading wicket-taker in the World T20 tournament with 38 wickets from 31 matches and overall has taken 382 wickets in all levels of T20 cricket.
“Why do the selectors want to pick a half fit bowler like me when there are other fit bowlers around?” Malinga asked journalists who were on the same flight with him.
In the Asia Cup, Malinga played in the opening game against UAE, took four wickets and won the match for his country but at great cost because he aggravated his injured knee and was out for the rest of the tournament.
Subsequently on the team’s return Malinga stepped down from the Sri Lanka T20 captaincy to give himself time to recover from his injury. Angelo Mathews was subsequently selected as captain to replace him as captain for the World T20.
“I will practice in the next few days with the team and see how my knee is taking up the pressure. If I don’t feel any pain I will play in the opening match, but if not it is a decision for the selectors to make,” said Malinga who admitted that he feels a slight pain in his knee when walking.
Malinga’s progress according to Sri Lanka Cricket sources will be monitored by the team physio Steve Mount and he will train with the team before a final call will be taken on his fitness.
