Afterwards, it will be presented in Parliament on October 19. The Government outlines its allocations for each Ministry and the borrowing limit in the Appropriation Bill presented for each year ahead of the budget debate.

Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake is planning to make his maiden budget speech on November 10. However, it is uncertain whether he will be able to do it on the scheduled day.
