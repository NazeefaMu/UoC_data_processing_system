The Knot's 50 Best Place in the world to Honeymoon

 
The River House, Balapitiya has been selected as the only escape in Sri Lanka to be featured in The Knot's 50 Best Places in the World to Honeymoon in 2015. TheKnot.com is the No. 1 website in the United States for all things weddings. Each year TheKnot.com creates a list of the most idyllic honeymoon destinations in the world, seeking only the most exotic places. For The River House, a property of Asia Leisure, this accolade represents the core of what is offered as a place of seclusion and sensuality.
Situated on the banks of the grand Madhu Ganga in southern Sri Lanka, The River House with its 5 uniquely designed suites on 13 acres of lush tropical garden is a blissful sojourn into seclusion. The Menik Suite with a carefully curated collection of art may well feel like a living gallery. Offering stunning views of the river beyond, the Suite's private balcony and spectacular plunge pool for two have received a special mention by TheKnot.com as 'Seriously Sexy'. Incidentally the Menik Suite has also been named by none other than CNN Travel as a 'Sexy Skinny Dip Spot' of the world.
The Gin Suite with its exquisitely appointed spacious lounge and private garden let guests stay in the lap of luxury. The Walawe Suite nestles closer to river bank and stands apart for even greater privacy. Each of these suites offer an open-air jacuzzi for two that lets couples slip in side by side as a waterfall spills gently from above. The Kala and Kirinda Suites with a private garden let guests laze by a pond dotted with blue lotus blossoms or enjoy a shower in a bathroom that opens out to the nature beyond.
Enveloped in stillness, the poolside of The River House too gets a special mention by TheKnot.com, 'Hang out at the pool, ensconced within the jungle greenery. It feels wonderfully private, except for the monkeys swinging from the trees'.
The River House, with its amenities great and small ranging from the most discreet butler service imaginable to in-suite massages, seems the perfect match for TheKnot.com's Best Places to Honeymoon in 2015. Asia Leisure, a subsidiary of Asia Capital PLC is honoured to have received this recognition.
