World Food Day and food security

World Food Day is a day of action against hunger. On October 16, nations come together to declare their commitment to eradicate hunger from the world. This day was declared by FAO's member countries on its 20th General Assembly in 1979. Since then this day has been observed every year on October 16 highlighting the awareness of the issue of hunger and food security.
The objectives of the World Food Day are
*To heighten public awareness of the problem of hunger in the world
*To encourage attention to agricultural food production and stimulate national, bi-national, multinational and nongovernmental effort
*To promote the transfer of agriculture technologies to the developing world
*To promote international and national solidarity in the struggle against hunger, malnutrition and poverty and draw attention to achievement in food and agricultural development
*To encourage the participation of rural people, particularly women and the least privileged categories in decision making and activities influencing their living conditions
*To encourage economic and technical cooperation among developing countries.
FAO's mandate is to raise levels of nutrition, improve agricultural productivity, improve the lives of rural population and contribute to the growth of world economy that no child, women or man has to live with food insecurity.
World Food Day has selected different themes every year to highlight areas needed to take action since 1981. The theme this year is 'Social protection and agriculture - Breaking the cycle of rural poverty.' Social protection is a basic right recognised by the UN and the ILO. It consists of policies and programmes designed by governments and the private sector to eradicate poverty and economic and social vulnerabilities of poor people.
It promotes human welfare, social security, social stability, economic growth and to live in dignity. Social protection can be generated by agriculture through input subsidies, input grants extension services, hi yielding varieties, storage and marketing facilities.
Social protection and agriculture interventions are powerful tools to improve food security. Agriculture growth leads to stable food security and greater income to manage risks of hunger and poverty.
About 73 percent of the world population have no access to adequate social protection. The majority of them live in the rural areas of developing countries many of them dependent on agriculture to make a living. Incorporating social protection policies in to national programmes on agriculture, fisheries and livestock can help to improve productivity income generation and market functioning and food security for the vulnerable households.
Food security is not just an issue of vulnerable people. It is much larger issue that involves the whole food system and affects every one of us in some way .issues such as whether households get enough food, how it is distributed within the household and whether that food fulfils the nutritional needs of all members of the household show that food security is linked to health.
Food security and nutrition is inter linked and cannot be separated. It directly affects the dietary energy supply of the population.
Therefore food security can be described as a phenomenon relating to individuals. It is the nutritional status of household member that is ultimate focus. It is an inter grated system and includes every action from farm to table.
The world has the resources and technology to eradicate hunger and ensure long term food security for all in spite of many challengers and risks through a 21st century GREEN REVOLUTION.
It however needs a combined effort by everyone. Food production was in pace with the population increase up to now. Therefore as the largest humanitarian organization fighting the hunger in the world FAO's aim of "Food for All" will be a reality to ensure the food security in the future world.
