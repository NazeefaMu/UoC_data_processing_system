The joint opposition today announced that they would support the Government Medical Officers’ Association’s (GMOA) decision to engage in a country-wide strike on Friday against the controversial SAITM issue.

Joint opposition Leader MP Dinesh Gunawardena speaking at a media briefing said the government had continuously postponed its decision on the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) despite being held responsible to provide a solution. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)
