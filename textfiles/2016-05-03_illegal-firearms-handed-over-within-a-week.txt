At least 84 illegal firearms have been handed over to the government so far during the amnesty period declared by the Defence Ministry on April 25.

Military Spokesman Jayanath Jayaweera said more than 21 illegal firearms were handed over from the Gampaha district while 11 firearms were from Colombo.

The ministry declared a general amnesty period from April 25 to May 6 so that those who possessed illegal firearms could hand them over to the nearest Police Station, the District Secretariat or the Pradeshiya Saba.

Ministry said Rs.5,000 will be paid as compensation for shotguns and similar firearms, Rs.10,000 for pistols and revolvers while Rs.25,000 for T56 weapons.

The weapons handed over include, 12 firearms from Puttalam, nine from Ratnapura, six from Kandy, five each from Matara and Galle and four from Kalutara.

Brigadier Jayaweera requested anyone in possession of illegal firearms to hand them over on or before May 6.
 
“Legal action will not be taken against any of those who handover the illegal firearms, but however, we will conduct raids after the amnesty period is over and stringent legal action will be taken against those found in possession of such weapons,” he said.(Darshana Sanjeewa)
