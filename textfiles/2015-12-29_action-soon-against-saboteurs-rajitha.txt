	President Maithripala Sirisena and the leaders of the political parties in the ruling alliance had decided to take firm action against those who were planning to sabotage the Government’s plans to even go beyond Yahapalanaya (Good Governance) policies, a senior Minister said yesterday.
	Cabinet Spokesman and Minister of Health Dr. Rajitha Senaratne told a news conference those who were trying to topple the government would be countered effectively in the future.
	“Various political parties and groups who are allies of the government met President Sirisena on Monday and decided that we cannot follow Yahapalanaya (Good Governance) policies in dealing with those who were trying to sabotage the Government’s plans,” the Minister said.
	Senaratne said these forces were trying to create havoc in the country as they had become politically bankrupt.
	“Acts of sabotage have been planned as the government is about to arrest some important people belonging to a famous family with regard to the killing of ruggerite Thajudeen,” he said
	The Minister therefore said killers of Thajudeen would be nabbed soon.
	However, he accepted that there was delay in arresting those who were involved in the Avant Garde case.
	He said delay was due a delay in the process at the Attorney General’s Department as well.
	Asked about the allegations made against some of the government politicians of accepting monetary rewards from Avant Garde owners, the Minister said “Some fools somersaulted where even gods feared to tread.”
	He said all those in the government, who were accused of various unlawful acts would be dealt with soon.
	This was highlighted in response to a serious of questions asked by the journalists, including over the abduction case in which supporters of MP Hirunika Premachandra were involved.
	The Minister denied allegations that he himself had phoned the Police and asked them to drop the case against Ms. Premachandra.
	“I don’t even phone the Police station in my village and also I was out of the country, when the incident happened,” he said. (Yohan Perera)
