Former India cricket captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni was this morning safely rescued from a fire in a hotel in Delhi's Dwarka neighbourhood.

No casualties were reported in the fire, Delhi Fire Services said. They added that they got a call around 6:30am alerting them there was a fire inside the WelcomHotel, which is located in Sector 10, Dwarka. As many as 30 fire tenders were sent to the spot and the fire was brought under control at 7:50am.

Dhoni was in the Capital with his Jharkhand team to play in the Vijay Hazare Trophy semi-final. The team's kit has apparently been reduced to ashes and consequentially the match has been postponed for tomorrow.

The Dhoni-led Jharkhand team entered the semifinals of the Vijay Hazare Trophy after outplaying Vidarbha by six wickets at the Palam Ground here on Wednesday, PTI reported.

Besides being Jharkhand's unofficial mentor in the Ranji Trophy, Dhoni has been an active member of the Vijay Hazare squad, captaining the side in all the six matches so far. His participation in the tournament has been attracting sizeable crowds wherever Jharkhand, PTI reported.

These matches were being seen as Dhoni's last competitive games in the 50-over format ahead of the Champions Trophy in June, a tournament seen as an important one for the former India captain, who now plays only as a wicket-keeper batsman in the national side.
