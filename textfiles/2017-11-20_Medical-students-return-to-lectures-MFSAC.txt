Medical students return to lectures: MFSAC


	

Medical Faculty students today resumed the studies after ten months lapse, Medical Faculty Student Action Committee (MFSAC) Convener Ryan Jayalath said.

Addressing a press conference, he said the students agreed to attend the classes following the Government’s final decision to abolish the SAITM.

However, he said it was noticeable that the government was attempting to allegedly continue the institute in a different form against the agreement, and therefore it is possible to boycott the lectures without prior notice, if the government’s double standard continues.

“The government is attempting to handover SAITM to SLIIT despite its assurance to abolish it completely. If it happens in that manner, the Government should keep in mind that we are capable in taking stern action more vigorously than we did in the past. There is a possibility for the students to boycott the lectures again,” he said. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
