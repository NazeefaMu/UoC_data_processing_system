“Bank of Ceylon, as a state bank, can proudly say that it backs the economy of the country in very specials ways such as through financial inclusion.

Similarly to the other two green branches, the interior of the Kekirawa branch is designed to let in as much daylight as possible to minimize the usage of electricity during day time. At the same time, solar panels will be fixed soon to produce a major portion of the electricity used by the branch. All necessary fixtures and fittings are environmentally certified. These include air conditioners that have invertor technology and are CFC free. 
The branch also includes a vertical green garden that helps to maintain a comfortable interior temperature and which refreshes air and improves air quality and uplifts the overall atmosphere.

The branch offers to the residents of Kekirawa all banking services that range from personal banking to banking for businesses. These include all savings and current account maintenance, personal and business loans, loans for the micro and SME sectors, pawning facility and it is also equipped with 24-hour activated SmartZone with a cash deposit machine (CDM) and ATM.
