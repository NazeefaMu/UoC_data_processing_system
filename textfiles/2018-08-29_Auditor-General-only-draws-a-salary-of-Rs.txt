Auditor General only draws a salary of Rs. 69,000


	

Auditor General Gamini Wijesinghe, who is also the Chairman of the National Audit Commission, said yesterday that he was drawing only a monthly salary of Rs. 69,000 which is sufficient only to foot his monthly electricity and telephone bills.

He said he was not paid the salary increment due to him for the past three months.

Mr. Wijesinghe stated that although he was not working as the Auditor General and the Chairman of the National Audit Commission for financial gain it was only right that he be an acceptable salary.

While a motion for the payment of a salary increment with retrospective effect from November 23, 2015 and other relevant remunerations to Mr. Wijesinghe had been included in the Order Paper in Parliament for the approval of the House, it was withdrawn by Leader of the House Lakshman Kiriella on the day it was to be taken up on August 23 with the hope of re-submitting it for approval on a later date.(Shiran Ranasinghe)
