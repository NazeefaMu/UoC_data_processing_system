This Govt. no second to former: Anti Corruption Front


	

The Anti Corruption Front (ACF) today charged that the present government was no second to the former government considering the frauds and corruption that had occurred during the first 59 days of 100 days programme.
The ACF insisted on a fully-fledged inquiry into an alleged insider dealing that had taken place during the financial bonds issue by the Central Bank (CB).
There were reports of alleged deals made by Perpetual Treasuries, a firm with connections to Arjun Aloysius, the son-in-law of the current governor, Arjun Mahendran.
ACF member Shiral Lakthilake urged the CB Governor to make a public statement on this matter.
“Appointing a three member committee to investigate this is not enough. A formal, transparent investigation is essential. The governor should resign temporarily till the investigation is completed. That is the only way to ensure transparency,” he said.
The Front said it was necessary to conduct an internal management audit at all government institutions as a measure to eradicate frauds and corruption. (Piyumi Fonseka)
