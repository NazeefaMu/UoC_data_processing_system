The Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) organisation today urged the government to launch a domestic probe on the violations of the 1815 Kandyan Convention, the ransacking of the national heritage and the unethical conversion of Buddhists by the British.
“It has been 200 years since the signing of the convention, which was severely violated by the British. We urge the government to probe these violations and also the massacre of the people in the country by the British,” BBS General Secretary Ven. Galagodaatte Gnanasara Thera told a news conference.
The Thera said the terrorist activities during 1971-1989, the LTTE terrorism during 1983-2009 and the alleged conspiracy that had changed the country’s name ‘Sinhale’ into Sri Lanka should also be investigated. (Lahiru Pothmulla)WATCH
