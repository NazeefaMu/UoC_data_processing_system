Question that stumped him


	



 

This story comes from a Blue party source. There is a certain firebrand Diyawanna member hailing from a political family in Raigam Korale. 

 


He is known to be following a simple lifestyle and going about barefooted.


This worthy came face to face with the Number One in yahapalanaya at the Diyawanna council the other day. After briefly exchanging niceties, the duo discussed the latest political developments as well. The firebrand member, after explaining his take on certain topical issues, suddenly fired this question at Number One: “Sir, why on earth did you assign this key portfolio to that ‘gon-batalaya’ (a derogatory term usually used to describe a big-made dim-witted person)? Man has now become a big curse!”


Number One replied: “I can understand that. But the problem is that fellow doesn’t!”


Having given that cryptic reply, Number One quietly left the place. 


The Diyawanna member left for Horana to attend a public function in that area.
