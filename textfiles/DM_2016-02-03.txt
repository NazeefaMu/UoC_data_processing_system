A double track line and a suspected double game
	

It has been decided to lay a new double track railway line between two historic towns in Rajarata.

A certain yahapalanaya purohita is the livewire behind the project, they say.
There is already a single track line connecting these two historic towns and the train services on this line are now restricted to only two or three runs up and down for a day.
Technical experts who had done a feasibility study have reported that the proposed double-track line project would cost several billions of US dollars. Meanwhile, railway trade union leaders are up in arms saying that the proposed new project would push the department already incurring massive losses into worse financial straits.
However, the politico is dead set on going ahead with the project for gaining political mileage. And the trade union activists are now getting ready to tell the country what the motive behind the politicos unusual interest about the double-track railway line project, they say.

Cleansing the party ahead of local polls
	

The new Big Boss is set to appoint new electorate organizers for the party he leads. And most Diyawanna members now paying Pooja to the former strongman are to get the chop in the process, they say.

The Big boss has already given the red light to these dissident members by overlooking them in the matter of appointing authorities to the electorate level development committees. He will next proceed to replace the current party organizers at two or three selected places.
Of the party organizers loyal to the former strongman, the first to get the walking papers will be a stalwart from a political family in the Gampaha area. This politico is said to be highly inspired by an astrological prediction that he is a potential main purohita of the country. He is to be replaced by one of his siblings as the electorate organizer.
The tuition master now functioning as the partys organizer for Homagama is to be replaced either by the lesser known Tilakasiri or the better known megapolis pilot, they say. However, it is a cinch that the tuition master is out of the picture.

Diyawanna seat too is to be restored to him
	

The government authorities in the highest echelons are inundated with requests these days regarding filling the vacant Lands portfolio and the national list seat, they say.

The most pressing requests have come from the family of a yahapalanaya purohita.
This purohita who was among the first to raise the battle cry for yahapalanaya has urged that the Field Marshall be nominated to fill the vacant national list Diyawanna seat and also be appointed to the vacant portfolio. However, the purohitas son, now a Diyawanna member, has insisted that a certain Soysa be offered the vacant Diyawanna seat in accord with a pre-election agreement signed with the Green party and he be appointed to the vacant portfolio. This has, incidentally, led to a dispute between the duo living under the same roof.
Meanwhile, the Big Boss and the second in command of yahapalanaya have reportedly decided on the Field Marshall as the best choice for the vacant national list Diyawanna seat. So the much respected old soldier is expected to return to Diyawanna wearing a new mantle shortly.

Dulanjalee Premadasa tells MR where to get off
	
Dulanjalee Premadasa, the daughter of former president R. Premadasa, in a hard hitting letter addressed to former president Mahinda Rajapaksa yesterday, said the latter should not drag her name to a case in which she was not accused of
"You are well aware that I am innocent. You seem to think that you have a right to play around with my name when you have run out of excuses. This is unacceptable and dishonourable. If you are a credible lawyer you should know that I am not an accused and that this particular matter is an on-going court case and, as such, legally we cannot discuss it. Even you, now, must adhere to the law of our country." she said, responding to statement made by Mr. Rajapaksa that he did not get anyone in the opposition arrested during his time even if they had charges against them. Mr Rajapaksa had said this citing an incident where forged currency notes were allegedly found in Ms. Premadasa's possession.
"I may sympathise with your circumstances; but when you start dragging my good name in to the mud, when I am not involved in any of your present political problems, my sympathy turns to disgust. You were our former Executive President, yet you slander me without any basis, simply because your son has been arrested." she said in her letter.
"My revered parents President Premadasa and Mrs Hema Premadasa, did a stellar job in raising my brother and myself to respect and uphold the law of God and the law of the Land. I did not need your supposed advice about leading an upright lifestyle because my parents carried out that duty brilliantly. You should advise your children as their parent about leading their lives in a manner which befits their position in society," she said. (Yohan Perera)
Mr. Mahinda Rajapaksa,
Member of Parliament
Carlton House
Tangalle

Mr Rajapaksa,
First let me say that, as a parent myself, I empathize with your wife and yourself on Yoshitha's current legal status. Having said that I do not know whether Yositha is guilty or innocent until the court decides. Since it is an on going legal case I prefer not to refer to it in any way.
Mr Rajakaksa, I may sympathize with your circumstances but when you start dragging my good name in to the mud, when I am not involved in any of your present political problems, is when my sympathy turns to disgust. You were our former Executive President, but yet you slander me without any basis, simply because your son has been arrested.
I remember during the last General Election you resorted to doing the same. I did not arrest your son Mr. Rajapaksa, nor did I make you lose the election, you did it all by yourself with the help of your family.
My revered parents President Premadasa and Mrs Hema Premadasa, did a stellar job in raising my brother and myself to respect and uphold the law of God and the law of the Land. I did not need your supposed advice about leading an upright lifestyle because my parents carried out that duty brilliantly. You should advice your children as their parent about leading their lives in a manner, whichbefits their position in society.
My brother and I were also a Prime Minister's children and an Executive President's children who never even imagined abusing our positions . Young as we were , our mother always reminded us that our father was a public servant while holding the offices of Prime Minister and President.
Mr Rajapaksa, you are well aware as I that I am innocent . You seem to think that you have a right to play around with my name when you have run out of excuses. This is unacceptable and dishonourable. If you are a credible lawyer you should know that I am not an accused and that this particular matter is an on-going court case and as such legally we cannot discuss it. Even you, now, must adhere to the law of our country.
My late father's service and dedication to this country is unparalleled to any of his predecessors or successors. Whether you agree or not is of no importance. I know you attempted to match my late father's achievements and the few instances I have briefly spoken with you, if you recall, I have said that you were not even close to achieving it but I had commended you on your attempts to serve our country and stop the war. Let me remind you that you were successful in ending the war because your predecessors had laid the foundation for you to do so. Do I need to remind you that my dear father was assassinated by the LTTE  To date my late father is the highest ranking Sri Lankan who was a victim of terrorists . This shocked the International Community so much that the support for the LTTE started to wane. This happened because President Premadasa lived and worked for the masses without hiding in ' palaces'.
Mr Rajapaksa, one must face situations and not hide behind baseless accusations directed at innocent people. I would like to request you to please uphold your dignity and desist from making such comments again. I am aware that this is not the first time you have done it and this is not the first time I have requested you not to do it. I sincerely hope and trust that this will be the last.
Whenever your childrens activities are questioned by legal authorities, press and the law abiding citizens of this country, it is not right for a former President like you to duck and dodge without giving viable explanations . All you have done recently is to throw mud at me. You told me personally then, that I was the victim of the crime and not the criminal.
Furthermore, your false and arrogant claims of your letting me free when according to you, I was wrong, tantamount to a serious crime which can place you in jail for interfering in the course of justice and a police investigation.
Finally, let me remind you again that this matter is before COURTS and is accordingly subjudice and any comment on this is liable for contempt of court.
Please convey my regards to Mrs Rajapaksa.
Dulanjalee Premadasa

FCID redundant, says Lakshman Yapa
	
The procedures of the Financial Crime Investigation Division (FCID) were not clear, the State Finance Minister Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena said today.
While addressing a media briefing the minister said, there were several financial fraud investigations in progress.
President Maithripala Sirisena has empowered the Presidential Commission of Inquiry to Investigate and Inquire into Serious Acts of Fraud, Corruption and Abuse of Power, State Resources and Privileges (PRECIFAC), while the Police Commission had been appointed and it had been given independent powers as well. These two Commissions are enough to conduct these investigations, the Minister said.
Institutions have now being established to investigate on bribery and corruption in a fair manner. It is better to not to go with instant procedures like the FCID investigations, which may create wrong public opinion.
There are specified procedures for investigations and the procedures should be communicated to the public in a proper way and we already have Government approved procedures, he said.(Chaturanga Pradeep)

First sexually transmitted Zika virus reported in US
	
The first sexually transmitted case of the Zika virus is confirmed in Dallas, in the United States.
This case in Dallas is very concerning, said Vanderbilt Chair of Preventative Medicine Dr. William Schaffner over the phone, we don't know if sexual transmission is common or rare. We don't know how long after contracting Zika you can transmit this virus to your partner.
But don't panic yet. The CDC said until now the more than 30 U.S. cases were all foreign travelers and there was no evidence that mosquitoes on American soil carry the virus. It has mostly been limited to South America and usually isn't that serious.
For the most part people get infected with the Zika virus and they never even know theyre infected. But a small portion of people will indeed develop fever, aches and pains and a rash, Schaffner said.
The exception to the mild effects: when women who are pregnant receive bites from infected mosquitoes. Doctors in Brazil are seeing a spike in infants with microcephaly, a birth defect that results in an abnormally small head and may be linked to the virus.
In 2015 4,000 cases were reported in Brazilian babies.
Im afraid the majority of these babies have very substantial limitations and those are limitations that will be with them for their lifetimes, Schaffner said.
The World Health Organization has called for an international effort to fight the virus.
Scientists in the forest where the virus got its name have been trapping mosquitoes for research, and a lab in England was testing genetically modified bugs whose larvae die before maturity as a form of population control.
Because, despite several teams working toward it, a vaccine may not appear for a while. Schaffner said research teams were trying to cram two years-worth of work into six months.
He suggested pregnant women stay away from the South and Central American countries that have been affected by the virus.
Others who chose to travel there should take precautions like staying inside, wearing long sleeves and pants and bug spray at all times.(newschannel5)

Green-turned-Blues appointment draws flak
	

There is a buzz in political circles that a Green-turnedBlue from Uva has been appointed the leader of the Diyawanna Blue group.

Some Blue party stalwarts had openly told the Big Boss at the Executive Committee meeting held the other day that they could not subscribe to this appointment. Even the former Madam who was present had asked the Boss why he made such a controversial appointment.
Amid the ongoing ho-ha about the appointment, the man from the Uva had begun praising the Big Boss for his achievements not forgetting to hurl an occasional acid remark at the Green party.
However, neither the praise heaped on the Big Boss nor the critical remarks made about his previous party softened the Blue members who had persisted with their opposition to the Uva turncoat being appointed as their group leader.
The Big Boss had finally agreed to reconsider the appointment and dismissed the subject saying: Now let us proceed with the next item on the agenda.

Dont you know that I have not been appointed to the Central Committee under yahapalanaya was the rejoinder of the former boss. The former strongman had continued: I, who liberated this country is not in the Central Committee but the organizers who lost at the poll after working for the victory of the `elephant have been appointed as members. And I have been appointed to the Executive Committee which is a body at a lower rung.

Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa said he would not deviate from the path of reasserting national independence, ensuring the territorial integrity, restarting the stalled process of economic development and re-establishing national self respect even if he and his entire family was imprisoned.
In his National Independence Day message, Ex-president Rajapaksa said since 8 January 2015, Sri Lankans were again being used by foreign powers for their purposes and that the separatists, who could not achieve their aims after nearly four decades of terrorism, now hope to achieve their aim with the help of these foreign powers.
Since last year there has been an unending procession of foreign dignitaries visiting their latest conquest. Due to the influence of these foreign powers, dangerous LTTE detainees have been released and members of the armed forces have been arrested under the Prevention of Terrorism Act. Furthermore, plans are afoot to prosecute our war heroes for war crimes, he said.
Mr. Rajapaksa said leaders of several foreign funded NGOs had met leaders of the present government and insisted on the arrest of members of his government on corruption charges before February 4 this year.
My son Yoshitha, my Press Secretary Rohan Welivita, Nishantha Ranatunga and two directors of the CSN TV Channel Ravinath Fernando and Kavishan Dissanayake have been arrested under an omnibus provision in the Criminal Procedure Code enabling the police to arrest individuals to conduct investigations, he said.

The main political party in the North is on the verge of an implosion, they say.

Meanwhile, the battle between the party leader nurtured in the old political school and the chief purohita for the North, now a radical, fuelled by interested parties abroad is fast growing in intensity, they say.
Observers say that the main North-East party leader who had been espousing moderate views on the issue of power devolution has suddenly shifted his stance to nothing short of federalism in a bid to protect his political survival. Even his second in command Mavai who had fearlessly taken on the chief purohita in the past is now observing a studied silence, they say. All present indications are that the radicals led by upstarts like the chief purohita of the North are fast gaining ground at the expense of the old school band. Meanwhile, yahapalanaya high ups have come to harbour fears that this new development in the North could upset the governments plans to bring about the proposed Constitutional reforms with the support of the minorities.

A story was also afloat that moves were being made to appoint a onetime insider who once disappeared with a file containing vital documents.
Meanwhile, voices raised in the august assembly insisted that whoever to be appointed to this key post should be a person of integrity with impeccable credentials.
There also had been a suggestion that a well-qualified officer ranking third or the fourth in the seniority order in the department be raised to this high office after promoting his seniors to suitable positions in the judicial service.
Meanwhile, the Constitutional Council has decided not to extend the acting period of the officer currently covering up the duties of the head of this legal department.

We dont know who these investors are or the sources of their income whether they are investing black money or LTTE Diaspora money here. As representatives of Parliament, which has the authority to make decisions on funds of the government, we have a right to know who these investors are.

Next Police Chief: An insider with an academic background
	

The battle over the main chair in the Police department is going ding-dong these days.

Although the battle is said to be four-cornered, there is only one aspirant putting up a real spirited fight, they say.
The spirited fighter bent on grabbing the coveted chair by hook or by crook is wooing not only the support of the powerful political figures here but also that of certain influential expatriates in distant France,they say.

However, the stark reality is that the hopefuls are battling for this chair in vain, because those in the highest echelons have already decided on the appointee, they say. This columnist can offer a hint pointing to the lucky person: He is a scholar with an academic background and credentials in the field of public administration. He already holds a high position in the Police.

SF joins UNF
	
The Democratic Party (DP) led by Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka on Wednesday joined the United National Front (UNF) after signing an MoU with the UNP- the leading party of the alliance.
Though there were strong speculation that Field Marshal Fonseka was to be appointed to Parliament to fill the vacancy created by the demise of Minister M K. A. D. S. Gunawardene and would be given a Ministerial portfolio, both parties said no final decision had been taken on these matters.
It was reported that the decision to appoint Fonseka as an MP would be taken at the UNP Working Committee, expected to meet on February 8, 2016.
Premier Wickremesinghe, who spoke after the signing, said talks with the DP began in December last year and the MoU, was to be signed in January but had to be postponed as he had to go out of the country.
Meanwhile, Mr. Wickremesinghe went on to say that a certain group had requested the people not to hoist the national flag to celebrate independence.
He questioned as to what flag the countrymen should hoist on the Independence Day.
Do they want people to hoist the Eelam Flag he questioned.
Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka said his party had decided to join the UNF alliance led by the UNP to launch a programme to introduce a decent political culture and to establish a system of good governance.
We were on a long journey to achieve these goals earlier as we did not want to take shortcuts, but now we have decided to go on this journey with a leading political party, he said.
Besides he said it was no point allying with the UPFA as its symbol, the betel leaf is spoiled by pests. (Yohan Perera)

SLMA wants organ transplant guidelines and procedures strengthened
	
The Sri Lanka Medical Association (SLMA) urged the Ministry of Health and other key stakeholders to strengthen current guidelines and procedures for organ transplant programmes including the implementation of the National Organ Donor Programme for Deceased Donor Organ Transplants.
The SLMA said in a statement it was important to strengthen the capacity of ethics committees in hospitals to implement these guidelines and monitor these programmes, which would serve as a deterrent to trafficking of human organs, for the purpose of transplantation in Sri Lanka. 
The Sri Lanka Medical Association (SLMA) is concerned about the references made against some members of the medical profession in litigation initiated in India pertaining to certain kidney transplants on Indian nationals carried out in Sri Lanka. The report of the inquiring committee appointed by the Ministry of Health will shed more light on this matter, the SLMA said.
The statement said that all organ transplants carried out in Sri Lanka were authorised by the Ministry of Health.

Sri Lankan convicted in Germany for backing LTTE
	
A Sri Lankan-born man received an 18-month suspended sentence in Germany on Tuesday (Feb 2) for membership of the rebel group the Tamil Tigers which Germany considers a terrorist organisation.
The 53-year-old German national, identified only as Yogendran G. by the court in the northern city of Hamburg, was convicted of having raised funds in Germany from 2007-2009 for the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).
The LTTE committed a string of attacks against civilian targets and national infrastructure during Sri Lanka's decades-long civil war that killed more than 100,000 people and ended in 2009 when government forces crushed the rebels.
The Hamburg court found that the man raised more than 81,000 euros ($88,000) for combat and terrorist activities including suicide attacks by the LTTE in its campaign for a separate Tamil homeland in the South Asian country.
The accused, who said he had been a German citizen since 2007, opted not to testify on the opening day of the trial on Jan 18.
But a court spokesman said on Tuesday that he had later partially confessed in court to the charges against him, admitting to "collecting and transferring the funds" to the LTTE.
The court, however, ruled that he was more than a member and actually "bore responsibility" within the group.
The prosecution and the defendant have one week to decide whether to appeal the verdict.
German authorities estimate that more than 1,000 LTTE supporters live in the country, mainly doing propaganda work and organising donation drives.- AFP

Those who oppose FCID have skeletons in their cupboards
	
Those who call for the abolition of the Financial Crimes Division (FCID) and most of those who have visited former Presidents son Yoshitha in prison are ones who should be behind bars, Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) said today.
JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake told a media briefing that the deputy ministers who claimed that the FCID was illegal and should be abolished are ones who have been involved in various corrupt deals.
"These people have got scared after Yoshithas arrest because they have skeletons in their cupboards," he said.
Mr. Dissanayake said Yoshitha was arrested on money laundering charges and most of those who oppose his arrest were ones who raised their hands to approve the legislation banning money laundering.
Those who visited Yoshitha should be in prison with him.The FCID is currently under the IGP and he had informed that no one can be arrested without the approval of the Attorney General, he said.
Mr. Dissanayake said Yoshithas arrest wasin no way an act of political victimization because there are serious charges against him of abusing state property.
He said the Rs.120 million which the CSN officials were unable to account for was really public funds.
Mr. Dissanayake said these properties should be confiscated.
