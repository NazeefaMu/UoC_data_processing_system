Perceptual Treasuries Chief Arjun Aloysius offered me money in 2015 but I refused to accept it, Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake said yesterday.

Mr. Ramanayake told a media briefing that he was among many MPs who were offered money by the Perpetual Treasuries Chief.

“I was offered money by Aloysius but I refused to accept saying I don’t want to associate with them,” he sai

"JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake and I were the only two MPs who had refused to accept money from Aloysius,” he added. The Deputy Minister was a member of the Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) in Parliament which carried out a probe on it.

Mr. Ramanayake said prominent members of clergy belonging to all four main religions, journalists, artistes, MPs, provincial and local politicians were among the 118 persons who had obtained money from Perceptual Treasuries Chief. He said he learnt this from reliable sources.

“Those who don’t criticize former Minister Dayasiri Jayasekera who had been charged with obtaining money from Perceptual Treasuries Chief are the ones who have also taken money from Aloysius. Former Minister Ravi Karunanayake was asked to comment on Dayasiri Jaysekera but he had refused to do so. Only Bandulalal Bandarigoda and few others have criticized Mr Jayasekera and I ask the MPs in my own party to criticize Mr. Jayasekera and prove their innocence,” he said. He said the criticism made by SLPP Chairman Prof. G L Peiris was commendable.

He also said Mr. Jayasekera should return the one million rupees to Aloysius.

Further he said Aloysius and Palisena are revealing details of the people to whom they gave money from prison.

Meanwhile, President Maithripala Sirisena assured me that he would soon reveal those who got into deals with the corrupt right from January 8, 2018, Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake said yesterday.

Mr. Ramanayake the President made this assurance when speaking to him over the telephone last morning. “President called me after seeing the statement I made last week that those who pledged to arrest the corrupt within 24 hours of coming to power but gave helicopters for them to get away. He told me that he was not involved in those matters. I told him to make a public statement and disclose everything to the people. Therefore he agreed to make a public statement and disclose everything,” Mr. Ramanayake said.

The Deputy Minister said the President also instructed him to send application to his office asking for the names of 118 persons who had obtained cheques from Perceptual Treasuries Chief Arjun Aloysius under Right to information Bill (RTI) and he had already sent an application.

“ I hope the Prime Minister will also make a statement and reveal everything to the people,” he also said. (Yohan Perera)
