Inauguration of the solar energy system at the Sampath Bank Colombo Super branch
Solar energy system installed at Colombo super branch in Dharmapala Mawatha In line with one of its core CSR pillars, ‘Environment Protection a n d C o n s e r v a t i o n ’ , Sampath Bank, renowned as a responsible corporate citizen, installed its first solar energy system at the Sampath Bank Colombo super branch in Dharmapala Mawatha. The bank ceremonially inaugurated the installation of its first Solar System at the Colombo super branch premises on December 03rd 2015.
Commenting on the initiative Sampath Bank Chief Operating Officer Nanda Fernando, said: “At Sampath Bank we take our sustainability goals to the heart of our business. W h i l s t i n v e s t i n g i n initiatives that protect and conserve the environment, we’ve taken steps to i n t e g r a t e s u s t a i n a b l e practices in carrying out our business. Installing our very first Solar Energy System is therefore yet another step taken by the bank in venturing into a new dimension of adopting environmentally friendly energy sources”.
“I want to also express my gratitude to the team of experts from Genso Power Technologies who offered their services to make yet another one of our sustainability operations a success. Based on the performances of this pilot installation, we hope to equip several other branch outlets with energy solar systems within the next year,” he added. Sampath Bank’s solar energy system possesses the ability to generate almost fifty megawatt hours (50,000kWh) of clean and green energy to the national grid. Covering two third of day time energy usage of the bank premises, this solar system will create a comfortable and a refreshing banking environment for the Sampath employees and customers. Further, the solar energy system reduces the carbon emissions to the atmosphere by thirty metric tonnes (30MT) annually, which is equivalent to planting almost 200 trees on soil.
This environmental benefit further fulfills the bank’s passion to protect and conserve the environment whilst contributing to reduce the impact made on ecosystems, climate change, health and quality of life, economic growth and environmental sustainability.
