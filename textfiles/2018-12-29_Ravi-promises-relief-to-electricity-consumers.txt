Power and Energy Minister Ravi Karunanayake said yesterday that electricity consumers would be provided with relief after the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) becomes a profitable venture.

He said this during a discussion with representatives of 58 CEB trade unions held at the ministry yesterday morning.

The minister assured them that he would resolve many problems that had cropped up within the CEB shortly and requested the trade unions to cooperate by leaving their personnel objectives behind.
