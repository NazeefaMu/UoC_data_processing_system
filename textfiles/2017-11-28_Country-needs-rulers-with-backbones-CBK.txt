While claiming that there should be a philosophy for the rulers to develop the country in addition to a clear proramme to implement it, former President Chandrika Kumaratunga on Sunday said 'there should be leaders who should have a backbone to implement the programmes at a time when the challenges exist in the society.'

Addressing an event in Veyangoda the former President also said: There should be a philosophy for the rulers to develop the country. That philosophy is not for my benefits, nor for filling the pockets of myself and my siblings. Our philosophy should be a programme that helps us to develop the country. We should have a clear programme to implement it. It is not only philosophy that is required but the programme to implement it. There should be leaders who should have backbones to implement the programmes at a time when the challenges exist in the society like this. We want not only one leader but also the officers in the hierarchy from the Cabinet of Ministers to Pradeshiya Sabhas. They should think in terms of the welfare and the development of the country."

She also said that some are saying to handover the country to them just because of winning the war. "But three fourth of the war was won by me and my Government. See the indecent stories fabricated in this regard. Why can’t we develop the country? The crux of the question lies there. The whole treasury had become empty. They have robbed the country and now they have begun to corrupt the country.”
