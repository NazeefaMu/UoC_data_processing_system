Champion swimmer gets IOC/WASA scholarship

The International Olympic Committee and World Aquatic Sports Association has awarded a scholarship worth 10,000 US Dollars to Matthew Abeysinghe for clinching the award for fastest swimmer in South Asia and winning seven gold medals at the recently concluded South Asian Games in Guwahati, India.
The scholarship covers training sessions, sports equipment, coach's allowances, vitamins and nourishment.
The IOC has agreed to grant this scholarship on a special request made by the National Olympic Committee of Sri Lanka.
Abeysinghe expects to get the maximum out of the scholarship and surpass the qualifying standards for the Rio Olympics in August this year.
He will participate in the Dubai Swimming Championship and Malaysian Swimming Championship in April, and Japan Open Swimming Championship in May to get the much needed foreign exposure. His father cum coach Manoj Abeysinghe said that Matthew had to take part in 11 disciplines with the intention of winning maximum number of medals for the country and the effort he put in deprived him of concentrating on his pet events and gaining the qualifying standards for the Rio Olympics.
Manoj Abeysinghe said that he was grateful to Chairman of the National Olympic Committee Hemasiri Fernando, Secretary Maxwell de Silva and former secretary of the Aquatic Sports Association Akri Ameer for their efforts in obtaining this scholarship for his son.
