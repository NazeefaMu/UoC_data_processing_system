The Bribery Commission today filed a corruption case against former Chief Justice Mohan Peiris, former Solicitor General and currently Court of Appeal Judge A.H.M.D. Navas and Lanka Electricity Company Secretary M.M.C. Ferdinandes in the Colombo Chief Magistrate's Court.

The case was filed on charges of preparing an erroneous Attorney General's report to avoid taking legal action on irregularities connected with the lands purchased for LECO during the period December 1 and 30 in 2010 when Mohan Peiris was the Attorney General.

The Bribery Commission said the suspects had prepared an erroneous report to prevent certain officers at LECO being charged in a criminal case.

Subsequently, Colombo Chief Magistrate Lal Ranasinghe Bandara noticed the suspects to appear before courts on March 8 over the case. (Shehan Chamika Silva)
