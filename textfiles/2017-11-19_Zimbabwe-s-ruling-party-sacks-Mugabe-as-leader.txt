Zimbabwe's ruling party Zanu-PF has sacked Robert Mugabe as its leader, BBC reported a short while ago.

It has appointed former vice-president Emmerson Mnangagwa - sacked by Mr Mugabe two weeks ago - as leader.

The sacking of Mr Mnangagwa had prompted an extraordinary chain of events as the military intervened to block Mr Mugabe, 93, from installing his wife Grace in his place.

Tens of thousands of Zimbabweans attended street protests on Saturday to demonstrate against the Mugabes.

Mr Mugabe is set to meet military leaders on Sunday and a motorcade has been seen leaving his private residence.
