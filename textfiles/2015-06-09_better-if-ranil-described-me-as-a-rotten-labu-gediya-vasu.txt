Firebrand parliamentarian Vasudeva Nanayakkara, who commented on the exchange of words between him and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has said it would have been better if the Prime Minister described him a rotten 'labu gediya’ instead of a rotten pumpkin.
Mr. Nanayakkara had made this comment during an interview with the Deshaya newspaper.Question: What do you think of the Prime Minister describing you as a rotten pumpkin s?Answer: I can’t understand what he meant. I could understand if he called me a rotten 'labu gediya'. But then I wondered whether the UNP was looking for pumpkins for its ‘mala batha’ (post-funeral meal) because pumpkins are usually in demand for this meal.
