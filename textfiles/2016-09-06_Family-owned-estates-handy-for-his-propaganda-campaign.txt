A senior JO stalwart has launched a poster and banner blitz in his district following his removal from the electoral organizer post.




Banners, posters and hoardings carrying a large picture of the politico under the bold legend, ‘Aragalaye Ruwanpura Nayakaya – Api Oba Samagai’ (Ruwanpura Leader of the Struggle – We are with you) have come up practically everywhere in the district, mostly on the estates owned by the members of the politico’s family.
