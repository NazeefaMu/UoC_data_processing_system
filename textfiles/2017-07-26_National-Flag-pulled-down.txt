An unidentified individual who came by a motorcar is alleged to have pulled down the national flag raised at the Vavuniya District Secretariat premises yesterday morning. Police said only one individual came by the car. When the police officials on duty at the District Secretariat ordered him to stop the car he had attempted to knock them down and escaped arrest.

Vavuniya Police visited the scene and initiated investigations after the District Secretary M.B.R. Pushpakumara complained in this regard. Later the officials of the District Secretariat had taken steps to fly the national flag again.(Romesh Madusanka)
