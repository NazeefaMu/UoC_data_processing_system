Sampath Ath Pavura to Nurture Nation’s Social Entrepreneurs


	

Sampath Bank joined hands with the pioneering initiative of Lanka Impact Investing Network, Social Enterprise Lanka and Independent Television Network (ITN) to promote social entrepreneurship and Impact Investing in Sri Lanka. The Bank has stepped in as the Lead and the Title Sponsor of the second edition of Ath Pavura, the first reality TV show promoting social entrepreneurs in the nation.

The show, which is broadcasted on ITN, offers them a much needed platform to pitch their new social business ideas or existing social businesses to a panel of Impact Investors. The judging panel will determine whether the contestants should be granted the investment they seek and, if so, will award it to them, right there. It also allows these social entrepreneurs to take their ideas to a wider audience through national television.

This partnership is part of Sampath Bank’s continued efforts to promote entrepreneurship across the island. The Bank has stood by entrepreneurs, especially those from the Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) sector, right from its inception. Going beyond offering financial support, it continues to reach out to them through the ‘Sampath Saviya’ entrepreneurship development program. Offering technical support and skills development, the Bank has nurtured over 2,000 Micro, Small and Medium Scale Enterprises (MSMEs) through this initiative. Sampath Bank also hosts “Saviyaka Abhiman” SME fairs to provide Sampath Saviya entrepreneurs with a platform to showcase their products and services to a wider audience.

“Right from its inception, Sampath Bank has stood by the nation’s entrepreneurs, offering them much more than just financial support to help them grow and thrive. We believe that Social Enterprises have a strong role to play in helping solve social, environmental and economic problems and that their efforts and impact can be augmented further with the support of established businesses and other relevant stakeholders,” said Mr. Tharaka Ranwala, Senior Deputy General Manager – Consumer Banking, Sampath Bank PLC. “In line with this, we are delighted to join hands with Lanka Impact Investing Network, Social Enterprise Lanka and ITN for the current edition of Ath Pavura. We look forward to engaging and supporting the participants at this forum and being inspired by their path breaking ideas.”
