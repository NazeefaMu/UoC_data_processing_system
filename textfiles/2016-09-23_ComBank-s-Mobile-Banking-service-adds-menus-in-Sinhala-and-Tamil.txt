ComBank’s Mobile Banking service adds menus in Sinhala and Tamil


	

Users of Commercial Bank’s Mobile Banking facility now have a choice of menus in transliterated Sinhala and Tamil, following an enhancement of the platform by Sri Lanka’s largest private bank.
Available on the USSD (Unstructured Supplementary Service Data) version of the bank’s Mobile Banking service, these menus contain Sinhala and Tamil words written in English text for users who are more familiar with vernacular terminology.


Available to mobile phone users on the Dialog, Mobitel and Etisalat networks, Commercial Bank’s easy to access menu-driven USSD-based mobile banking service offers greater convenience and functionality, enabling users to carryout numerous banking transactions including account balance and credit card balance inquiries, utility bill payments, credit card settlements, fund transfers between own accounts, exchange rate inquiries, PIN changes, mobile reloads and requests for mini statements.


Because these services are offered on the USSD platform, they can be accessed from any mobile hand set. 
An Internet connection or special software is not required to access the service. Customers who wish to use the Mobile Banking service simply fill in an application form at a Commercial Bank branch and receive a password together with instructions on activation and operation of the facility.
