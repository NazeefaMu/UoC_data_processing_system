Entire Pment to be Govt. after polls
	
	The entire Parliament will be converted into a government after the next general election and it would not be a government of one party alone, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said yesterday.
	Addressing a ceremony organized by his alma mater Royal College Colombo to felicitate him and other ministers who were old boys of the school, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said the whole Parliament would be converted into a government that would run the country for five years.
	"Many ask me whether the UNP would form a government alone or if it would form an administration with the SLFP or whether it would form an anti Mahinda government. But my answer is that we will turn the entire Parliament into a government," he said.
	Mr. Wickremesinghe said the all-party government would rule the country for five years and then whoever got a majority at a general election held after five years would rule the country next.
	"We will get together and build the nation in five years and make Sri Lanka the best country in Asia," he said.
	We will build a future for every student in the country, he told the children.
	"I have returned to the school of our fathers for the third time. I first did it twenty years ago and then returned to school after eight years. It took me ten yeas to come to school as the Prime minister," he added.
	He recalled distinguished Royal College old boys such as the late Anagarika Dharmapala and J R Jayawardene and a host of others who had played outstanding roles in shaping the country.
	Ministers Lakshman Kiriella, Sajith Premadasa, Rauff Hakeem, D M Swaminathan, Gayantha Karunatilleke, Ravi Karunanayake and Deputy Minister Harsha de Silva were present at the ceremony. The presence of opposition MPs Dinesh Gunawardane and TNA MP M. A. Sumanthiran was a notable feature at the ceremony. (Yohan Perera)

	Following recent social media reports that MP Namal Rajapaksa owned a luxury watch collection, the former Presidents son denied owning more than two watches.
	When contacted by the Daily Mirror, Mr. Rajapaksa said that these were simply rumours that were circulating on social media and websites.
	I dont own such a luxury watch collection. I own just two watches and they were also gifts from family and friends. I have not bought myself a watch for several years now, he said.
	Commenting on the photos that seem to show him wearing at least eight different luxury watches on different occasions, amounting to several millions of rupees, he said they were fabricated photos.
	In all these photos, it is the same watch that I am wearing. But they have made it seem like they are different.

NPC resolution a blow to national harmony: JHU
	
Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) said today the Northern Provincial Councils approval of a resolution calling for an international investigation into alleged war crimes during the last stages of the war was a huge blow to the countrys unity, harmony and reconciliation.
JHU National Organiser Nishantha Sri Warnasinghe told a news conference that the LTTE should be held responsible if the human rights of the Tamil people were violated or for the damage caused during the war because it was the LTTE that used Tamil civilians as human shields.
The Tamil people were deprived of their right to participate in elections by the LTTE. But they were able to cast their vote at the January 8 presidential electionfor the first time after 1982 even though some groups such as the Tamil Diaspora conspired with the former government to carry out a boycott of the election by the Tamils in the North and East. Certain separatist groups are using this resolution to create divisions between the Sinhalese and the Tamils, he said.
Mr. Warnasinghe said the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) should join the all-party government without isolating the Tamil people.(Ajith Siriwardana)

Prison Hospital not only for VIPs: Prisons Chief
	
Newly appointed Acting Prisons Commissioner General Rohana Pushpakumara said the fair use of Prisons Hospital facilities would be available for every inmate irrespective of their background and the prison hospital was the privy of VIPs sentenced of remanded for various offences.
Mr. Pushpakumara assumed duties as the Acting Commissioner General of Prisons succeeding former Commissioner General Chandraratne Pallegama who was appointed Commandant of the Civil Defense Force last week.
Mr. Pushpakumara told the Daily Mirror there was a trend at present where high-profiled individuals who were impose a jail sentence or ordered to be remanded sought the refuge in the Prison Hospital.
Most of the VIPs were often directed to the Prison Hospital by the Judges who have remanded or sentenced them following appeals submitted by their attorneys.
But the same privileges should be provided to regular inmates who are languishing in jail for years while suffering from various illnesses like tuberculosis and blood pressure, Mr. Pushpakumara said.
He had earlier served as Human Resources Commissioner in the Prisons Department and appointed as the Acting Commissioner General by the Justice Ministry Secretary until Cabinet approves a permanent appointment.

Stop Indian trawlers from entering SL: Maithri to ask Modi
	
Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena is expected to ask Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to stop Indian trawlers from entering Lankan waters when he meets the latter in New Delhi on February 16.
The Lankan line on the fishing issue was discussed at a high level meeting held here on Thursday, in which the participants were President Sirisena, Northern Province Chief Minister C.V.Wigneswaran, Northern Province Governor HMGS Palihakkara, Eastern Province Governor and Austin Fernando, Deputy Minister of Defense Ruwan Wijewardene, the Navy Commander and B.Deniswaran, Northern Provincial Minister of Fisheries.
Deniswaran told the media that Sirisena will point out that trawlers from Tamil Nadu and Puduchery have been denuding the Palk Strait and Palk Bay of aquatic resources and denying North Lankan Tamil fishermen their livelihood. They should therefore be banned from coming here.
Wigneswaran said that India should take steps to ban trawling in the shallow sea between the two countries and encourage its fishermen to take to deep sea fishing in the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea.
On the persistent Indian suggestion that Indian boats be licensed to fish in Lankan waters with a view to regulating them, the Northern Provinces view was that no intrusion, whether licensed or not, should be allowed.On Releasing Boats
North Lankan fishermen have not taken kindly to the release of 87 detained Indian boats.
It is only a political drama to improve ties between Lanka and India. It will not solve our problem, which arises from massive poaching and trawling. Before releasing the boats, the intruders should have been warned that if they came again, their boats would be seized and not returned, said Rajachandran, President, Karainagar Ambal Fishermen's Co-Op Society.
We should release the poor fishermen on board, but detain the boats. After all, TN trawlers are owned by big capitalists. They need not be let off the hook, argued Subramaniam, President, Madakal West Grameeya Fishermen's Society.Politics of the Issue
This is the first time the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) is taking up the issue of Northern Tamil fishermen vis--vis Indian intruders. So far, only the Eelam Peoples Democratic Party (EPDP) led by Douglas Devananda has been voicing their concerns. The TNA has been wary of taking up the issue so as not to alienate India and Tamil Nadu.
But with Lankan parliamentary elections due in June, the TNA feels the need to expand its base. While it took up the issue of genocide to take the wind out of the sails of the radical Tamils, it has taken the issue of fishermen to take the wind out of the sails of the EPDP.
The Sirisena government is going along with the TNA on the fishermens issue to cement its new-found ties with it, ahead of the parliamentary elections. (New Indian Express)

SLFP General Secretary Anura Priyadharshana Yapa said the partys executive council which is also to be attended by former Presidents Chandrika Bandaranaike and Mahinda Rajapaksa will take the final decision on these matters.
We have sent invitations to all council members asking them to attend Saturdays meeting. We didnt discuss any matters connected to the prime ministerial candidate for the upcoming general elections, Mr. Yapa told journalists at the party headquarters in Colombo. 
When asked about the views of the party with regard to some United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) members proposing former President Rajapaksa as the UPFAs prime ministerial candidate, he said the SLFP had not received any invitation from any party for a discussion on such a topic.
 
SLFP is the main constituent of the UPFA but we havent had discussions on the prime ministerial candidate. Our priorities at this point are party reforms. We have ample time to make decisions on the election, he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla and Sanath Desmond)

	Secretary of State John Kerry
	And Foreign Minister of Sri Lanka Mangala Samaraweera
	Before Their Meeting
	Treaty Room
	Washington, D.C.
	SECRETARY KERRY: Good afternoon, everybody. Its my great pleasure to welcome Foreign Minister Samaraweera from Sri Lanka. And this is an exciting moment for all of us here because Sri Lanka on January 8th had an historic election in which there has been really a vote for change, a vote to move Sri Lanka in a new direction, to open up greater accountability and possibility for the preservation of human rights, for democracy, for fighting corruption and putting together a government that will speak for and to the people. And were particularly excited about the 100-day plan that the new government has put forward. We wish them well in the days ahead, and were going to talk today about President Sirisenas thoughts about how to move Sri Lanka away from 30 years of war with the Tamils to a country that is inclusive and prosperous and peaceful.
	And so Im happy to welcome the foreign minister of this new government here, and we look forward to working with him. Thank you.
	FOREIGN MINISTER SAMARAWEERA: Thank you. Thank you, Secretary of State Kerry, for the warm, cordial welcome. It is indeed a great pleasure for me to be here in Washington, and I come here at a time when Sri Lanka is going through a democratic revival and we have embarked on a very ambitious program, the 100-day program, as the Secretary just mentioned, which is a program of far-reaching democratic reforms and constitutional amendments. And we will also be giving pride of place to the reconciliation process because we believe a new Sri Lanka based on the principles of unity in diversity  the diversity of cultures, diversity of ethnic groups, and diversity of religions  will be the cornerstone of the new Sri Lanka we are envisaging.
	And we also hope to revive and strengthen the very strong bonds we have had with the United States for several decades, but of course, there have been  the relations have been somewhat strained given the last few years. And my job I feel is to ensure that we put back our relations to a irreversible state of excellence in the coming months, and I look forward to working very closely with Secretary of State Kerry and, of course, with the United States of America. For us, for the new administration, the United States of America is not a threat but a great opportunity. Thank you.
	SECRETARY KERRY: Thank you, my friend.
	FOREIGN MINISTER SAMARAWEERA: Thank you.
	SECRETARY KERRY: Thank you, sir. Thank you very much, everybody.
