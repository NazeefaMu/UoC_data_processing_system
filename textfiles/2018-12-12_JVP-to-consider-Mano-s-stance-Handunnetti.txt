While appreciating the statement made by Tamil Progressive Alliance (TPA) Leader and MP Mano Ganesan that his party’s stance to join JVP, MP Sunil Handunnetti said they would consider it.

Speaking to the Daily Mirror MP Handunnetti said the statement made by TPA leader in an audio message on Twitter was his personal view, but he had not officially communicated it to the JVP.

However, we respect his stance. As the JVP, we cannot make any statement regarding that statement now, he said.

MP Mano Ganesan yesterday posted an audio twitter message and said he was wondering whether his party should change its stance and join the Janatha Vimukthi Permanuna (JVP). (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)
