The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna today said it will lodged a complaint with the Secretariat for Committee on Eradication of Corruption and the Bribery Commission with regard to the new Rs 80 billion treasury bond scam on Wednesday.

JVP Former MP and Politburo Member Wasantha Samarasinghe told a media briefing that his party will lodge a complaint and call for a quick investigation on the issue.

“We will lodge a complaint with the Secretariat for Committee on Eradication of Corruption and the Bribery Commission as the Central Bank had continued its corrupt deals through the Rs 40 billion bond issue which ended up with Rs 80 billion. “ The bond issue was to raise Rs 40 billion but the Central Bank had ended up raising Rs 80 billion at the end,” Mr Samarasinghe said.

“The Central Bank had continued its corrupt deals through the governor’s son-in-law’s company and we have decided to lodged a complaint against the recent bond issue,” he added.

He said the working class had been directly affected by the bond issue this time.

“The Employee Provident Fund (EPF) is made to purchase bonds from primary dealers at a discount rate of one percent. This means that the interest rate which the EPF secures will be reduced by one percent.,” he said while stating that the EPF will lose Rs 80 million for each Rupees one billion it invests on treasury bonds.
