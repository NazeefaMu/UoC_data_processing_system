No one spoke of forming an alliance with the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) to contest at the local Government election as Minister Rajitha Senaratne only talked about trying to figure out a common list only in Beruwala, the United National Party (UNP) said yesterday.

This sentiment was expressed by Minister Gayantha Karunathilaka and MP Ajith Mannaperuma at a media briefing held in UNP headquarters Sirikotha last morning.

“Minister Senaratne only spoke about trying out a figure out a common list only in Beruwala and never spoke of a forming an alliance with the SLFP. “ UNP will contest the local government election with its allies as UNF,” Mr Karunatilleke said.

Meanwhile, the duo who spoke of the new Constitution said an extensive debate was held on the constitution in order to get as many proposals of political parties to the maximum.

“The all-party conference will also help gather as many proposals as possible as the objective of making the Constitution compiling process a joint effort of all parties. The MPs, therefore, said the constitutional assembly debate has not been an unwanted exercise,” Mr Manannpaeruma said. (Yohan Perera)
