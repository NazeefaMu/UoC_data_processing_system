David Pieris Motor Company Ltd (DPMC) and Assetline Leasing recently relocated their Jaffna branches, opening a ‘new world experience’ to their customers. 
The new DPMC sales office showcases a comprehensive range of Bajaj products and services, modern, efficient design and technology to provide greater convenience and accessibility to its customers. 
DPMC has the largest islandwide distribution network for an automotive company, which includes over 1500 sales and service dealers including 40 regional offices as part of the company’s commitment to support and assist customers no matter where they are based.
Products ranging from Bajaj motorcycles to three-wheelers are displayed at the showroom, which also features a ‘Partsmart’ spare parts vending machine, which gives the customers hassle-free, 24/7 access to frequently required genuine Bajaj parts. 
Assetline Leasing too has shifted its office with DPMC’s move in Jaffna to better providing its valued customers with hassle-free, quick and easy leasing solutions.
The new branch will provide leasing, finance and insurance of motorcycles, three-wheelers and all other registered and non-registered vehicles in addition to other regular leasing facilities offered by the company.
The DPMC regional sales office and Assetline Leasing branch are strategically located at No.61, Palaly Road, Jaffna to service the surrounding suburbs.
