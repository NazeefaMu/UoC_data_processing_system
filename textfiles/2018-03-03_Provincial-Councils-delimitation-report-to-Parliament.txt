The Local Government and Provincial Councils Ministry has sent a copy of the provincial councils delimitation report to the Secretary General of Parliament.

Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister Faizer Musthapha in a letter addressed to the Secretary General of Parliament through Leader of the House had said he had sent one copy of the report to the Parliament.

However he said in his letter that he would not be able to send 50 hard copies in all three languages and 350 soft copies as per section 3A (11) of Provincial Council Election Act No 2 of 1988 as the ministry was yet to receive the specified number of copies. He had assured that the rest of the copies would be sent as soon as they were ready.  (Yohan Perera)
