Yet another reshuffle!


	



 

According to a story that has come down the grapevine quite recently, yet another reshuffle of the big pack is around the corner.

 


Those due to be moved around this time round are mostly the Green ones in the pack and they include one or two grey-haired ones who have failed to prove their mettle. Kala Madam who recently drew much fire for making a statement considered politically blasphemous is also slated to be moved out and a suitable replacement is being looked for, they say.


Meanwhile, a rumour afloat says that a purohita who appointed family members to high office and another one handling a religious affair are to get the walking papers. 


By the way, of the 23 Diyawanna ones who have so far taken refuge in the Compassionate One, 22 have already got some high office or other and the odd man out, a prodigal son back home now is likely to get some good place in the coming reshuffle, they say.
