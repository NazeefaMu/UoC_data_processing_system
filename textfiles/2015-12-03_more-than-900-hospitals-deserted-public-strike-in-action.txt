Medical services in more than 900 hospitals have come to a standstill today due to the strike action launched by professionals in the medical sector.
Many professionals in the public sector including doctors, engineers, accountants and senior public servants are on a token strike today against certain budgetary decisions.
Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) today said at a media briefing that the action was in response to the budget cuts on government employees’ pension scheme and potential threats to public sector employees posed by CEPA (Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement), which they claimed to be signed in January.
GMOA Spokesman Dr. Navin de Soysa said health workers around 932 hospitals across the country including two national hospitals, 30 teaching hospitals, 18 district hospitals, 82 base hospitals and 800 other hospitals had not reported to work today.
However, he said as a result of the strike action, they would keep no room to harm a single patient and maternal and child care services.
He said emergency outpatient services would function as usual. (Piyumi Fonseka)
