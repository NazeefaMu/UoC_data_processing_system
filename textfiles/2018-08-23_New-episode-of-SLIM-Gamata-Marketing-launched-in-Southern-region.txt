The Sri Lanka Institute of Marketing (SLIM) in collaboration with the University of Ruhuna and INDECOS, commenced Fish Bonanza Phase II under the CSR project, ‘SLIM Gamata Marketing’ at the SLIM Matara branch with over 100 enthusiastic women entrepreneurs in the Southern Province participating.The event was graced by the two Vice Presidents of SLIM, Mr. Suranjith Swaris and Mr. Roshan Fernando. Dr. Nilantha Liyanage represented the University of Ruhuna, whilst Mr. Conrad Ranawake represented INDECOS. The Project Chair Ms. Kaushala Amarasekara, other distinguished guests and the staff of SLIM were also present at the ceremony.

The project was launched by SLIM in collaboration with the Department of Food Science and Technology of the Faculty of Agriculture at the University of Ruhuna and the Institute for Development of Community Strengths (INDECOS). HNB Grameen came on board as the Financial Partner of this project.  

As the national body for marketing, the Sri Lanka Institute of Marketing has identified a requirement for its intervention to promote the marketing philosophy among SMEs, rural enterprises and new entrepreneurs. This year ‘Gamata Marketing’ focuses on the fishing communities in Matara through ‘Fish Bonanza’. The project was initiated with the aim of educating regional fishing communities on marketing principles and its applications. The project will train selected candidates on the new technology and skills,make them aware of means by which to produce innovative products from fish, and provide them with product strategies coupled with marketing related knowledge. 

Pradeep Edward, the President – SLIM and CEO of Lanka Hospitals Diagnostics stated, “As the leading institute for marketing in Sri Lanka, SLIM is determined to elevate the status of marketing in the country by producing professional marketers incountry and bringing out their hidden talents. Here at SLIM we also stress upon social responsibility in our actions to uplift the economy and create a better society. SLIM has hence embarked on a CSR program branded ‘Gamata Marketing’, which focuses on the society, economy and environment of the country.”

Roshan Fernando, Vice President – SLIM, added, “’Gamata Marketing' was launched by SLIM with the aim of empowering the regional SMEs on marketing principles and the means by which to apply them effectively and efficiently to further develop their businesses. The project focuses on helping new entrepreneurs to compete in the market by delivering specific products and services to a wider market. This initiative will help to uplift their business performance and streamline their focus, attitudes and orientation towards market based products, which is the key to success in the marketing industry.”
Kaushala Amarasekara, the Project Chairperson of Gamata Marketing said, “The latest endeavour by SLIM, ‘Gamata Marketing’ aims to identify and uplift unseen entrepreneurs in rural areas and emphasize the importance of marketing. Women play a vital role as entrepreneurs in this society. They have an enormous capacity to indulge in sustainable businesses. Yet women living beyond urban and sub-urban areas of the country often lack education and exposure to the latest trends in the world. Thus, they are confined to conventional methods when engaging in business and household affairs. SLIM with ‘Gamata Marketing’ intends toprovide these women with business ideas, opportunities and also look forward to elevating the status of their living standards.” 

‘Gamata Marketing’ creates an opportunity to provide awareness to the rural stakeholders about the importance of marketing and its benefits to all individuals and thereby to the society. The project will bridge the gap between rural upcoming entrepreneurs and SLIM, which in turn will open a whole new world to the upcoming entrepreneurs. 

SLIM is the national body for marketing in Sri Lanka and has been promoting marketing excellence and elevating the status of marketing since 1970. Incorporated by the Parliament Act 41 of 1980 of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka.
