Former Minister Wimal Weerawansa and seventeen others have been summoned by the Presidential Commission of Inquiry to Investigate and Inquire into Serious Acts of Fraud, Corruption and Abuse of Power, State Resources and Privileges (PRECIFAC) over a financial fraud.

A spokesman for the commission said a complaint was received by the commission alleging that Mr. Weerawansa had given the approval to provide houses and shop spaces of the National Housing Development Authority (NHDA) at low rates incurring a loss of about Rs. 13.6 million to the government violating the NHDA Act in 2014.
