Kondaya to appear before The Human Right Commission

Dunesh Priyashantha alias ‘Kondaya’ is preparing to file a complaint against the CID before the Human Rights Commission for obtaining a false statement from him after forcefully attacking him. Accordingly, he is due to appear before the Sri Lanka's Human Right Commission (HRCSL) at 02.30 pm today.
Kondaya was released yesterday on the order of Minuwangoda Magistrate as his DNA samples did not match with that of Seya’s. However his brother Saman Jayalath was remanded till November 2.
