His life was an inspiration to others


	

Mahinda Bandusena, a senior and very distinguished public servant passed away recently after a fairly prolonged period of ill-health. What is note-worthy about the formative period of his career covering school and university, is the total reliance on the free education system and the enabling environment that it ushered. 


A quintessentially village lad, with practically no social props he availed himself with a vengeance of the opportunities the free education system offered. He applied himself with extra-ordinary determination, short circuiting the school calendar through double promotions and commenced his university career at Peradeniya at a very young age. It is a tribute alike to his determination and innate abilities that he secured a place, through a highly competitive examination in the coveted Administrative Service. 

 


he slowly but steadily advanced towards the summit of the service, serving as an Additional Secretary Defence, Secretary Industries and Secretary Public Adminstration. 


 


Thereafter he slowly but steadily advanced towards the summit of the service, serving as an Additional Secretary Defence, Secretary Industries and Secretary Public Adminstration. He performed with such acceptance in this position that his minister, Mr. Rathnasiri Wickremanayake, on becoming prime minister sought his services as secretary to the Prime Minister. His career in the public service was crowned with the position of Ambassador to Israel. In every one of these positions he gave of his best. The somewhat conducive political and administrative atmosphere that prevailed during this time enabled him to do what is expected of an administrator keeping political and other vultures at bay. 

 
Although so thoroughly immersed in the public service at such heights, he remained essentially a family man, ensuring that his two daughters and son ended up as medical and engineering professionals. He was singularly fortunate in the two sons-in-law and the daughter-in-law that joined his family.    His wife Lalitha, the three children and grand children sustained him especially during his unfortunate illness. The loving care with which his wife nursed him, administering myriad medications meticulously, at frequent intervals will stand out as a shining example of wifely devotion and love.    It is to be hoped that his life as an administrator and family man will be an inspiration to others. May he attain the supreme Bliss of Nirvana.   
H.P.W.
