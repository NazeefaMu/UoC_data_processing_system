Ravi responds to Chinese envoy


	

Responding to Chinese Ambassador Yi Xianliang, Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake yesterday said he had every right to talk on behalf of Sri Lanka as a sovereign country.

Likewise, he said the Ambassador also had the same right to talk on behalf of his country. The Ambassador, at a recent media conference, said he asked Mr. Karunanayake as to why another loan was sought if the Chinese loans were expensive.

The Minister said if the rate was only two per cent as the Ambassador said, he was prepared to show how it had been higher than that.(Kelum Bandara)
