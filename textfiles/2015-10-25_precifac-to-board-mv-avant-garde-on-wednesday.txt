A Police team attached of the PRECIFAC would board MV Avant Garde vessel at the Galle Port for investigations on Wednesday, October 28, PRECIFAC Secretary said.
The team would be sent to verify whether there were a connection with MV Avant Garde and the Rakna Arakshana Lanka Ltd. (RALL), Secretary to the Presidential Commission of Inquiry appointed to Investigate Serious Acts of Fraud, Corruption and Abuse of Power, State resources, and Privileges Lacille De Silva said.
“We will be sending our team to the Avant Garde vessel in connection with the investigations pertaining to the RALL. We suspect that the RALL had given the weapons and ammunitions to the MV Avant Garde,” he said.
Mr. De Silva said they had informed the IGP N.K. Illangakoon in this regard and the Police team would count all the weapons and ammunitions on board the vessel.
The Sri Lanka Navy found 810 weapons on board MV Avant Garde at the time of its detection at sea some 12 nautical miles off Galle on October 6.
It is reported that the ship crew had also claimed the weapons belonged to RALL.
The CID who was investigating into the vessel sealed off four containers of the vessel with a large stock of firearms and ammunition on October 18.
