Corruption: The main enemy of the nation


	

Corruption is rampant all over like the air we breathe. The development and reputation of the country depend on the impact of the corrupt regime which has a direct impact of law and order and rule of law.  


There is no room for law and order with corrupt rulers, corruption and nepotism. 


Sri Lanka was ranked 4th in the globe in law and order. Sri Lanka was also ranked very much below, also ranked as a hub for drug peddling with daylight robberies and crimes increasing by the day.   
President Sirisena has launched his war against corruption by appointing three Ministers headed by the Health Minister who is also questioned over accusations of misuse of public funds in rent, shipping scams and other shady transactions (Which are in the public domain.)   


Incidentally the Prime Minister-who is alleged to be also involved in the CBSL Bond Scam by inviting and defending Arjuna Mahendran- too have launched a vigorous campaign against bribery and corruption in the recent past by appointing a committee to carry out the programme under his personal supervision. This is despite other programmes.

It is an open secret that politicians are directly or indirectly  involved in corrupt activities and carrying on the criminal acts against the State without being investigated.   


Only a few members of the Government are inquired into and these too are over petty incidents, when accusations amounting to millions and trillions on the Ministers are shelved.   


Accusations against former President Mahinda Rajapaksa of siphoning USD 18 billion and banking them in Dubai-as alleged by Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne- are also shelved with no inquiry or further proceedings.   


Against a  President  in office, allegations can emerge only after he/she relinquished the post as a President is protected by Immunity under the Constitution.   


Bribery Commission should take notice of complaints via media and take immediate steps or exonerate the accused person to be fair by him.  


Bribery is an offence against the State punishable jointly under the Bribery Act and the Penal Code with a special procedure by a Commission appointed by the Constitutional Council and headed by a Director General. A reputed and experienced lawyer is also appointed by the President.   With the limited staff and the resources it is not possible to net the countrywide bribe takers unless other methods such as education, name-and-shame methods with the help of the media, recognizing and rewarding the complainants and the informants, appointment of dedicated officers in the public sector, are used.  But using traditional investigation methods it is hard to find millions of indirect/direct bribing in business transactions and Government dealings.

a hot Topic 
Because it is currently a hot topic two seminars were organized at the Organization of Professionals Associations (OPA) on February 15 and 16 by ‘Sri Lanka 2050.’


The seminars were organized and moderated by the former Ambassador Sarath Wijesinghe. Speakers were D. E. W. Gunasekera- former Minister, Rusiripala Tennekoon, former BOC Chairman, Nanagananda Kodituwakku, activist lawyer. Sham Nuwan Ganawatte, journalist the author of Kawada Hora (Who is the Thief ) in the Bond Scam. 


The second day was jointly organized by the BASL and OPA on Bribery and Good Governance addressed by Sarath Jayamanne, Director General Bribery Commission, S. C. Mayadunne, former Auditor General, and Yasantha Kodagoda Additional Solicitor General and President’s Counsel.   
The first day was lively while the second seminar was somewhat academic.  


The seminars indicated the interest and activism in the field of bribery and corruption and deliberations were extremely useful on planning war on bribery and corruption and planning out short and long term strategies for eradication of the menace.   


We do not find fault with the Director General and the Commission as it is not our culture as in USA where the sitting President was rigorously interrogated by the special prosecutor, when in Sri Lanka the Prime Minister who invited Mahendran to Sri Lanka and defended him in the Parliament was soft peddled by giving few questions in advance, contrary to the professional way the other witness were interrogated.   


In India and many countries, Members of Parliament had been found guilty on charges of bribery and corruption, but in Sri Lanka despite the public knowledge and information corruption is rampant from the top downwards.   

 

eradication impossible 
Eradication of bribery and corruption is impossible. The attempts should be to minimize and to introduce a bribery/corruption free culture in the society.   


Is it possible in the current political and economic climate of poverty struggle corruption, with easy black money and disappearance of social values?


Director General of BC Sarath Jayamanna compared the situation in the West as culturally anti-bribe. He appears to be working hard within his mandate which is an impossible task to achieve alone, unless legal structure is strengthened and new strategies adopted with honest, dedicated and committed leadership. Dilrukshi de Silva started the job as DG of BC with enthusiasm and funfair. However  she was compelled to leave and services of Lacille Silva was abruptly discontinued by a powerful, invisible hand.  


The rule of law and equality before law should be rigorously implemented to clamp down on bribery and corruption
