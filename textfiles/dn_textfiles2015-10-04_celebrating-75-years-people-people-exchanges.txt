Celebrating 75 years of people-to-people exchanges

Marking 75 years of U.S. government-sponsored international exchange programs, U.S. Ambassador to Sri Lanka and Maldives Atul Keshap hosted a reception for Sri Lankan alumni at the Jefferson House on September 28. Since 1952, the United States has sponsored over 2500 visitors from Sri Lanka, participating in exchanges such as the International Visitor Leadership Program, Fulbright, Hubert Humphrey, and Eisenhower, as well as Professional and Legislative programs.
