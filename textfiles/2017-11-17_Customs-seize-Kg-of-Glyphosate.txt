A stock of the banned chemical Glyphosate worth Rs.3.3 million, was seized at the Rank Container Terminal (RCT) in Orugodawatta today, Customs Superintendent Ranjith Kumarasinghe said.

He said during the investigations, Customs officers found 656 kilograms of Glyphosate powder packed in 14 boxes.

“Each box contained 20 packets of Glyphosate weighing 100 grams each and 10 packets of one kilogram each packed in 14 separate boxes,” Mr. Kumarasinghe said and added that the 20-foot container had arrived at the Colombo Port from Tuticorin in Tamil Nadu on Wednesday.

He said the container was loaded with sacks of potato and green chillies and the consignment declared as potatoes.

“When examining the Customs declaration papers, the officers found a scanned copy of the invoice attached to the declaration papers. The Customs Officers who felt suspicious of the documents, had started investigations,” Mr. Mr. Kumarasinghe said.

“The officers had noticed the boxes of Glyphosate after the potatoes were unloaded. They were under sacks of green chillie,” Mr.Kumarasinghe said.

The importer was identified as a businessman from the Ja-ela who was also a resident of Saindamadu in Kalmunai.

“Some 12,710 kilograms of potatoes worth Rs.800,000 and 1,806 kilograms of green chillies worth Rs.1.8 million were among the goods unloaded from the container. It is illegal to import green chillies to Sri Lanka. The stock of potatoes and green chillie could have been contaminated with Glyphosate. The customs will release the stock of potatoes after an inspection by food inspectors," Mr. Kumarasinghe said.

The raid was carried out on the instructions of Customs Director H.M.S. Premarathne under the supervision of Deputy Director G.G Premasiri. Investigations were carried out by Customs Deputy Directors Ranjith Kumarasinghe, Chandana Dharmapriya, R.M.C.U. Ratnayaka, Customs Appraisers Ms. Chandani Senavirathne, Chandana Gamage Nalin Perera, Keerthi Herath, G.K. Ravihansa and Assistant Superintendent L. Tennakoon.
