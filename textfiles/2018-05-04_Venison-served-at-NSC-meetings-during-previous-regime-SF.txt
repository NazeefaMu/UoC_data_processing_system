Speaking to the journalists after assuming duties on Wednesday (2) he said a variety of venison including deer, sambhur, wild boar and quail meat were usually on the lunch menu during these meetings. "I will deliver justice to wild animals,” he said.

He pointed out that National Freedom Front (NFF) Leader MP Wimal Weerawansa should have been offered a ‘dog ministry’ during the previous regime as he showed their genetics now.
