AIA’s ‘Healthiest Workplace Survey’, in Sri Lanka for the very first time!


	



AIA Insurance announced the launch of Sri Lanka’s Healthiest Workplace Survey (HWS) at the Great Place to Work conference yesterday. The Healthiest Workplace Survey is a comprehensive survey of the health and wellbeing of employees around Asia-Pacific. Having surveyed thousands of employees across multiple industries since its inception in 2017, this survey is being conducted by RAND Europe, a leading researcher in the field of health and wellness. 

Companies that participate can get a clear understanding of the health and wellbeing profiles of employees in terms of lifestyle, clinical indicators, mental health, stress, and other areas of concern. Companies can further gauge how well their wellness and health programmes are being utilised and how effective they are in improving employees’ health. 

Companies can then use the results of the survey to identify effective interventions so that they can improve or initiate health promotion strategies to create a healthier work environment for their people. Over time these interventions will help boost the organisation's business performance by increasing productivity and reducing absenteeism. Taking part in the survey is free. 

Research and analysis for HWS is conducted by RAND Europe with support from local academic partners, which provide academic advisory services and validate the survey questionnaire and findings. Research will focus on understanding productivity loss and how workplace wellness strategies can be applied to reduce this loss.

AIA Chief Marketing Office Nikhil Advani noted, “Given that so much of our time is spent at work, it’s important that we understand, measure and ultimately, improve wellbeing in the workplace. This survey gives employers an understanding of employees’ health and wellbeing, giving them useful strategies to support them in their healthy living goals and improving company-wide productivity. If you calculate the productivity per employer that is lost to absenteeism and presenteeism every year in Asia, there is a clear message that identifying and addressing risks to employee health is critical to business performance. We aim to equip companies in Sri Lanka with the best insights and strategies to help improve business productivity while also improving wellbeing in the workplace.”

Sri Lankan companies with over 50 employees can participate, for free, in the programme, to be recognized under 3 key categories; Healthiest Workplace, Healthiest Employer and Healthiest Employee. You can register your company on the AIA website < www.aialife.com> under the ‘AIA Vitality’ tab, on or before the 20th July.
