The Financial Crime Investigation Division (FCID) should not be dissolved as the UPFA too had complaints to lodge against officials of the current Government, UPFA MP Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena said.

Addressing a news conference held at former president Mahinda Rajapaksa’s Public Relations Office, he said they would lodge complains to the FCID against Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran, as well as the Secretaries of the Finance and Defence Ministries under a UPFA government.

"We too can benefit from the FCID, therefore we don't think it should be dissolved. The FCID today summons and questions MPs with the intention of avenging. People are summoned based on bogus allegations. We do not approve this. But, if the charges are proven, action should be taken against them," he said.

Commenting on the appointment of the Central Bank Governor, he said Mr. Mahendran should not be appointed for another term and that an honest, impartial official with integrity should be appointed to the position. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
