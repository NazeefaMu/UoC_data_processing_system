They are set to ride elephant-back


	

Two Betel leaf politicos involved in court cases posing a threat to their political future are now set to ride elephant-back, they say.



Political allegiance of these two politicos following a downturn of their fortunes has been see-sawing between the former strongman and the Compassionate One and the duo have now made up their mind on the course of their political journey, they say.  


One of them is said to be a character from Sabaragamuwa who had to mark time in a state lodge for several months. The other Betel leaf politico poised to do the pole-vault is a business tycoon from Rajarata. Political heavyweights hailing from the district this politico represents have already got the wind of his intentions.


However, the Rajarata politico is facing strong opposition to his intended move from his home-front itself, 
they say.
