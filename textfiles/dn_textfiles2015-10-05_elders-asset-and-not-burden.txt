Elders, an asset and not a burden

In Sri Lanka persons aged 60 years of age and above are called elderly.
Increasing elderly population has become a global trend including Sri Lanka.
In 1971 Sri Lankan elderly population was 6.3% of the total population and in 1981 it was increased up to 6.6%. Today it has become more than 12% and it is expected to be 20.7% by the year 2031.
When considering the population structure those who are completing 75 years of age and more are called old-old category. In our set up old –old category of elderly persons are increasing with the time. According to the country statistics in 1971 old old category represented 19.5%, in 2012 it was 24.2% and it is expected to be 29.9% by the year 2031. This gives an alarming sign for the policy makers and programme planners to focus more when developing programmes for the elderly.
Though increasing elderly population presents challenges in many forms, it has to be taken as an assert and not as a burden. Of the challenges health, social and economical challenges have become more prominent.
Non communicable diseases are more prevalent among elderly in the society. In the current society every one is engaging in busy schedules. Unhealthy life styles including poor dietary habits, lack of exercise and mental stresses and malpractices like smoking commonly lead towards ill health. Same as other aged groups many of the health problems among elderly are the results of those risk factors which originate either during pregnancy, childhood, youth or adulthood. Implementation of active healthy concept is initiated to overcome such situations during old age.
Promotion of active healthy ageing starts before birth. It is a life course approach and progress from womb to tomb. Longer the elderly person live actively and healthy they enjoy their life with independence and giving more contribution and participation towards society. Active healthy ageing needs prior planning without waiting someone to be 60 years of age. It does not concern only on health but focuses overall quality of life of the elderly. That explains the necessity of strengthening muti-sectoral collaboration with a special attention towards social services and education sectors.
Disabilities restrict activities
Disabilities are more common among elders. Vision problems, hearing problems and mobility problems are common among them. These disabilities restrict activities of daily living of elders and their independence. Many disabilities need rehabilitation. Most of the disabilities are preventable with early identification and early interventions. Some disabilities take place as a complication of non-communicable diseases like diabetes mellitus. Community need proper awareness on preventive factors as well as facilities and service availability for prevention of disabilities and rehabilitation.
Many elders live alone. Loneliness and isolation has become a major issue among them. Illnesses like dementia are common among elders. Active healthy ageing addresses promotion of mental well-being of elders. There are many simple identified activities to be done to maintain mental well being. The problem among us is we are not focusing them as they seems to be simple and less costly. How many of us are having hobbies or how many of us are engage in recreational activities? Common answer would be negative. Though promotion of active healthy ageing starts from early life if someone is already in the elderly group is also not late to start active healthy ageing life. For many persons life starts from age of 60 years. You may have many hidden capabilities which are good for the society and hobbies within you which you may not know. During your old age it is the golden time to take them out and practice in a productive manner and positive manner. Through these activities you are promoting your mental well-being even without much of an effort.
Engage more towards e-world only
Elders are a resource to the society. Their knowledge, skills and life experiences are vast. But unfortunately shifting of such capabilities to the younger generation is limited. Younger persons are over burden with academic stress or engage more towards e-world only. They may not in a capacity to appreciate the values of our elders. Most of the time there is a generational gap which makes elders and younger apart. Shifting of extended family system to the nuclear family system has become another contributory factor for this situation. Strategies should be drawn according to needs of the family or culture to narrow this gap. By doing it elders get better mental well being and younger get more productivity and better attitudes.
Community needs to be aware for the activities identified to promote active healthy ageing among elders. Such information can be obtained through various services available in the health institutions both in the curative and preventive sector.
Every year 01st of October is declared as the International Day of Older Persons. Sustainability and age inclusiveness in the urban development is the theme for this year. Creating an age friendly environment for elders has become a timely need in the society. To become such environment friendly it has to be more accessible and safe for the elders. Focusing more towards accident free and availability of disability accessibility for elders would be more productive. When it comes to availability of disabled accessibility facilities authorities need to concentrate more towards providing them according to the standards and guidelines instead of building them in a hazardous manner. Age friendly city concept is already implemented in our country and it is progressing successfully at Wallawaya, Monaragala district.
Ensuring enabling supportive environment for elders will enhance their participation, dignity, independence and self-fulfilment. All these are contributory factors for the promotion of active healthy ageing.
