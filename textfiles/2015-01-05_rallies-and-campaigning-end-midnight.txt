Additional Elections Commissioner U.

Meanwhile, PAFFREL Executive Director Rohana Hettiatachci said one of the significant factors of this election was the increased incidences of election violence in comparison to 2010 Presidential Poll.
He said by yesterday, there were 740 incidents of election related violence recorded by PAFFREL. “173 of them were of serious nature and 62 victims of violence had been hospitalised,” he said.
Incidentally, this Presidential Election campaign was the shortest in election history as it ran only for 29 days. (Sandun A. Jayasekera)
