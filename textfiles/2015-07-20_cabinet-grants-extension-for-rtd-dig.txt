The Cabinet has granted the approval for the extension of former DIG Indu Karunaratne five months after he retired from service, Public Order and Christian Religious Affairs Minister John Amaratunga said today.
“The former DIG had made a request for his extension on time but somehow it had been taken up for consideration late by the relevant authorities,” the Minister said.
Former DIG Karunaratne had retired in mid February this year.
Meanwhile, Police spokesman Ruwan Gunasekera said he could not confirm the re-appointment of retired DIG Indu Karunaratne.
“He has not reported to work yet”, the Spokesman said.
