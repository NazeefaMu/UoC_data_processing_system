Private sector holidays not in gazette notifications: Vajira


	

The fact that no indication has been given about the public and bank holiday for the private sector on May 7 in lieu of May 1 (May Day) was not a discrepancy but a result of the government’s method of issuing gazette notifications, Home Affair Minister Vajira Abeywardena said.

The government officially announced about nullifying the Public and Bank Holiday on May 1, while May 7 has been declared a Public and Bank holiday instead. The change was made following the government’s decision to shift the May Day holiday to May 7, he explained.

The Minister further said that only public and bank holidays are issued via government gazette notifications and private sector holidays are not included.

In terms of the powers vested in the Minister of Home Affairs under the Holiday Act No. 29 of 1971, all holidays pertaining to the year 2018 have been published by Gazette Notification No. 2024/55 on Saturday June 24, 2017 which relates only to the government sector and excludes the private sector.

Minister Abeywardana said that a private circular relating to holidays would be issued by the Labour Ministry. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)
