A white collar high-up of a certain Ministry who called at an automobile repair and service centre to get a minor repair to his vehicle done was intrigued to find a counterpart of his in another Ministry seated inside the office with his back to him. However, he immediately recognized 
the man.  

 


His curiosity gave way to suspicion when the repair shop owner appeared keen to be rid of his presence from the place. “Sir, why do you waste your time here. You may hop into a tuck-tuck and get back to your office. I’ll phone you up the moment the job is finished!”.


The white collar high-up said while having his eye on the counterpart seated inside the office: “Don’t worry. I’ll wait…”  


The garage owner approached him again several minutes later. 


“Sir, I’ll tell you the truth. This is in strict confidence. I know that you saw the other Mahattaya from … Ministry. We are servicing the vehicles of that Ministry on a regular basis. So we are paying a small ‘commission’ to that Mahattaya once a month. He has come to collect the commission. He is waiting there afraid to come out, because you are here…!” He added humbly: “After all, Sir, we are doing a business here. No?”


“Okay, I am leaving if that is the case,” saying thus the white collar one left the place.
