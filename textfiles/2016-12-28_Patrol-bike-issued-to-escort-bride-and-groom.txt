Heads of the Police Traffic Headquarters are baffled by the act of a junior officer who had permitted a powerful highway patrol motorcycle (worth Rs.3.5 million) to be used to escort a wedding car in Modera last week.

The Chief Inspector at the Traffic Police Headquarters had given permission to send a 600 cc Yamaha motorcycle -- which according to an order given by IGP Pujith Jayasundara should be solely used for highway and express way patrolling, .

Daily Mirror learns that motorcycle No. BAS 6534 had been sent to escort a car carrying the newly weds from Kotahena to Modera last Thursday (22) evening.

The motorcycle had escorted the car to the couple's wedding reception at the ‘Jesu Jeewamanai’ Church in Aluthmawatha Road, Modera, where President Maithripala Sirisena had been a special dignitary.

A request by one of the wedding organisers on the previous day to the Superintendent of Traffic Headquarters to issue a powerful motorcycle to escort the wedding car had been refused as it was strictly against orders.

A recent circular by the IGP had stated that such bikes should only be used for highway patrolling, and special permission should be sought from the Senior DIG if it was to be used for any other purpose, such as escorting a foreign dignitary or a religious leader.

The said CI had issued the motorcycle without such permission and caused a stir among the police top brass for defying orders.

The same officer had had to face an inquiry earlier for issuing a Police radio patrol car for a non-official purpose on his own initiative.(Kurulu Koojana Kariyakarawana)
