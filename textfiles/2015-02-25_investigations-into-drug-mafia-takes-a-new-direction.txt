	Ongoing investigations into the drug mafia have taken a new twist, they say.

There is widespread public discontent and disappointment that grilling of Dumi by the sleuths for hours on end appears to have produced no tangible result. What has really happened is that the evidence that sleuths have unearthed have taken them in another direction.
The drug ring Dumi figures in, has helped certain bigwigs of the former regime to launder their filthy lucre!
Police have thrown the dragnet to catch the big fish involved in money laundering and their being hauled before Courts is just a matter of course, they say.  Investigations are to continue until the Police are able to come out with iron-clad proof against the bigwigs involved.
