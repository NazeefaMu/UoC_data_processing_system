Anti-SAITM protest teargassed


	

Police fired teargas and used water cannons to disperse the anti-SAITM protesters who were protesting at the Kollupitiya Junction a short while ago.

A court order was earlier issued by the Colombo Fort Magistrate against the protest march by the anti-SAITM groups, including the Inter University Students' Federation (IUSF).

The Court ordered the protesters to conduct the protest in a decent and polite manner without disrupting the general public and vandalizing public property.

It also ordered them not to enter the Presidential Secretariat Office by any means.

Meanwhile, at least 14 individuals who were injured in the incident have been admitted to the National Hospital, Colombo.

Hospital sources said two student monks, a journalist and a woman were among those hospitalised. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
