Union Bank of Colombo PLC (UBC) recently introduced a redefined banking experience with a new outlook and ambience to its head office and new branches. 
Cascading this initiative to its existing branches, the new outlook was unveiled at the bank’s Nawala branch located at 232, Nawala Road, Nawala, offering even greater convenience in banking.  
“The new layout portrays UBC’s vibrant personality as a rapidly progressive bank offering greater customer value,” said Union Bank Director/Chief Executive Officer Indrajit Wickramasinghe.
He further stated that this change is pivotal and timely for the bank and is aligned with Union Bank’s new aspirations of being a key player in the industry with a wider focus on retail, corporate and small and medium enterprise (SME) segments.
Upgrades to the outlook of branches have been introduced as a result of the recent investment by TPG, a leading global investment firm in UBC. As such, the refurbishment is part of UBC’s on-going expansion and development plans to provide an enhanced customer experience.  
The bank’s product and service portfolio provides end-to-end financial solutions to support personal and business needs that range from current and savings accounts, personal loans and leasing facilities supported by an unparalleled service. 
A new suite of products will also be introduced shortly to further enhance the bank’s existing product portfolio. Customers have easy access to their account through 62 branches islandwide and over 1500 other bank ATMs connected to the LankaPay Common ATM Switch.
