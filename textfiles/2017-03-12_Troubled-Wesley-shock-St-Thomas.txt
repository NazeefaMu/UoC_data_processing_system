A troubled Wesley side who came into the field sans a few of their top players pulled off the first upset in the ongoing Under 20 inter-school rugby tournament when they defeated the fancied and high riding S. Thomas' side by 23 points to 19 in the match played at Longdon Place. Pics by Nisal Baduge
