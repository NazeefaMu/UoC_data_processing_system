Matugama Chief Magistrate Wasantha Kosala Senadira, yesterday, warned United National Party (UNP) MP Palitha Thewarapperua over his non appearance in court.

The magistrate said parliament was the law making arm and the MPs were the law makers. He told Mr. Thewarapperuma that the law makers should be law abiding.

A warrant had been issued for the arrest of the MP due to his not appearing in court for cases involving him and not reporting to the police. However, he had later surrendered to court accompanied by his lawyers.

His lawyers had informed Court that he had been unable to appear in court as he was suffering from a heart ailment. The magistrate then ordered him to report to the court registrar during second and third week of every month. He was then enlarged on bail at the request of his lawyers.(Sunil S.Thantriarachchi)
