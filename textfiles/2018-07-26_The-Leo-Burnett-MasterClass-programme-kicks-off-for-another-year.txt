Leo Burnett is proud to announce the commencement of its MasterClass programme from 18th July 2018 at its office in Colombo. Launched in 2013, this multi-disciplinary 5-week internship programme is designed for youth interested in joining the advertising and related industries. This initiative was conceptualized by Leo Burnett as a means to nurture new talent in the industry. The primary purpose of this internship is to provide hands-on experience to young Sri Lankan undergraduates who are keen to pursue a career in the industry.

The number of applications for the programme has seen a steady growth over the years. This year too, 10 high potential candidates were selected from a large pool of applicants to participate in the MasterClass. The candidates were selected after an interview with a panel of mentors from the Leo Burnett team. The programme covers all advertising industry functions as well as other areas of marketing communications such as media, publishing, broadcast production, market research, event management and marketing. Interns have the opportunity to pursue their interests in the industry not just within the various departments within the agency itself but also within the industry at large which includes the marketing teams of client organizations, research agencies, TV production houses, stations, newspaper houses, digital production agencies and recording studios.


 
Buoyed by the tremendous success of the past programmes, Leo Burnett is holding the Leo Burnett MasterClass this year for the 6th consecutive year. The programme commenced with an induction at the Leo Burnett office on 9th July and will conclude on 17th August 2018 with the awarding of certificates to those who have successfully completed the full programme at the graduation ceremony.

As Leo Burnett celebrates its 19th year of operations in Sri Lanka and looks ahead to the future, the agency continues to focus on its HumanKind approach to help build meaningful partnerships to garner peer recognition in the industry.
