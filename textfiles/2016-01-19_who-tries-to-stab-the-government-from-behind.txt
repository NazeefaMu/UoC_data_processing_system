The purohita dealing with matters foreign tossed a bombshell at the government group meeting the other day. 
Some people who didn’t extend one cent worth of support either to the Compassionate One or the Green leader to bring yahapalanaya into power, try to stab the government from behind, he warned.  Initially none could figure out as to whom the Matara man was driving at.
Some of them first thought that he had targeted a senior Betel leaf politico who had his dream of attaining prime purohita status shattered. 
Finally it was established that he aimed his barb at a Senior Banda from the hills who lost his seat at the polls, but managed to make his way to Diyawanna through the wish-fulfilling list.
