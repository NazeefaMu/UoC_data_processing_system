President Maithripala Sirisena and Former President Chandrika Kumaratunga are slated to grace the United National Party’s (UNP) 70th anniversary celebrations from September 4 to 10, a UNP MP said yesterday.

UNP Gampaha District MP Edward Gunasekera told a news conference that the main event to mark the 70th Anniversary would be the party's annual convention on September 10 in Colombo.

President Sirisena will attend the Convention of the UNP as he did last time.

He said former President Ms. Chandrika Kumaratunga might participate in a get together of the party seniors on September 9.

“Ms. Kumaratunga’s participation is not confirmed yet but we expect that she will come for the get-together,” he said.

Some foreign dignitaries have also been invited to this fellowship according to the MP.

The MP said the anniversary celebrations would be kicked off with a fellowship of close associates of the party, while there would be another fellowship for party seniors and foreign associations on September 9.

A Pirith chanting ceremony has also been organised at party head quarters, Sirikotha, following a Sangika Dhamma for 70 Buddhist monks on September 5.

A Christian religious service will be held in Wattala on September 8, 2016 organised by Minister John Amaratunga and a Islamic religious programme at Maligawatte Jumma Mosque on September 7.

This will be organised by MP Mujubur Rahaman.

Responding to a question raised by the journalists as to whether there would be any reshuffle of party positions, the MP said this would be decided by the working committee of the UNP, which would meet on September 6. (Yohan Perera)
