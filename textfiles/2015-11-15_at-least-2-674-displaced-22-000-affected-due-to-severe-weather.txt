Rain which had splashed in torrents over the weekend had created havoc in many parts of the country with the Chilaw hospital and a hotel in Dambulla going under water and making many roads impassable especially in the Puttalam District, the DMC said today.
Sluice gates of several reservoirs including the Iranamadu tank in the North, Nachchiduwa, Kalawewa, Nuwara Weva, Ampara Wewa were opened as the water levels increased. Water levels of Senanayake Samudra were said to be rising with the continuous rain.
The DMC said close to 2,674 individuals had been displaced and 22,000 affected by the floods in Kilinochchi, Jaffna, Mullaithivu, Puttalam and Gampaha.
Those displaced in Mullaithivu, Puttalam and Kilinochchi had been re-located and had been provided with adequate food, clean water, medicine and sanitary facilities, DMC Spokesman Pradeep Kodippili said.
One person has also been killed so far due to the floods in Iranaimadhu, Kilinochchi area while a 38-year-old father of two had been reported missing since yesterday in Asgiriya, Gampaha after he fell in to the Aththanagalu Oya.

A disturbance in the Bay of Bengal, which intensified into a low pressure area Southeast of Sri Lanka is the cause of the rainy weather, the Meteorology Department said. (Piyumi Fonseka and Yohan Perera)WATCH
