UNP politburo meeting today


	

The UNP politburo will meet today at Temple Trees to discuss the methodology to be followed when electing the main officer bearers and the names of those to be selected to these posts, a politburo member told Daily Mirror.

It was reported that there was a suggestion during the previous meeting that the three key posts General Secretary, National Organizer and the Chairman should be decided through a ballot. However other sources said there was another proposal that the general secretary and other posts should be appointed in the usual way and the party leader should also have a say in it.

The working committee and the politburo will meet on Thursday to take the final decisions on re-organising the party. (Yohan Perera)
