Allocate ministry subjects effectively and scientifically: Champika


	

Minister of Megapolis Patali Champika Ranawaka today urged Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to allocate Ministry subjects scientifically when restructuring the Cabinet so that development could be carried out efficiently and effectively.

Minister Ranawaka said this at the inauguration of Lakeview middle-income housing project in Thalawathugoda last morning.

“Our Ministry will have to work with over 123 institutions including the Department of lands. This is a time consuming one. We had to wait for a long period to rectify a certain issue pertaining to a land and if the subjects are allocated for Ministries effectively and scientifically we would be able to minimise the problems.

“I hope the President and Prime Minister take this into an issue when allocating ministry subjects in the coming cabinet restructure,” the Minister said.

“Making the State institutions and the judiciary independent alone is not enough as efficiency should be brought into these,” he added.

The Minister said it took 17 years for him to settle a certain court case.

Also, Minister Ranawaka said areas coming under local bodies should also be changed. He said some parts of Kotte and Battaramulla came under Kaduwela Pradeshiya Sabha but other areas come under Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte.

This he said also created problems when carrying out development work.

Therefore the Minister suggested that all these areas should come under one local body so that development could move speedily.

He said the Government would go ahead with Sethsiripaya Phase 4 and 5 soon.

He said lands have been already allocated to set up official residence for the Prime Minister and President. “Sri Jayewardenepura Kotte will soon become an administrative area,” he said. (Yohan Perera)
