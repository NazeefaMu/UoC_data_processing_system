More than 2,500 people have been killed in 2,360 road accidents during the first 11 months of this year, according to the National Council for Road Safety (NCRS).
NCRS Chairman Dr. Sisira Kodagoda said of the 2,538 deaths due to road accidents during the period, 760 had been killed in accidents involving motorbikes while 726 had been pedestrians.
He said vehicular traffic had to be streamlined in all roads in the country since the number of accidents and fatalities were rising every year.
Pointing out that the highest number of accidents had taken place on the 3.4 kilometre stretch between Maliban Junction in Ratmalana and Kawdana junction in Dehiwala, Dr. Kodagoda said a special programme to increase awareness of motorists on accident prone areas would be implemented soon.
