A birthday party that went sour


	



 

It was the birthday of a provincial bigwig and his staff chief organized a surprise reception to the boss to mark the event. 

 


He got the big man’s office decorated with balloons and streamers, had the special birthday cake delivered on time and made sure that everything was in perfect order. And they were all eagerly awaiting the arrival of the boss. 


The bigwig arrived and walked into his office without the slightest hint of what was to be expect inside. The staff chief and a few other white-collar high-ups followed him. 


The reaction of the bigwig was something they never expected. Looking around with visible annoyance, he angrily barked at his staff chief. “I say, what is this nonsense? I am not a small child to play with balloons. Tear off all these decorations immediately!”


A few loyal subordinates later gathered around the highly dejected staff chief to commiserate with him. 


“See men, what I got in return for a good thing I had done!” he told his sympathizers. 


“Well, Sir, you asked for it and got it bellyful!” one of them quipped.
