There were conspiracies to kill us: Gotabaya


	

There had always been conspiracies to kill us. There were death threats even when Prabhakaran was alive. But we endured all these threats due to virtues we posses, former Secretary of Defence Gotabaya Rajapaksa said.

Speaking as the chief guest at the religious ceremony on an invitation of the Chief Incumbent of Embulgama Rajamaha Viharaya-Ven Dankande Bodhiwansa Thera, held in connection with the unveiling of the Samadhi Buddha Statue and the inauguration of Sathara Maha Devalaya at the temple premises he said that one cannot afford to live in fear of death.

"We must do something for the country where we are born. I never asked to strengthen my security - people are there for my protection,” he said.

In response to the questions by the media personnel about Minister Sarath Fonseka’s remarks about his non-eligibility for security, Gotabaya Rajapaksa said leaders of the country would decide about providing security for him or otherwise. Anyone can express his opinion. I am also aware of a young UNP parliamentarian saying that I deserve protection as well as the president as I have served the country as defence secretary.

When asked whether he was satisfied with investigation on the incident, he said he only knows that investigation has been assigned to CID and believed they would do the duties well as they had done during his period.

Replying to the questions about IGP he said we have to be concerned about one’s post and not personally. We have had good IGPs in the past. When forces were engaged in war in the East and the North, police assured the security in other parts of the country. He also reminded about the then IGP who was ready to resign on an incident which happened in Katunayaka.

Various people have various skills-in singing, dancing but we expect nothing of these from an IGP, he said. (K. Budhika Kumarasiri)
