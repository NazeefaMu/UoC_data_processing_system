Ambassador for Sri Lanka to United States Prasad Kariyawasam said the Government was working with all stakeholders in the country and the international community to establish mechanisms for truth-seeking, justice, and reparations to give solace to all those who suffered during the armed conflict.


 Mr. Kariyawasam addressing a gathering at the East-West Center in Hawaii said the new unity Government comprising of the two main political parties in the country, led by President Sirisena and Prime Minister Wickremesinghe was promoting rehabilitation and reconstruction in areas affected by the recent conflict.


“Sri Lanka has bolstered its age-old democracy by firmly re-establishing the independence of the judiciary, combating corruption, and allowing a free and vibrant media to flourish,” he said.


The Ambassador Kariyawasam said the government would soon embark on drafting a new constitution which would address the requirements of a modern, progressive nation with provisions aimed at addressing the grievances of all communities living in the Island and promote social justice.


He said these initiatives had progressed remarkably well and in fact, after 43 years, a US State Secretary visited Sri Lanka last May.
