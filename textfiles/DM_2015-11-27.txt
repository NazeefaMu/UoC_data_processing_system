Elections Commission hits legal obstacles
	
The newly constituted Elections Commission has been hit a legal lacuna, with it being unable to determine its functions and roles, it is learnt.
The Constitutional Council, reintroduced under the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, nominated three members to the Elections Commission establishing it for the first time in the country. Yet, the absence of legal provisions has become a problem in deciding on its roles and responsibilities.
However, it is learnt that the authorities of the Elections Commission are making arrangements in this respect. The Commission comprises three members.
Asked for a comment in this regard, Peoples Action for Free and Fair Elections (PAFFREL) said legal provisions should be made available spelling out the scope of commissions established for the first time in the country.
Its Executive Director Rohana Hettiarachchi said it was particularly relevant to the Election Commission. He said the Elections Department discharged election related duties in the past, and with the setting up of this commission, a separate legislation was needed to determine its scope in the present context.
It is important to have separate legislations enacted by Parliament to govern the work of independent commissions set up for the first time, he said.(Kelum Bandara)

Important decisions on Grade-5, GCE O/L soon: Akila
	
Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said today the education ministry would soon take some important decisions on the Grade-five scholarship examination and the GCE O/L examination and that a new Education Act would be introduced in January.
He said the ministry was discussing whether to continue with the two exams on the basis that these exams had placed a heavy burden on the students and the parents.
At an awareness programme held for zonal education directors regarding the distribution and implementation of cash vouchers for students to buy school uniforms, the minister said the shortcomings in the education sector would be addressed through the new Education Act.
Several countries in the world have done away with challenging exams such as GCE O/L and Grade-five scholarship exams which impose a mental pressure on the students and parents as well. We have still not decided on anything yet, but a decision will be taken on the two exams after speaking to educationalists, the minister said.
He said cash vouchers would be distributed by the ministry to students countrywide beginning November 29 while the issuing of cash vouchers to students to buy school uniforms would take place from December 1 to December 3.
The minister said the cash vouchers between Rs.450 and Rs.1,700 would be given to all students from grade one, including student monks.
"The students stand to benefit because the value of the vouchers exceed the market price of the material. Although the vouchers carry more value than the market price, the government stands to save at least Rs.500 million, he said.
The minister said the decision to issue cash vouchers was taken by the Prime Ministers sub-committee for Economic Management because of several complaints received on the shortcomings with regard to the quality of the product and the distribution procedure.
"Now they can buy quality material from any shop in any part of the country. It will help local textile shop owners as well. We held discussions with Sathosa and Salusala. They will be selling uniform materials at a fair price. Rs.2,300 million was allocated in 2014 for school uniforms for 4.2 million students in 2015. During previous government this uniform programme was riddled with corruption. However, this government will leave no room for corruption, he said. (Piyumi Fonseka)

India buys time to respond to Sethusamudram case
	
BJP leader Subramanian Swamy on Thursday has warned the NDA government against reviving the UPA's Rs 25,000 crore Sethusamudram channel project, which was meant to make Palk Strait navigable for bigger ships to save them from circling Sri Lanka while travelling from India's one coast to the other, the Economic Times said.
A bench of Chief Justice H. L. Dattu and Justice Arun Misra adjourned hearing in the controversial case after additional solicitor general Pinky Anand said the Centre needed time to respond to the issue raised in the case over the years. Justice Misra also recused from hearing the matter.
The court by an interim order in 2007 had stayed dredging of Ram Sethu or Adam's Bridge on petitioners' plea that it had immense religious value for Hindus. Swamy told the bench that he had no objection to the Centre filing a fresh affidavit. "But the Centre cannot change its stand. It had declared on the floor of Parliament that it was going to scrap the project," Swamy said as the SC adjourned hearing in the matter.
On December 1, 2014, shipping minister Pon Radhakrishnan had told Rajya Sabha, "Centre is keen to explore the possibility of alternative route for SSCP through Pamban Pass by avoiding the Ram SethuAdam's Bridge area and RITES has been entrusted with the work of undertaking pre-feasibility study on that area. RITES has submitted the report." RITES had said, "The major constraint in the Pamban channel is the narrow and shallow channel between the two coral reef islands of Pullivasal and Krusadai."

The petitioner, C. Ramamurthy, town secretary of the DVK, submitted that he was conducting the commemorative meeting on November 27 for the past 10 years. But his application to hold the meeting this year was rejected by police.
When the petition came up for hearing before Justice M.M. Sundresh, citing Supreme Court direction on similar issues, the judge allowed the petition. He also pointed out that the petitioner is proposing to hold the meeting on a private land and not in a public place.
The judge allowed a similar petition moved by P. Bharathi of Naam Thamizhar Katchi. The permission for the meeting is sought for only one day and the authorities can very well regulate it by fixing the time and venue. It is now agreed that the meeting can be held at Palanisamy Grounds Situated in Alamoor. Therefore, the respondents can very well regulate the meeting by imposing the conditions, including the time and manner in which the meeting has to be conducted, Justice Mr. Sundresh added.

New Zealand bat in Pink-ball Test
	
	Brendon McCullum finally won his first toss of the series and New Zealand will bat first in the inaugural day-night Test against Australia at Adelaide Oval. It means that Mitchell Starc will likely enter the history books as the first man to bowl a pink ball in Test cricket, with either Tom Latham or Martin Guptill to face the first delivery.
	New Zealand made one change to their line-up with spin-bowling allrounder Mitchell Santner called in to make his Test debut at the expense of fast bowler Matt Henry. Santner is listed to bat at No.6 and gives New Zealand a second slow-bowling option, with Mark Craig having retained his place as the frontline spinner.
	Australia made two forced changes due to the retirement of Mitchell Johnson and the hamstring injury suffered by Usman Khawaja in the second Test at the WACA. Peter Siddle came in for Johnson and Khawaja's replacement, Shaun Marsh, is listed at No.4. Josh Hazlewood was retained despite some queries over his workload, with James Pattinson released to play in the Sheffield Shield.
	The match was due to start on a pitch with much more grass than usual for an Adelaide Oval surface, with Cricket Australia keen to ensure the pink ball is given every opportunity to hold its colour throughout the innings.
	Australia 1 Joe Burns, 2 David Warner, 3 Steven Smith (capt), 4 Shaun Marsh, 5 Adam Voges, 6 Mitchell Marsh, 7 Peter Nevill (wk), 8 Mitchell Starc, 9 Peter Siddle, 10 Josh Hazlewood, 11 Nathan Lyon

Many other key indicators too witnessed significant improvements. The net operating income for the period was Rs.780 million  representing an expansion of 21 percent YoY.

Welcoming the charterholders, CFA Society Sri Lanka President Sanjay Kulatunga said, This year we have added yet another seven passed finalists and 20 charterholders to the growing roster of CFAs within the capital market industry and I dare say even the wider corporate sectors of our country. I would like to congratulate all of charter recipients and passed finalists in having reached the culmination of a rigorous programme of study over three years. I would also like to remind you that the rewards of what you have achieved today will only manifest in the manner with which you translate this achievement into professional and even selfless conduct. 
He urged the new charterholders and passed finalists to help lead the industry by always putting investor interests first and to actively participate in society activities towards enhancing knowledge and promoting ethical behaviour.CFA Charterholders 2015
Orator for the evening, Tata Sons Director Ramabadran Gopalakrishnan was inspiring with his examples of life lessons, including realizing personal potential and achieving work-life balance. Instilling the importance of ethics by sharing a real-life story, he showed extraordinary human accomplishments that have questioned the relationship between fact and opinion.
As you strive in your career for accomplishment, recognition and advancement, remember there is no better yardstick than what you have set in your own mind. It is important for all of us to take pride from our accomplishments, rather than expend mental energy to be one up on our peer.
He kept the audience enthralled when he questioned the part played by luck in life. Do you need to be lucky to get what you want or is your destiny in your hands he asked. You need a stroke of luck to get what you want. Sure, you have to do your very best but there is no assurance of success, whatever your definition of success may be. The absence of the luck factor can deny you the rewards that you seek through your hard work and persistence. If that happens, just move on with your life. You would be wise to remember that the two opposites co-exist.
He concluded by reiterating that obligation is more important than entitlement, sharing his learnings on critical management lessons through mistakes and errors in judgment and the importance of being a good subordinate in order to be an even better boss.
When your consciousness and focus in any relationship is driven by what the other person owes you rather than what you owe that person, then that is asymmetry. Such unbalanced expectations merit some thought because the asymmetry is the cause of strife and disappointment. It is extremely important for any good subordinate to think about the boss needs as much as he or she would like the boss to think of his or her need.
To earn the CFA charter, candidates must sequentially pass three six-hour examinations which are widely considered to be the most rigorous in the investment profession. The CFA curriculum includes ethical and professional standards, financial reporting and analysis, corporate finance, economics, quantitative methods, equity, fixed income, alternative investments, derivatives, portfolio management and wealth planning. Currently, more than 120,000 investment professionals in 149 nations and territories hold the CFA charter.
