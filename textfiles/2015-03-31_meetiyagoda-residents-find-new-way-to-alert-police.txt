Residents of Meetiyagoda, which is under a cloud after revelations of systemic terror unleashed on residents by gangs, now  supply information to Police on the underworld by cutting letters out of papers to withhold their identities.
Earlier this year parents of two children were murdered in broad daylight in the village.
The villagers allege that they are under a reign of terror with underworld gangs roaming freely in the area and terrorizing villagers.
The villagers have used the method of cutting letters from newspaper stories to form sentences and alert the Police.
Villagers allege that the underworld gangs still roam around freely.
Banners denouncing the actions of the said gangs have been brought down in broad daylight reigniting the fear psychosis among the villagers.(Janak De Silva)
