Following the discussions with Transport Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva this evening, the All Ceylon Private Bus Association (ACPBA) decided to cancel its scheduled strike, which was scheduled to start midnight today.

Speaking to the Daily Mirror ACPBA Secretary Anjana Priyanjith said the bus associations had agreed to Minister’s decision on amending the bus fare by 12 percent with the minimum fare being Rs. 12 with the effect from May 22 midnight.

Earlier, the bus associations announced that they would go on a countrywide bus strike from midnight  today demanding minimum fare of Rs. 15 and 15 percent hike.

While holding a media briefing this evening at Narahenpita, the bus associations said they would not stop the strike until the Government reconsidered increasing the minimum fare.

However, a meeting with the Transport Deputy Minister Asoka Abeysinghe failed. During the meeting, the Minister had requested the bus associations to wait until next Tuesday (22) for a final decision.

The bus associations and the IPPBA said that they would not to wait.

“Waiting for Ministers’ decision till Tuesday is not reasonable and we should get the final decision today to change the decision of tonight’s strike,” Mr Priyanjith said then.

However, following a meeting with the Transport Minister later bus associations decided to cancel the planned strike. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)
