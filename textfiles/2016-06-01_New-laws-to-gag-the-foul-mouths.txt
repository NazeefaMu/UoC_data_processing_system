New laws to gag the foul mouths


	



 

A young purohita had to tender an apology in the House the other day for hurling an obscenity at a former purohita when, of course, disciplinary action by the chair was staring him in the face. 

 


Two other Diyawanna members – both former purohitas – too are facing belated disciplinary action by the chair for mouthing obscenities in the House, they say.


One of them had used obscene words to abuse a no lesser person than the country’s Big Boss.  The other one had uttered obscenities when he turned abusive towards several government bigwigs at one go. 


A decision has already been taken by high political authorities to beef up the relevant laws to enable taking deterrent action against the members using foul language during the sessions in the august assembly, they say.
