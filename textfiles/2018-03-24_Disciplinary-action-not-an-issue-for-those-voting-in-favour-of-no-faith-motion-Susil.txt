Disciplinary action would not be an issue for those who sign the no confidence motion against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, UPFA Parliamentarian, Minister of Science, Technology and Research A. D. Susil Premajayantha said yesterday.

The Minister said the main allegations of the no confidence motion depended on the Bond scam and the current situation would not have occurred if it was resolved in the first place.

He said there were two major parties and several small parties in the unity government which have their own party principles, however sometimes confrontations can occur.

“We always try to come to a common understanding. When we fail, disagreements like this can occur,” he added. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
