Call of the Coir

"Actually coconut tree is a "Kapruka" (Tree of Life) for me. My family and I depend on this. We make various products such as brooms, carpets, wall hangings and brushes and sell them at the village fair or take them from house to house and sell..."
His voice tells us the story of traditional coir community. The traditional coir industry has a long history of more than 100 years. Piyasena, 52, who hails from Ambalangoda is one of the thousands who make a living out of coir.
Coconut is highly valued and spoken of with great respect. More than as a source of food and medicine, it is recognized for its cultural significance and economic importance.
Fibre extracted from the outer layer of the coconut is known as coir fibre. It is used to manufacture various artistic and other useful products. Sri Lankan coconut coir and coir-based product manufacturers have been known well for centuries.

Sunil Shantha from Akurala, Ambalangoda, who is a 65-year-old coir product manufacturer, said he started making brooms and carpets at the age of 15.
His father was a well-known carpet manufacturer in the area. Without the Government support, he said that it is difficult to sustain the industry.
Forty two-year-old Ranjan de Silva from Kandegoda said he started making coir products at the age of 12 and he learned the art of making carpets and brooms from his grandfather. He has been in the industry for the past 30 years, but unlike in the past they eke out to meet their daily expenses.
He remarked that the synthetic products have taken a toll on the coir industry as well as the environment. If the Government can control the importation of synthetic products, things will be a bit rosier, he said.
C. Nihal Mendis, a coconut mill owner from Kahawa, said that he manufactures products to the international market. But he could not export his products directly due to financial difficulties.
"I have all the machines required for manufacturing good products to the international market. But I export my products through a mediator. My coir mill has already provided employment opportunities for around 25 workers. But if I could start direct exporting I could provide job opportunities for more workers and also be able to bring good foreign exchange to the country. There is a huge demand for our coir products especially in countries such as UK and Australia," he said.
He said it was pathetic to say that not a single official of the Divisional Secretariat in his area or a Provincial Council takes interest in solving the issues of coir manufacturers.
He also urged local authorities to help coir products manufacturers financially to expand the industry. Since there is a significant drop in sales, some manufacturers do not get a proper monthly income.
"I have a highly advanced machine used for manufacturing geo textile and we export them. Geo textile is a blanket made out of coir fibre, widely used to prevent soil erosion. South Korea, US, Netherland, Germany and Spain are the main buyers of our geotextile products," he said.
According to the Export Development Board, Sri Lanka is the largest supplier of brown fibre to the world with annual exports of fibre of more than 100,000 mt. The country is also famous for its value added coir products such as coir twine, brushes, brooms, coir mats, rugs and geotextiles.
Sri Lanka also produces a range of rubberized coir-based horticulture products such as coir pots, baskets, basket liners, seed trays, hanging baskets, weed control mats and coir poles.
"Sri Lanka is world's largest exporter of coir fibre. Yet, Sri Lanka's coir industry is in urgent need for infrastructure upgrading for it to sustain its coir supremacy. New technology infusion to our coir sector can greatly enhance our coir demand in the competitive global marketplace." EDB spokesperson said.
The production of coir and associated products has flourished in the Southern coastal belt and in the districts of Kurunegala and Puttalam. Coir products are exported and used to make carpets, doormats and decorative items. Coir products can be found in every village market place since they are effective, inexpensive and highly utilitarian.
Industrial Development Board (IDB) has taken various measures to uplift country's coir industry. IDB also provides training programmes for industrialists and improves management skill of coir mill owners, according to its Deputy Director M G Bandula.
"We also provide financial assistance by introducing low interest loan schemes in cooperation with state banks. We annually organize various competitions such as best entrepreneur of the year to encourage those who engage in the industry," he elaborated.
He added that the coconut-based industries play a vital role in sustaining a viable economy at all levels. Production sector is the largest which comprises two sub sectors where the formal sector representing coconut based manufacturing industries for export markets, and informal sector representing mostly cottage based industries engaged in the manufacture of products and by products for the local market.
Meanwhile Galle district has long been one of the country's principle coir producing and processing area with around 20-30 coir mills ranging from large exporting firms to household producing and processing coir. Some have fully mechanized, but many units at cottage and household levels still operate with traditional producing methods or immediate technologies at best.
"People those who do it as a household business earn only about 100-150 rupees per day. Craftsmen manufacturing carpets, brooms and other handicrafts can earn around 200-250 rupees per day. Workers at the coir mills earn Rs 400 or 500 a day," he added.
National Crafts Council Assistant Director (Southern Province) K M G Kamal said that the National Crafts Council provides assistance for those who produce coir based artistic handicrafts by providing training and market opportunities for them.
"There are about 100 coir product manufacturers in the districts and we have registered them at the National Crafts Council. So the Crafts Council provides opportunities for them to sell their products at its island wide sales outlets and Laksala also provide opportunities for them to sell their products. We also organize exhibitions and trade fairs in every three months to promote these products and generate more and more market opportunities for these craftsmen. We also provide opportunities for them to exhibit their products at foreign exhibitions especially in India," he said.
