Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe has recommended to President Maithripala Sirisena to cancel Gazette No: 851 issued by the then English Governor Robert Brownrigg in January 10, 1818 naming Keppetipola Disawe and 18 other Sinhala leaders as traitors.

The 19 Kandyan leaders were considered as traitors by the British Government for the mission they launched to free the nation in 1818, three years after the Kandyan Convention was signed making Sri Lanka a British colony.
Governor Brownrigg issued the gazette after having considered the mission of the Sinhalese leaders as a riot against the crown.

“For almost 200 years, the leaders who fought for the nation have been named as traitors. Therefore, the minister, in his capacity as the justice minister, has recommended to the President to cancel the gazette and bestow the title of ‘national hero’ on the 19 leaders,” a statement by the Ministry said today.

It said the decision was taken to deliver justice to these leaders and their descendants for the maltreatment and injustice they underwent during the British rule and to recognize them as national heroes who fought for the freedom and integrity of the country.

“Keppetipola Disawe, Kiwlegedara Mohottaale, Godagedara Rate Adikaram led the freedom struggle against the British for maintaining a strict administration violating the agreements of the Kandyan Convention,” the statement said.

Minister Rajapakshe has recommended that the status of national hero be bestowed on Keppetipola Disawe, Kiwlegedara Mohottale, Godagedara Rate Adikaram, Ketakala Mohottaale, Maha Bethmaraale, Kuda Bethmaraale, Polgolla Mohottaale, Watte Kale Mohottaale, Polgahagedara Rehenaraale, Posrewatta Vidane, Yalagombe Mohottaale, Udumadure Mohottaale, Kohukumbure Rateraale, Kohukumbure Walawwe Mohottaale, Butuwe Rateraale, Baginigahawela Rateraala, Mahabadulle Gammane Rateraale, Bulupitiye Mohottaale and Palle Melheyaye Gamethiraale.

Meanwhile, the ministry requested the public to notify the ministry secretary of details of family members, relatives and descendants of Keppetipola Disawe and other Kandyan leaders who launched the freedom struggle in 1818. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
