Sammy calls for one last effort from his team

West Indies will return to the venue which holds special memories for them when they confront Sri Lanka in the second T20 International at the R Premadasa Stadium today.
Three years ago West Indies stunned the world when they beat favourites Sri Lanka to win the ICC World T20 title.
Darren Sammy, the West Indies T20 captain is mindful of that victory and is urging his team to live upto those memories and try and win at least one match on the tour which has turned out to be a winless one for them so far.
West Indies lost the two-Test series 0-2 and the three-match ODI series 0-3 and trail 0-1 in the two-match T20I series having lost the first game to Sri Lanka by 30 runs at Pallekele on Monday.
“We believe we can be victories in Colombo, a place that is very special to us,” said Sammy. “It is the same scenario - they defeated us here (Pallakele) in the round matches and then we defeated them in the final, we just have to do it again to level the series.
“We believe in ourselves just have to come out again and get the basics rights. It will be good to get some form of success on the tour and go home on a winning note,” he said.
Sammy said although his team finished on the losing side that it was a good effort coming from a team that had not played together for quite a long time.
“We played the no. 1 team in the world and some of us were quite rusty we have not played T20 cricket for almost 8-10 months,” said Sammy. “We believe if we bat properly we once chased down 236 runs, we can win.
If we had wickets in hand and built batting partnerships like they (Sri Lanka) did we had a chance. You look at the last six overs the last 4-5 overs the tailenders were batting and 30 odd runs in T20 cricket is two big overs,” he said.
ONE CHANGE IN SRI LANKA SQUAD
Fast bowler Binura Fernando has been replaced by Dasun Shanaka in the Sri Lanka squad. Fernando is suffering from a hamstring injury and will not be available for selection, a SLC communique states.
