Several areas in Kautara, Colombo, Matara, Galle, Ampara and Polonnaruwa districts had suffered power failures due to rainy weather condition yesterday, the Power and Renewable Energy Ministry said today.

Ministry Development Director Sulakshana Jayawardena told Daily Mirror that the CEB Workers’ strike action was not the cause of the power failure and added that they managed to restore power supply in few affected areas with the support of employees who were not supporting the strike action.
