Govt aims comprehensive relief package for all - Ravi

The first step of the government's long term plan to uplift the living standard of people will be taken at the 2016 budget, Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said.
The minister made this assurance at a meeting with ministry officials regarding the proposals received from various parties to be incorporated in the budget.
Karunanayake said the government's aim is to introduce a comprehensive relief package covering all sections of the society.
While claiming that the proposals of the people are pouring in subsequent to a request to that effect, the Finance Minister added that such proposals will help the budget to be more people oriented and contribute to the country's onward journey.
The ministry has received over 1,000 proposals to be incorporated into the 2016 budget from diverse sectors including the public, institutions and organisations.
Minister Karunanayake said the proposals would be given due consideration under 10 broad categories.
Generation of employment opportunities and associated problems, reforms in the public sector, infrastructure development, financial sector, agriculture, investment promotion and industries and medium scale industry development are these thrust areas.
Karunanayake will present the 2016 budget to Parliament on November 20.
