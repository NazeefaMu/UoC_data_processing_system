Everyone knows who tried to use black-magic against me: President


	

President Maithripala Sirisena was of the view that those persons who had failed in their efforts to challenge his leadership since his nomination as the common candidate for the Presidency have now resorted to black magic and the country knows who the culprits are.

The President made these comments at an event to celebrate the 38th anniversary of the ITN (Independent Television Network), where he also declared open a new

five-storyed building in the ITN premises.

The President said he read the news about black magic being used to displace him in the morning papers and regarded it as a foolish deed but warned that he would never be shaken by these actions but rather it would only help to spur him on to achieve greater things in the future.
