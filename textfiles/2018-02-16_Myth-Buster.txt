MYTH: “Carbonated diet drinks are fine because they don’t have excess calories.

BUSTED: “This is not true. Carbonated diet soft drinks may not contain calories, but they tend to contain a lot of artificial sweeteners. These can surely be consumed to quench your thirst, but the rule here is that you limit their intake. Just as there are advantages and disadvantages to everything, the advantage here is that these carbonated diet drinks contain next-to-non calories. The downsides to these drinks are that they contain a fair amount of phosphoric acid which softens tooth enamel & promotes plaque formation. Carbonated drinks aren’t very good for your teeth. Because these drinks don’t contain any other nutrients other than empty calories, you can always opt for healthier alternatives such as natural fruit juices or daily based products,” said Doctor Anoma Chandrasekara, a nutritionist and current Departmental Head of Applied Nutrition, Wayamba University.
