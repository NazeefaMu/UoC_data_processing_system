The ghosts of previous regime were still haunting the country as seen in the recent attack on Dr. Nirmal Ranjith Dewasiri and Dr. Kusum Kumara at Kirulapone on the May Day, Venerable Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera said today.
The Chairman of National Movement for Social Justice Ven. Sobitha Thera also accused the attackers of continuing the practice of the former President to silence the people who had different opinions using violence.
“Such incidents are not new to us as we had experienced a cruel time, where all the democratic rights to speak, write, and hold meetings were violated. But, it is sorrowful when such incidents are still happening in the Yahapalana government as well,” he said.
He was speaking at a joint press briefing held with the participation of Federation of University Teachers’ Associations (FUTA), Ceylon Teachers Union, National Movement for Social Justice, Inter-University Students Federation (IUSF) and several other trade unions, condemning the attack and urging an immediate probe into the incident.
Speaking to the media, Deputy President of the FUTA Ven. Dambara Amila Thera requested MPs Wimal Weerawansa, Dinesh Gunawardane and Vasudewa Nayakkara to come to consciousness without wasting time to get their so-called leader back into power.
“At least now, the henchmen of former President should change their minds and follow the correct path. Because, it is impossible to realise their dream of getting their lost leader back into politics since the people have understood the truth,” Amila Thera said.
He condemned the attack which he said “showed a lack of respect for political dissent” and “complete intolerance of political opposition.”(Piyumi Fonseka)
