Stars kindle his political ambitions


	


This Betel Leaf man from a prominent political family in the Gampaha district secured a Diyawanna seat at the last general poll.  It was for him a jump from provincial politics to national politics.
A detractor of the new Big Boss, this politico recently had called on a well-known astrologer to get a reading of his political future. And the astrologer had predicted that he was destined to occupy the second highest chair in the country one day. Incidentally, another astrologer whom he consulted some time ago too had made the same prediction.
These days the highly elated politico is exploring short-cuts to attaining the position that the star-gazers had predicted, they say.
