Two imposters in an alumni list!


	



 

A high seat of learning in the city recently decided to bring out a publication containing the profiles of its alumni who had brought honour to it by becoming members of the Diyawanna council. 

 


Later the head of this high seat of learning had sent a written request to the Diyawanna authorities to provide them with a list of Diyawanna members, who had passed out as graduates from this institution. 


On receipt of the list of graduates sent by the Diyawanna authorities, the institution’s counterparts had carefully gone through the list and had grown suspicious about two names in the list. On double-checking the two names, they could rule out the possibility of the two Diyawanna members in question having ever stepped into the institution’s building complex even by accident seeking shelter from a downpour! 


One of these imposters is now a State purohita hailing from Wayamba. A former top team member, he had contested at the last general poll on the Betel leaf list. 


The other imposter, a Green party new comer to Diyawanna hails from the main city in the South.  By the way, this member got a reprimand from the party hierarchy quite recently for going on a foreign jaunt without the permission from the party. 


Discreet inquiries have now begun to find out how the names of these two members found their way into the alumni list of the prestigious high seat of learning in the city.
