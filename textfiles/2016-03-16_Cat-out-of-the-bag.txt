Cat out of the bag?


	



 

This one made it to Diyawanna from the hills and now he is a bearer of an important office. 

 


There was bereavement in his family recently.  And many government bigwigs attended the funeral.
A group of Diyawanna members including some purohitas in yahapalanaya who visited the funeral house the night before the day of the obsequies had a drink too many before they were drawn into an animated political discussion. 


One of them during the discussion said: “We accepted portfolios on the advice of our former boss. He asked us to hold them until he gives the signal to quit…”


Several other purohitas present had nodded, but observed a discreet silence, they say.
