Is the gaffe a slip of the tongue?


	



 

It is now well-known that the prison authorities are now ready with a list of 18 death row heroin convicts due to meet with imminent punishment according to an edict issued by Number One. 

 


And this group condemned to imminent death is generally referred to as ‘Daha-ate Kalliya ‘(the clique of 18) these days.


By the way, the 16 Blue party dissidents who recently broke away from yahapalanaya to team up with the JO are generally referred to as the ‘Dasaye Kalliya’ (the clique of 16). 


There is a leading top team member in yahapalanaya who, they say, often mixes up the ‘Daha-ate-Kalliya’ with the ‘Dasaye Kalliya’ whenever he addresses a public event. While, on the subject of death penalty, this purohita would declare that the ‘Dasaye Kalliya’ should be sent to gallows and at times a colleague seated close to him would whisper into his ear that he had mistakenly referred to the wrong ‘Kalliya’ and then he would hasten to correct himself.


The gaffe this politico makes is generally considered as a serious slip of the tongue given his stance against the Group 16 is as much known as his advocacy of death for drug addicts!
