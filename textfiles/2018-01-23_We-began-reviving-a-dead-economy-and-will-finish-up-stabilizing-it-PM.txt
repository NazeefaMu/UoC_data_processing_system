The present regime in its present form was able start up the economy which was on a standstill and will end up stabilizing it by showing budget surpluses by 2020, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said yesterday.

The Prime Minister made this speech at an election rally in Gonawala organized by UNP’s Biyagama Organizer Ruwan Wijewardene last evening.

“We did not take over a stable government but an economy which was on a standstill just like a power station with broken generators. Generator of the power station which is called the economy is development. This power station was on a standstill when we took over the government as the country was in a debt trap and as there were no investors. However we have managed to fuel this power plant with investments and by settling the debts. We will complete what we started and will end up showing a budget surplus by 2020,” the Prime Minister said.

He said the previous government borrowed funds and constructed a port without ships and an airport without planes. “This is like mixing water with kerosene. However when we took over we managed to show an excess in primary accounts by making difficult decisions such as increasing VAT,” he said.

Mr Wickremesinghe added that countries such as China, India and Japan had come to assist Sri Lanka after the government signed an agreement with IMF. All these countries will not help Sri Lanka if the agreement with IMF is abolished. He said the exports have increased by US $ 15 billion and the government’s target is to increase it up to $ 20 to 30 billion.

The Prime Minister then went on to focus on the development plans of the government and said a net work of highways will be established from Kandy to Hambantota. He said industrial zones will be set up around this network.

Venerable Dambara Amila Thera who was seen at the UNP stage for the first time said people should not get angry with President Maithripala Sirisena for what he says as he cannot shuffle the ministries without consulting the Prime Minister under the 19th Amendment to the constitution.

Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka said all those who have been charged with corruption including those in the previous government will be in jail by 2020. (Yohan Perera)
