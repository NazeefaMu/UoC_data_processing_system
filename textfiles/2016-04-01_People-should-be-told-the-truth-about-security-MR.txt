While ruling a country it is important to consider the physical, social development of the country in addition to national security.

Today we suspect that an issue relating to the national security of the country has surfaced
With the discovery of explosives and a suicide kit in the north it is essential that the public be kept informed of the actual security situation,” said former President Mahinda Rajapaksa during a Bodhi Pooja held at the Pinwatte Purana Raja Maha Viharaya in Dehiwala yesterday.

The former President also said that this incident should not be regarded as something trivial, and suitable action should be taken to dispel the suspicion and the fear that is now developing in the country.

He said the people are intelligent enough to understand when a threat is posed to national security. Therefore it is vital for the government to keep the people informed about the correct situation, without accusing others and attempting to lock them up. (H M Dharmapala)
