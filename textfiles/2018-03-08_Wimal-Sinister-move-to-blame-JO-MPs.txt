Wimal: Sinister move to blame JO MPs


	

There was a sinister move to blame two Opposition MPs for the violence in Kandy, Joint Opposition MP Wimal Weerawansa told Parliament yesterday.

"The Government is trying to get away by blaming Opposition MPs Lohan Ratwatte and Dilum Amunugama for the violence in Kandy," MP Weerawansa said.

He charged that the Police have been advised to prepare the reports accordingly.

"The Government is fully aware as to who is behind the violence," he added.

He said concerns were raised by Sinhalese on the sudden changes of Muslim women's attire and the introduction of Arabian culture to Sri Lanka lately.

He said the present Government had done nothing to defuse the tension. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)
