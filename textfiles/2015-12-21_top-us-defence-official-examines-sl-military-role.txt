US Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defence (DASD) for South and Sout Eeast Asia Dr. Amy Searight, who concluded her three-day visit to Sri Lanka on Saturday, examined the future role of Sri Lankan security forces, the US embassy said today.
“During her visit, Dr. Searight examined the future role Sri Lankan security forces could play in humanitarian assistance, responding to natural disasters and increased participation in overseas peace keeping operations,” a statement said.
Dr. Searight met Defence Secretary Karunasena Hettiarachchi and Foreign Secretary Chitranganee Wagiswara to discuss the Sri Lankan government’s efforts on security sector reforms, as well as training and getting personnel for United Nations peacekeeping operations. DASD Searight paid official calls upon the Chief of Defence Staff, and the respective Tri-Service Commanders, to stress the need for land returns, reconciliation and a credible transitional justice mechanism, and to discuss future security requirements. She had dinner with Deputy Foreign Minister, Dr. Harsha De Silva, State Minister of Defence, Ruwan Wijewardene and State Enterprise Development Deputy Minister Eran Wickramaratne.
DASD Searight placed a priority on meeting with human rights activists and emphasized the “key role civil society plays in informing military policy and defence relationships.” She raised concerns about accountability and reconciliation efforts during discussions with senior military leaders. During discussions with the NGOs involved in de-mining, DASD Searight discussed ongoing demining work in the Northern and Eastern Sri Lanka and reaffirmed “the United States was committed to addressing the landmine problem in Sri Lanka,” which since 1993 had received U.S. assistance worth 6 billion rupees ($43 million). She concluded her visit by travelling to the Institute for Peace Support Operations Training – Sri Lanka, where forces are trained prior to joining UN peace-keeping missions, the statement added.
