Dinesh wants MR's security strengthened


	

Joint opposition MP Dinesh Gunawardane today requested Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to strengthen former president Mahinda Rajapaksa's security considering the security threat to his life when participating at JO election rallies for the LG elections.

He told parliament that the security forces were finding it difficult to prevent people from entering high security zones and maintaining no-go areas at the rallies which would be attended by Mr. Rajapaksa.

The MP said the government and the security forces should understand this situation and take steps to provide an higher level of security with more back-up vehicles.

The Prime Minister said security had been provided to former presidents Rajapaksa and Chandrika Kumaratunge based on threat assessment reports submitted by the intelligence units.

He said Mr. Rajapaksa's security detail consisted of 154 security personnel including an ASP, a Chief Inspector, nine IPs, 14 SIs and 31 police sergeants.

The Prime Minister said Ms. Kumaratunge had been provided with only 61 security personnel while Mr. Rajapaksa had been provided with more security after considering the threat assessment on his life.

He said no formal request had been made to the Law and Order Ministry regarding his security and it could be considered if such a request was made.

The MP said it would be important if the previously reduced security detail would be restored during the election period. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)
