Minister of Regional Development, Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka yesterday said the President, Army Chief and members of the armed services and all other citizens in the country should be under the country’s law and there is no need to have any separate investigation boards as Parliamentarian Ven. Athuraliye Rathana Thera had suggested.

While addressing the media at the Government Information Department in Narahenpita, Minister Sarath Fonseka said no one is above the county’s law.

referring to the statement made by the Ven. Rathana Thera yesterday Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka said it is not fair to make such statements by the Thera.

Ven. Rathana Thera yesterday suggested to have a separate investigation board to probe the issues involving military intelligence personnel.

Minister Fonseka said, even Buddhist Priests have to face the same consequences if they breached the country’s law. Buddhist Priests would not be tried by the Sangadhikaranaya. Already there are about 80 Buddhist priests in the Welikada prison.

“I personally respect the Ven. Rathana Thera as a Buddhist priest, but he is not a person with military expertise. If the Thera says anything against the war and the arrest of the military intelligence personnel, he is expressing the ideas of the Joint Opposition and making statements while keeping a totally different agenda in his mind,” he said.

If the Thera wants to make such statements he should resign from the government. He cannot make such statements while being a member of the government. (Chaturanga Pradeep)
