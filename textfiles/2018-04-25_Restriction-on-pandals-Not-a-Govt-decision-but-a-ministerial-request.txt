Restriction on pandals: Not a Govt. decision, but a ministerial request


	

While stating that the proposal to restrict Pandals on Vesak and Poson Poya Days is not a governmental decision, but a ministerial request made to people, Buddhasasana Minister Gamini Jayawickrama Perera today said the request to restrict pandals on Vesak and Poson Poya Days still remain.

Minister Perera earlier said the pandals would be prohibited on Vesak and Poson Poya Days whilst the Government Information Department said the government had not taken a policy decision to ban dansals and pandals on Vesak and on Poson Poya Days.

He said there was no prohibition on pandals on these specific days but people were requested to not to put up pandals only on Vesak (April 29) and Poson (May 29) Poya Days to stress on the need to focus on the spiritual aspect of religion rather than on mundane activities.

“We have made this request to people following a request by the Mahanayake Theras. It is up to the people to decide on whether to do it or not. However, dansals can be held on these days without any restriction,” he said.

The proposal by Minister Perera to the Cabinet on Tuesday banning Vesak Pandals and Danasalas was turned down by the Ministers severely objecting to the proposal.

Meanwhile, Buddhist Affairs Commissioner General Nimal Kotawalagedara requested the people who were organizing dansals, not to use Buddhist flags in dansals but to use a yellow colour flag. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)
