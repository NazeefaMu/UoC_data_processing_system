JVP MP Bimal Ratnayake said yesterday the verdict of the Supreme Court on the dissolution of parliament should be made available to MPs and the people in all three languages and said the SC verdict had rescued the country from an impending international trap.

He told Parliament that the SC verdict had sent a clear signal to the international community that our judicial system was independent.

"Our judicial system had been vilified at international level in the past and the government had been urged to call in international judges to hear cases of war crimes against our security forces. But this verdict has proved that we have an independent judiciary which is impartial," he said.

Speaking during the debate on the Vote on Account, MP Ratnayake said the JVP could not support the Vote on Account as it was a mini budget to carry forward the UNP's programmes rather than allocating money only to pay salaries of government servants, pensioners and Samurdhi relief.

"We have voted against the budgets of the government so far, and we will vote against this as well. If it was only to pay salaries, we have no reason to object," he said. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)
