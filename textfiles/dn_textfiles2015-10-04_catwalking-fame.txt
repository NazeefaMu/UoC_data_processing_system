A: Happy
Q: How did you get chosen to represent Sri Lanka at the Miss Tourism Universe pageant?
A: I stepped into the world of modeling through Derana Miss Sri Lanka for Miss Earth winning 2nd Runner Up. But I was sent to Lebanon for Miss Tourism Universe 2015 by Brian Kerkoven and Asanka Athapattu who were the local franchise directors for Miss Tourism.
Q: Did you always want to do something like this - get into a beauty pageant?
A: No, my parents opened this new door for me when I said I can’t. They believe in me and I somehow came to a certain level in a very short period.
Q: What was going through your mind when you realized that you had to represent Sri Lanka at an International Competition and competing with so many other countries?
A: Was a bit scared but I was happy a girl like me with no experience in the modeling field was lucky enough to represent Sri Lanka.

A: Neither. I’m not used to both. I rarely go out with friends and parties. I simply spend time with my family. But I do make a lot of friends.
Q: Do you like animals and do you have any?
A: Yes I love them. I am mostly in love with stray doggies as I love taking care of them. And yes I have a doggie named Shola (street dog). I love her lot.

A: A future full of challenges.
Q: Motto in life?
A: Keep moving forward no matter what happens - just keep going. And don’t let dreams just be dreams. If you can dream then sure yes you can make it a reality. Never give up!
