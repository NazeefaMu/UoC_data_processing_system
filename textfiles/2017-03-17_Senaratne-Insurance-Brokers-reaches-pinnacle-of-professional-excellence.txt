Senaratne Insurance Brokers reaches pinnacle of professional excellence


	

Senaratne Insurance Brokers (Pvt.) Ltd has recently been awarded the prestigious Corporate Chartered Insurance Brokers designation by the Chartered Insurance Institute in the UK, the first to be so recognized. 
This is the Gold standard for insurance brokers. It confirms that it has satisfied vigorous qualification criteria by retaining highly qualified staff, who subscribe to the membership conditions of the Chartered Insurance Institute with adherence to an industry standard code of ethics, reinforcing the highest standards of professional practice in their business dealings.  
This institute has a membership of over 120,000 members in more than 150 countries and is the world’s largest professional body, dedicated to insurance.  In this context, it is useful to add that only close to 200 firms have achieved the Corporate Chartered status, indicating that this is a highly exclusive award reserved for the leading firms in the insurance broking industry. 
When any person seeks to arrange an insurance cover through a Chartered firm, it should be borne in mind that they are dealing with proven professionals. The Chartered Insurance Institute is empowered by the Privy Council to award the Chartered status and such award is only made in deserving cases.  
While Chartered titles are indeed steeped in history, these remain the bench mark of professional excellence and integrity. Senaratne Insurance Brokers (Pvt.) Ltd specializes in providing independent advice on all types of insurance for individuals and businesses.
Nihal Senaratne, who is Founder President of this company, said that securing the Corporate Chartered Insurance status is a landmark for his company. 
“We have always prided ourselves on being thoroughly professional in everything we do and to receive external recognition in this way is most gratifying.  As Corporate Chartered Insurance Brokers, we can signal our commitment to the highest levels of service to our customers.”
