A mission that went haywire


	



 

Two Diyawanna members, one from the North and the other from the upcountry estate domain had left their homes for Colombo on November 9 to carry out a mission which could have marked a landmark event in the country’s political history if it had succeeded, they say. 

 


The Diyawanna member from the North in question was a character carrying a chip on his shoulder against his political party. The politico from the estate sector is an ambitious one always set to sail with the winds. However, a message the duo had received just on arrival in the city that the gazette notification dissolving the Parliament had reached the Government Printer brought their mission to naught, they say.
