Reduce speed when driving on Southern Expressway: RDA


	

The Road Development Authority (RDA) had requested drivers using the Southern Expressway to make sure they switch on their headlights due to the gloomy, misty nature in the air which makes visibility difficult and driving hazardous due to the bad weather prevailing at present.

Director of Operations and Maintenance of the RDA Saman Opatha had further instructed drivers to reduce their speeds to below 60 kmph, especially at places on the road that had collected water, thereby making it tough to drive through. (Jayantha Samarakoon)
