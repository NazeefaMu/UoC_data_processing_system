Former Western Province Chief Minister Prasanna Ranatunga, who was elected to Parliament on the United People’s Freedom Alliance (UPFA) ticket, said he, along with others, would talk to Speaker Karu Jayasuriya about the opposition leadership post.
A section of the UPFA is opposed to the appointment of Tamil National Alliance (TNA) Leader R.Sampanthan to it. This group pushes for the appointment of Kalutara district MP Kumara Welgama to it.
Addressing a meeting in Gampaha, he said, he and the team would act as an opposition group though the UPFA had joined the National Unity Government with the UNP.
“The space to act according to conscience is getting contracted. We are not opposed to Mr. Sampanthan. Yet, the TNA –controlled Northern Provincial Council passed a resolution calling for an international war crime probe on Sri Lanka,” he said.
Noting that his party did not seek a mandate for a national government, he said though former President Mahinda Rajapaksa was faulted for creating a mega Cabinet, the very same had been done at the moment.
“I will continue to fight till a Prime Minister representing Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP)-led UPFA is appointed one day. Mr. Rajapaksa never acted in a manner inimical to the interests of SLFP. He is a leader with patience,” Mr. Ranatunga said. (Kelum Bandara)
