The computer-based test for obtaining driving licences would be held from tomorrow at the Werahera Branch, the Department of Motor Traffic (DMT) said.

Speaking to the Daily Mirror the Department said all preparations had been made to introduce the computer-based examination.

“143 computer terminals had been installed at the DMT Werahera Branch for this purpose,” an official said.

“The computer-based driving licence examination centre will be declared open by Transport Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva,” he said.

The new examination system will be introduced to other eight District Secretariats as well, which would be networked with the DMT head office. In the third phase of the programme, the system will be linked to all District Secretariats.

“The Department hopes to complete the installations island wide by 2020,” he said.

Candidates have to face a computer-based examination, where the computer will generate instant questions to evaluate the highway-code knowledge of the applicant on the theoretical part of driving skills.

“The results will appear online instantly after the exam,” he said. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)
