	The law on use of plastics and polythene bags less than 20 microns of gauge would be strictly implemented from January 1, on a Presidential directive, Mahaweli Development and Environment Ministry Director Anura Jayathilaka.
	He said, this during an inspection of several shops and shopping malls in Colombo.
	He said, laws would be enforced strictly from January 1 to minimise the use of polythene, which was a major threat to the environment and the health of the people.
	“According to the Gazettee notification No. 1466/5 issued under section 23W of the National Environmental Act No. 47 of 1980, the use of polythene less than 20 microns in thickness will be banned. Violators will be charged in courts and fined Rs. 10,000 as a penalty or face two years imprisonment or both,” he said.
	The legislation was brought in to combat the indiscriminate use of shopping bags and food wrappers in shopping malls and the home environment, resulting in its haphazard disposal polluting the environment.
	Instead it was recommended that people use environmentally friendly paper bags, and jute bags for shopping purposes.
	“However, the law to all intents and purposes was only on paper and died a natural death,” Anura Jayathilaka said.
	The regulation was also Gazetted under the provisions of the Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA) Act No 09 of 2003 by Gazette numbered 1588/18 and dated February 11, 2009, he said.
	According to the Act, the name and address of the manufacturer, date of manufacture, generic name of the product and Number of Environmental Protection License and other manufacturing details should be labeled on the packet or bundle of polythene food wrappers and garbage bag since August 15, 2009.
	“We request shop and shopping mall owners to obey the rules and help to protect the environment by minimising the use of polyethene,” he said.
	The inspection would be conducted in the Colombo City area and the Greater Colombo area as well.
	The inspection was conducted yesterday under the supervision of CMC Chief Medical officer, Ministry of Health, and Central Environmental Authority (CEA) and with the support of the environmental Police. (Chaturaga Pradeep)
