He is set to go ahead with the mega deal


	



 

A political authority responsible for a state undertaking tasked with facilitating public mobility is set to wrap up a mega transaction at the cost of several billions of rupees to the government coffers.

 


This state undertaking now being run at a huge loss depends on Treasury funds even to meet its EPF and ETF commitments, they say.


The political authority is dead set on purchasing at least 500 buses from a company in a neighbouring country at one go regardless of the huge cost involved.  However, the team at the top table in yahapalanaya had already taken a decision to purchase the vehicles required to strengthen the existing fleet in instalments from two companies. 


Disdaining the decision taken by the top team, the high-up is now poised to place the seal on the deal come hell or high water. And he had declared that he would quit his job if he were compelled to call off the deal. This senior political authority had earlier vowed that he would not run for a seat in the Diyawanna council in future.
