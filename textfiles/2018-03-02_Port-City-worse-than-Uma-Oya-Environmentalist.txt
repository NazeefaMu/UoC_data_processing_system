Port City worse than Uma Oya: Environmentalist


	

According to the current situation, the Port City project will cause worse environmental hazards than the Uma Oya project, said the People’s Movement Against Port City on Wednesday.

Commenting on this, environmentalist Sajeewa Chamikara said since 2011 they had been educating the civil society on the possible environmental damage this project could bring.

“The adverse environmental impacts we forecasted are taking place now. The coastal belt up to Ratmalana and Negombo is damaged and the waves and sea current have been irregular along these areas. However, the government has allocated a staggering Rs. 1,500 million from last year’s budget to prevent sea erosion. Water sources in Gampaha and Kalutara Districts are drying out as granite is supplied to the project. The Chinese company that has undertaken the project violates sand mining procedures. The government should intervene and bring this project to a halt at least now,” he said.

Meanwhile, Systems Ecologist Dr. Ranil Senanayake said the fine particulate matter (PM2.5) would be increased by 25 to 30 times due to this project and that would lead to severe health issues.

“The construction of skyscrapers and use of cement and other material contribute to the increase of fine particulate matter. Even now, the PM2.5 value is three times in Colombo. This spike will lead to cancer and respiratory problems of people. However, the project will surely be a tourist attraction if we can construct a green park in the project site,” he said.
