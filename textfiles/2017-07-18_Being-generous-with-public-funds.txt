Being generous with public funds


	



 

White collar ones attached to a state establishment handling an important function related to facts and figures are being sent in ten-member batches to Malaysia for training when there is a training centre for them located in a gem-rich district, they say.

 


The head of this establishment, a political appointee is said to be justifying this costly exercise saying: “Our own training centre is located at a distant place. Let our boys have a jolly good time abroad. After all, they also need a change!”


However, when it comes to picking the ‘boys’ for the training programme in Malaysia, this high-up is reportedly giving preference to his own favourites, some of them are on the verge of retirement while some others are very junior ones counting one or two years of service.
