Dr. Ananda Wijewickrema, Senior Consultant Physician, Head of the IDH Hospital and Specialist for Dengue, is a gentleman who takes his profession beyond the call of duty.

His research in the treatment of Dengue has won him many accolades, but what is outstanding is his management of patients back to normalcy and his passion to return them to their original standard of living at the earliest.

The ideal example is the opportunity he afforded his young patients waiting to sit for the GCE Ordinary Level examination last December.

The vulnerability and the emotional upheaval of patients, parents and caregivers were considered a priority by Dr Wijewickrema and his staff, who nurtured all according to the need of the hour.

In addition, Dr Wijewickrema organized a special section of the hospital in compliance with the Director of the Department of Examinations to facilitate a temporary centre for some of the dengue patients from schools across the island, with different curriculum to sit their GCE OL examination.

His sheer determination that these patients should not forego their year-long hard work in preparing for the exam was assisted with wheelchairs and the drip to complete the exam, regardless of the circumstances they encountered. Even patients under treatment at the peak of fever were given the assurance and the support, to complete the examinations.


 


The confidence exuded by Dr Wijewickrema gave additional confidence that the young patients required to face the examination under most difficult circumstances. It is noteworthy to mention that this kind, thoughtful doctor has given this opportunity to patients for the past three years



 

Parents of patients diagnosed with the bleeding type of dengue were given the reassurance, encouragement and all medical assistance to accept the challenge and complete the examination. The confidence exuded by Dr Wijewickrema gave the additional confidence that the young patients required to face the examination under most difficult circumstances. It is noteworthy to mention that this kind, thoughtful doctor has given this opportunity to patients for the past three years.

In today’s world, we so often hear about the negatives of the medical system. Well, not this time. Thanks to the compassion and dedication of Dr Ananda Wijewickrema and the medical staff of the Dengue Unit of the IDH Hospital, whose exceptional services are invaluable to our nation, it can be boldly stated that ‘lead by example’ is the most effective method of professionalism.
