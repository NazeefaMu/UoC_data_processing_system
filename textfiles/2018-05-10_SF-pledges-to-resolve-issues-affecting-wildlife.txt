Wildlife Minister Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka said yesterday he would resolve the issues affecting wildlife in the same manner he ended the 30-year-long civil war. He said this while participating at the ceremony in which Wildlife Deputy Minister Palitha Thewarapperuma assumed duties.

“The Wildlife Ministry has always had its own, unresolved problems. And following the recent Cabinet reshuffle, the ministry stole the limelight. Nevertheless, I am now vested with the responsibility of resolving burning wildlife issues including the human-elephant conflict. We will immediately look into some of the major concerns like the issues facing national parks including Yala. I will devise an effective mechanism to resolve any human-elephant conflict within 48 hours since it had transpired. Although I have a short spell of one and a half years to achieve all these, I am confident of making it happen,” he said. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)
