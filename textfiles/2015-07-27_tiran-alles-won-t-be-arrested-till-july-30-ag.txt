Tiran Alles won’t be arrested till July 30: AG


	

The Attorney General (AG) undertook not to arrest former MP Tiran Alles until July 30 in connection with an alleged fraud at the Reconstruction and Development Agency (RADA) when the matter was taken up in the Supreme Court today.
The Chief Justice was scheduled to sit on the bench when the matter was taken up. However, it was taken up before Judges Eva Wanasundare and Buwaneka Aluwihare instead.
Therefore, the matter is due to be taken up before the CJ on July 30. (Lakmal Sooriyagoda)
