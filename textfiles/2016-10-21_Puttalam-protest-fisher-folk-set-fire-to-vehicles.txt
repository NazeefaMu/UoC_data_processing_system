Fishermen in Kalapitiya engaged in a protest campaign against the use of illegal fishing methods have allegedly set fire to seven fishing boats, three motorcycles and a lorry.

The vehicles belong to other fishermen who allegedly use illegal fishing methods, it is learnt. The fishermen who have been out on the streets since yesterday had severely damaged the boats anchored at the harbor.     

A tense situation prevailed in the area this morning, which led to the Puttalam Police calling in the STF to control the situation.

Despite an interim order issued to prevent protestors from inconveniencing the public, the protestors blocked several roads in the area causing heavy traffic. (Padma Kumari)
