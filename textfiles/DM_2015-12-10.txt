Army is not there to provide protection to MPs: Ruwan
	
	Stating that the government had taken a decision to stop providing army security to individuals, State Defence Minister Ruwan Wijewardane today said that the army was not there to protect Parliamentarians, but to protect the nation.
	"Although i am the state minister of defence I have been given the same level of security that is provided to an MP," the minister said.
	The State Defence Minister made this comment at a ceremony to open a student's hostel complex at the Sir John Kotelawala Defence University in Ratmalana. The eight storey hostel complex of the Sir John Kothalawala Defence University was constructed according to a concept of the Vice Chancellor of the University, Milinda Peiris.
	The State Minister went on to say that the government had taken a decision to stop providing army security to individuals. He was referring to a story which had recently captured the attention of the nation with regards to the security given to former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. "The former President had been provided with adequate security, and while it is so a group of opposition members are charging that the government is not concerned about state security. Refuting all these allegations I would like to reiterate that President Maithripala Sirisena, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, myself and the defense secretary would never ever would allow any group or organization to interfere with our national security, he said.
	State Defence Minister Wijewardane also charged that the opposition had made much hue and cry saying that restrictions imposed on certain Diaspora organizations had been lifted, but the decision was taken after the report of a commission and discussing matters with the intelligence units.
	The detainees were released only subject to strict bail conditions and only through the judiciary process. He also recalled that before the 2010 elections 300 detainees were released without adhering to any of these regulations by the previous government, which he called a political ploy. However now they are released on bail and they have no chance of regrouping in order to do any harm to the unitary state of the country. The intelligence units are closely monitoring their movements, he assured. (Rekha Tharangani Fonseka)

Salman Khan acquitted of all charges in hit-and-run case
	
The Mumbai High Court has overturned Bollywood star Salman Khan's conviction for a 2002 hit-and-run case, BBC news reported.
In May, a lower court convicted him of culpable homicide and sentenced him to five years in jail for driving over and killing a man sleeping on a pavement.
But the appeal judges ruled there was not enough evidence.
It was only when the judge insisted that Salman Khan must be present before the verdict was read out, that the actor hurried to the court in south Mumbai on Thursday, the BBC's Yogita Limaye reports from Mumbai.
"The appeal is allowed and the decision of the trial court is quashed and set aside. Salman Khan is acquitted of all charges," news agency AFP quoted the Bombay high court judge Anil Ramchandra Joshi as saying.
Thursday's verdict is the latest twist in a case that began 13 years ago when Khan's Toyota Land Cruiser car veered off the road, killing one man and seriously injuring four others.
During his trial in the lower court, Khan had argued that his driver had been behind the wheel, but the judge said it was the actor who had been driving under the influence of alcohol.
Now the high court has now said that key evidence - including testimony from a policeman who has since died - was not reliable. The prosecution is likely to challenge the verdict, reports say.

## Title: GICS for Colombo bourse
## Section: Financial News
## Date: 10 December 2015 06:30 pm
GICS for Colombo bourse
	
		 		 
		 
			
The Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) adopts the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) to classify its listed companies. This was officially launched at the ceremony held on December 2, 2015 to mark the 30th anniversary of the CSE.Why sector classifications matter
You may have heard investment advisors and other investment gurus saying you should diversify your portfolio: this is commonly stated by the idiom Dont pull all your eggs in one basket. The idea is that if you dont put all your eggs in one basket, you are able to diversify your risk into different stocks or securities. Clearly your investment should be diversified across different business sectors. For example, having purchased only five banking stocks you cant say your portfolio is well diversified, because you are still exposed to just one industry, which is banking in this example.
Therefore, by diversifying your portfolio you can, and should spread your risk across different industry sectors. The fundamental idea behind this is the premise that all industries will not be doing bad simultaneously.
In order to facilitate investors to diversify investments across different industry sectors, stock markets all over the world classify companies into different business sectors.How important is to have a common standard
In the modern world, with the increased global focus of equity investments, geographical demarcations do not matter. Moreover, it is different industry sectors that play a crucial role.
However, across different geographies when different classifications are used comparisons are made difficult or sometimes impossible.
Hence, it is ideal to have a common classification which will make comparisons easy and meaningful.What is the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS)
The Global Industry Classification Standard or GICS in short, was jointly developed in 1999 by Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) and Standard and Poors (S&P), with a view to fulfilling the requirement of the global investment community for a reliable, standard industry classification system.
The GICS classification has a wide global reach and thus covers 42,000 companies that account for 95 percent of the global market capitalization.
The hierarchical GICS structure has four levels from sectors, industry groups, industries and sub-industries. The sector is the most general level, while the sub-industry being the most specific level. Overall there are 10 sectors, 24 industry groups, 68 industries and 154 sub-industries.How do you compare the existing classification used by the stock exchange with GICS
There are two main differences.
First, the GICS is obviously an international standard while the existing classification framework was locally developed.
Second, the GICS is structurally hierarchical with four different levels. The existing framework is a single layer system with 20 different sectors.How is a listed company classified according to the GICS
Standard & Poors and MSCI jointly assign a company to a single GICS sub-industry according to the definition of its principal business activity. Revenues are a significant factor in determining principal business activity; however, earnings analysis and market perception are also important criteria for classification in case where revenue analyses do not provide a clear direction. For this purpose, only public information is used so that anyone can replicate the assignment.
Likewise any company will be assigned to the most appropriate sub-industry, i.e. the fourth level of the GICS hierarchy. The other levels pertaining to the classification of the particular company, i.e. third, second and the first level are derived from the pre-defined GICS hierarchical tree.
Therefore, each company will have its own sub industry, industry, industry group and a sector, which would provide an immense flexibility to analysts.
The detailed version of a methodology is available in the public domain and a simple web search with the search term GICS Mapbook will help.Companies might get into new business areas in time. Will the GICS be in a position to capture these dynamics
Of course. Once a classification is assigned to a particular company it is reviewed annually, at a minimum. In addition to this, companies are under constant surveillance for corporate actions. For example, if a particular major corporate action redefines a companys primary line of business, a new appropriate reclassification is carried out.
At a minimum, annual reviews are conducted to ensure that a company has not redefined its line of business through a series of smaller events.The GICS structure is hierarchical with four levels. Are the number of sectors, industry groups, industries and sub-industries constant
No. The GICS structure is also reviewed annually based on a survey conducted publicly among the finance community. Accordingly, as the global economy changes, sectors, industry group, industries and sub-industries may be added or divided to represent more meaningful and reliable structure.Which particular advantages do you expect to have by adopting the GICS to classify listed companies on the CSE
The use of this global standard helps foreign investors compare companies outside of their local markets and the CSE attracts their attention. The GICS enables the fund managers and investment research community to make comparisons by industry. The GICS helps market participants determine whether stock performances are locally based or are part of a broader global trend. The GICS structure is such that grouping dissimilar companies together is very unlikely.
Four classification levels allow for a more varied level of analysis - for example compare a particular analyst who is interested in running the analysis in more general level as against a one who wants to do the same at more granular level. Of course the GICS is ready facilitating both. The former analyst will do the analysis at the sector level (first level of GICS hierarchy) while the latter analysing at a more bub level second, third or even fourth level of GICS hierarchy.
Likewise, we expect to make our market more appealing to investment community globally and increase the visibility of our listed companies internationally. This kind of robust, standard classification will not only help foreign investors but also to local investor community to truly diversify their investments.
However, it should be noted that since our market is a smaller market we will not be able to do the same at more granular level since the number of peers in a particular group will be very low. Hence, we have limited the implementation of the GICS at the CSE only to the first and second levels.How is the successful implementation of the GICS at the CSE ensured
We, at the Colombo Stock Exchange, strongly believe that stakeholder consultation plays a key role in a successful implementation of a project in this nature.
We have taken two measures, to sure this: 
The first measure is, in order to ensure the comfort of our stakeholders, including listed companies, institutional investors such as the unit trust management companies, broker firms and custodian banks, we engaged in face to face and mail consultations.

Second, we decided to run the GICS classification as an alternative by way of a pilot project of one year along with the current classification system. Even the pilot project, we implement gradually. We first introduced the classification started publishing in only on our website last week, then we will introduce the sub-indices and then we plan to expand the dissemination to daily printed publications, etc. After the pilot period, we will take a decision to fully migrate to the GICS or not based on another round of stakeholder consultations.
We believe this will ensure a smooth transition. Should you have any query, send an email to gics@cse.lk.

	GMOA Secretary Dr. Nalinda Herath responding to a statement by the Prime Minister that the GMOA did not make any contribution to the January 8 revolution, said that they had not contributed to set up or topple any government in the past and would not do so in the future as well.
	We do not mind any revolutions or counter-revolutions. We neither represent Rajapaksas nor the Wickremesinghes but our members. We cannot stop our trade union action going against our central committee decision. We regret the Prime Minister making such a statement. Earlier such statements were made by ministers like Mervyn Silva and S.B. Dissanayake, he said.
	Dr. Herath said President Maithripala Sirisena and Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne had given them two discussions but the Prime Minister had not given any discussion so far despite repeated pleas.
	GMOA Spokesman Dr. Navin de Soysa said they had not made any new demands from the new government but had requested not to remove the previous privileges and concessions enjoyed by them so far.
	We have not demanded any salary hike or any other privileges. We request the government to keep intact the privileges and concessions given to doctors earlier so that the professionals could get attracted to the government service and provide a better service to the people, he said.(Ajith Siriwardana)

SL to sign Convention against  Enforced Disappearances
	
	Sri Lanka has signed the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearances, the Foreign Ministry said.
	The document was signed on Thursday at the United Nations Headquarters in New York by Sri Lankas Permanent Representative to the UN, A. Rohan Perera.
	The Act in relation to the Convention, which will hold the government accountable for enforced disappearances, is being drafted and expected to be passed in parliament next month.
	Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera said enforced disappearances, even those not connected to the conflict, had plagued Sri Lanka.
	Ratifying the convention demonstrates the governments stance. It is not a matter of partisanship and we hope it is not seen as such when it is tabled in Parliament, he said and added that the Act would be of no help to the families of those who disappeared during the conflict, but would ensure that future governments would be held accountable for any such disappearances.
	This will ensure that governments wont shirk their responsibilities in such situations and will be answerable not only to Sri Lankan citizens but also to the international community, the minister said.
	Discussions are also underway with the International Committee of the Red Cross about setting up a domestic mechanism to look into disappearances which occurred prior to the convention being ratified.
	We hope to set up a permanent office in Sri Lanka to look into these matters. It was not the time to defend the past human rights record of this country but to retrieve Sri Lankas lost voice in human rights. Enabling a good record at home will allow the country to be a global voice for human rights, the minister said. (Nabeela Hussain and Lahiru Pothmulla)

Nation Lanka Finance empowers Lankan entrepreneurs to build a sustainable future
	
There is a silent but visible revolution taking place at the grassroots level in Sri Lanka. Some 75,000 women have been financially empowered and are expanding their entrepreneurship skills, whilst uplifting their lives and giving hope to their families for a brighter future. The entity behind this significant transformation is Nation Lanka Finance (NLF), a finance company licensed and regulated by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka with a rich heritage of 28 years.
The innovative finance company launched its microfinance operation as recently as 2011, with a team of four employees, which has now swelled to 275 employees, having serviced 260,000 customers across the length and breadth of the island. The team is manned by experienced microfinance professionals who have extensive experience in this realm.
Although microfinance is widely acknowledged as a vital instrument in poverty alleviation, NLF has gone one step further and customized its microfinance product to actually address the needs of every single customer, thereby ensuring that the access to finance that it provides grows the customers business in a tangible manner and has a far-reaching impact.
NLF CEO Jayantha Perera explained, The small and medium enterprises or SMEs are the backbone of the economy - and by empowering these diverse small-scale and cottage industries, our company is playing a vital role in elevating the lives of people at the grassroots level. The customers access our micro loans for setting up grocery shops, producing food items and so on, which are vital services in rural and urban settings.
Hence, NLF is proud to be driving the spirit of entrepreneurship in the country. The sheer number of loans being accessed around the country from us demonstrates that our microfinance instrument has given this segment just the boost they needed to brighten their tomorrows. Our microfinance portfolio posted an exceptional growth of 108 percent in the 2014/15 financial year, in comparison to the previous year, growing by over Rs.1 billion.
Apart from the economic benefits derived by the beneficiaries, the assistance by the company has also enhanced their social status in society, which spurs them to further grow their small businesses. By ensuring that the funds are meant for small entrepreneurs with existing businesses and not as personal loans, NLF monitors the funds to see that they are spent in a responsible manner and for purposes of enhancing the business, informed Perera. 
Our microfinance brand, Dinawamu Lanka, is ensuring greater financial inclusion and empowering the female population of Sri Lanka to enhance their presence in the countrys workforce. By strengthening them economically, NLF is also promoting gender equality while assisting these capable entrepreneurs to dream big. There are times when we help them see future possibilities for expansion and show them the path to achieve their true potential, which gives us the greatest joy, added Perera.
A female customer from Negombo commented on her association with NLF. I obtained a loan of Rs.35,000 from NLF in order to expand my dried fish business in Negombo. I have since obtained and repaid a Rs.75,000 loan and am now repaying a third loan of Rs.200,000. Today, I earn well and enjoy good profits from my business. I owe my familys and my success to NLF. The best part of dealing with NLF is the ease of obtaining loans with a minimum of paperwork, unlike other companies I have tried in the past.
NLF has built its reputation on strong connections with local communities. Geared with a presence in 25 locations throughout Sri Lanka, the company is well placed to support communities across the country.
NLF General Manager Microfinance Pradeep Balasuriya explained, We invested a significant amount of time to research and study traditional microfinance models before we devised our own unique microfinance model. Our objective was to have a structured microfinance instrument that would go beyond merely disbursing funds. We wanted to remain engaged with our customers and towards this end we also provide credit plus services such as financial management training and technical guidance, to witness first-hand the lasting impact of our intervention.
Microfinance is not only a business operation at NLF; it is our commitment for providing a sustainable future for the poorest of the poor in our country. Our strategy is built around our customers, placing them at the centre of everything we do and helping them realize their true potential.
More significantly, the microfinance team is passionate and driven by the socially responsible mandate of their job. This has necessitated recruiting individuals with a strong sense of responsibility and commitment, and training them under the theme of One Team-One Focus. This strong grounding in the vision, mission and values of the company has set them on the right path to transforming lives at the grassroots level and helped to uplift the SME sector.
A customer from Trincomalee enthused, I sought a loan of Rs.35,000 from NLF in order to expand my tailoring business in Trincomalee, which I was granted speedily. Thanks to the loan, I was able to buy a sewing machine. Under the guidance of NLF, I paid my first one-year loan of Rs.35,000 within just nine months. Then I took a second loan of Rs.45,000. Now I have moved to my own new shop building and commenced selling readymade clothes along with tailoring services. I have obtained a loan of Rs.200,000 to further upgrade my shop. I now have a good customer base and goodwill in the area. NLF helped me realize my dream.
Internal efficiencies have been further enhanced with the implementation of an integrated ERP system, which will contribute towards the improvement of oversight mechanisms and also support strategic decision-making. The companys presence in 25 locations covers close to 85 percent of the geographical extent of the country. Apart from offering greater accessibility to its services, staff members from these locations make weekly visits to customers in an effort to monitor their progress and provide support, whilst also ensuring their financial commitments are met. The company plans to expand its presence in the upcountry region, as well as in Ampara, Moneragala and in the Eastern Province in the coming calendar year.
NLF is cognizant of the fact that besides merely offering microfinance at the grassroots level, we are also ushering this segment into the mainstream and inculcating the savings habit. Many of our customers do not have bank accounts. By bringing the unbanked into the financial mainstream, we are able to grow our customers financial standing by offering financial management training and advice. We look at forging long-term bonds with each of our customers, said Balasuriya.
The company is on a strong growth trajectory and its microfinance arm, which contributes nearly 55 percent to company revenues, is showing strong potential for growth. The passion and dedication that the microfinance team exhibits goes beyond the norm. This passion is in turn reciprocated by the companys customer base, which reflects an above industry 97 percent repayment record, thereby enabling the company to record a favourable non-performing loans portfolio. Instead, the team aims to see that their operations have had a sustainable impact on every customer and enhanced their lives and livelihoods.
In all of its endeavours, NLF will remain dedicated to serving the country and its people, by continuing to offer a diversified range of practical finance products and services, in an efficient, ethical and professional manner. NLF is licensed and regulated by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka and has a rich heritage extending over 28 years. The company has built its reputation on strong connections with local communities and stakeholders.

Now, cadet training for kids
	
	School children in the Western Province from Grade 8 and above would be given cadet training from next year to improve discipline and skills among them, Western Province Chief Minister Isuru Dewapriya said yesterday.
	Commenting on a series of measures to be taken in the New Year in the Western Province to develop education, Chief Minister Dewapriya said there have been discrepancies and discriminations against Provincial Councils, when State funds were allocated by the Central Government.
	We have taken steps to fill 1,600 teacher vacancies in the Western Province by next year and a majority of them are graduates. When you compare the amount of fund allocated to 356 National Schools managed by the Central Government and nearly 10,000 schools that come under Provincial Councils, you yourself can realise the discrimination, he said.
	Mr. Dewapriya said not only the students but school Principals too would be given leadership training as the discipline in the National School system was in low ebb.
	A strict set of health regulations would be introduced to eateries, hotels, restaurants, tea shops and canteens in the Western Province as majority of them were run under highly unhygienic environment and foods served and stored were also unclean and unhealthy, he charged.
	All of them will be given six months to make their commercial establishments clean and hygienic. Not only the foods and drinks served must be clean and hygienic, the employees served there must be clean and tidy. New regulations will be introduced to make sure they follow the guidelines. Those who fail to adhere to the new set up will have to close down their establishments or face legal action, he said.
	He said a modern solid waste disposal project would be launched in Colombo with the assistance of Japan to solve perennial solid waste disposal problem in the city.
	The project envisages constructing a 10 MWs power plant using solid waste as source of energy.
	Uva UPFA Parliamentarian Lakshman Seneviratne said the new government had been able to change the negative attitude of the West and the good relations had improved Sri Lankas position among the global community. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

SLC elections: Dayasiri inquires into objections against candidates
	
	The Minister of Sports Dayasiri Jayasekera conducted an inquiry today into some of the objections made against candidates contesting the Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) elections next month.
	Among those present at the inquiry were former SLC administrator Thilanga Sumathipala and former captain and Minister of Ports and Aviation Arjuna Ranatunga.
	Speaking to the media after the inquiry, Mr. Sumathipala, who is also the deupty speaker of parliament, said, "There were objections to some of the nominations for the Sri Lanka Cricket elections and the Sports Ministry conducted an inquiry today, where he brought them forward, and allowed us to respond, with considerations about the Sports Law and Sri Lanka Cricket constitution. The results of the inquiry along with the Ministers final decision could be made public tomorrow."
	Meanwhile, Ranatunga said that some of the objections raised against him were a personal attack and that he hoped to bring SLC administration in line with the policies of good governance.
	There was an allegation against me saying that I had thrown away some matches while I was playing, but those have been disproved in the past. This is a personal attack against me. There was no proof to back the objections that were made and I have no issues with this inquiry, Ranatunga said.

Water supply to Colombo may be disrupted today
	
	The Engineering Diplomates' Association and Technical Officers' Union of the National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB) said yesterday that there might be some disruption of the water supply to Colombo District as a result of a work-to-rule campaign conducted by them in Colombo today.
	Engineering Diplomates' Association president Ashoka de Alwis said all the Engineering Assistants of the NWSDB would participate in the campaign and refrain from carrying out overtime services, night time break down services and weekend/off day services from today -- and that that might result in a disruption of the water supply.
	Mr. Alwis said they had requested the authorities to resolve their issues, including recruitments and various salary anomalies of the engineering assistants, but that they had ignored them.
	He said they would extend their trade union action to the rest of the country if their issues were not resolved and that there might be delay in attending to breakdown services. They said the general manager of the Water Board should take the responsibility for that.(Ajith Siriwardane)
