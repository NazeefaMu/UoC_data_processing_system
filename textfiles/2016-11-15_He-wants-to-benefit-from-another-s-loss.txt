He wants to benefit from another’s loss


	



 

This young PC member, the son of a former purohita who has been long nursing the ambition to enter the Diyawanna council   has now set his heart upon an easy way of achieving his aim. 

 


There is a Diyawanna member from his district now facing a murder charge in courts and this provincial politico is eagerly waiting for the day the latter gets a life term so that he would be able to move into the Diyawanna seat due to fall vacant. “I am sure the man will be convicted which means my way to Diyawanna is a sure thing. Mark my words. I won’t be just a plain member. I am going to get at least deputy status,” he would often brag to his associates, they say. 

“Suppose, if your best bet fails – I mean if the case ended in an acquittal, what would be your position?” one of his friends had asked. 


“In that case, I’ll throw in my lot with our former boss!” was his prompt reply, they say.
