Deputy Minister of Public Administration and Management Susantha Punchinilame said today he sought permission from President Maithripala Sirisena to leave the Government and sit in the Opposition.

Mr. Punchinilame told the Daily Mirror he briefed the President about his position.

However, he said the President asked him to stay for one month.

“I have to act according to the interests of my constituents,” he said.

Asked whether he would sit in the Opposition whatever decision the United People’s Freedom Alliance (UPFA) took as a party, he replied, “Let’s see it at that moment!”

Mr. Punchinilame was elected to Parliament from the Trincomalee District at the 2015 Parliamentary Elections. (Kelum Bandara)
