Assault on past student; Police to obtain TV footage


	

Galle Chief Magistrate Nilupuli Lankapura yesterday granted permission to the Police to obtain TV video footage of a Southland Vidyalaya's former student who was assaulted while filming the protest by past students and parents yesterday at the Galle bus stand.

Permission was granted on the basis of a report alleging abuse threats and criminal harassment committed against a woman.

Some 200 past students and parents called for the cancellation of the transfer of the Principal of the Southland Vidyalaya in Galle.

The 20-year-old woman was videoing the protest when some protesters asked her to stop the videoing. But she had continued the videoing claiming nobody can stop her from doing so. She was then assaulted until police arrived on the scene and removed the attackers.

A woman has been taken into custody in this connection. Investigations are continuing under the instructions of Galle SSP Salaiya Silva and ASP Sathis Gamage. (D.G. Sugathapala)
