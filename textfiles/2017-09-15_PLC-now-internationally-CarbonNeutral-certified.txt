People’s Leasing & Finance PLC (PLC), Sri Lanka’s market leader in leasing and a subsidiary of People’s Bank, was recently awarded the internationally accredited CarbonNeutral certification by Natural Capital Partners (NCP) of the UK. 


PLC’s commitment to not only measure but to extend its efforts to lower the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of its organisational operations and subsequently neutralise its overall impact was essential in it reaching this critical milestone in the company’s ongoing sustainability journey.


No stranger to carbon footprinting and offsetting, PLC has been a carbon neutral business entity for the past two years. However, having realised the need to step up its efforts to meet global standards, it recently contracted the country’s leading sustainability consultancy firm, The Carbon Consulting Company (CCC), to conduct a more in-depth assessment of its organisational carbon footprint that took into account applicable yet previously unconsidered emissions sources of their head office, branches, service centres and subsidiaries. Following the assessment, its results were independently verified by the Sustainable Future Group (SFG) – NCP UK’s regional partner providing verification, validation and assurance services. Once verified, the SFG facilitated the investment in a renewable energy project in Sri Lanka, in return for which PLC was provided with a matching number of Carbon Credits to offset its carbon footprint. 


Apart from the environmental benefits, this project has also contributed to the local economy and livelihood of residents through the creation of additional jobs and PLC is further bridging the gap between the local businesses and community projects to create a more sustainable future. As a result of this exhaustive audit, PLC was able to align itself to international standards for achieving carbon neutrality and was subsequently awarded CarbonNeutral Certification by the SFG on behalf of NCP UK.


CCC CEO Sanith de S. Wijeyeratne added, “We’re pleased that PLC wants to align itself with the globally recognised CarbonNeutral community. This is a huge step in showing others in their industry that the CarbonNeutral status can be achieved through strategic partnerships within the community. Sri Lanka as a country is realising the importance of governments and industries becoming aware of climate change and what can be done to mitigate its effects on people and the planet. PLC is just one step closer to aiding the change of the future of sustainability.”


PLC CEO/GM Sabry Ibrahim stated, “This internationally recognised certification for carbon neutrality is a testament to how we wish to position PLC as a responsible finance company in Sri Lanka. I would like to thank the Carbon Consulting Company for helping us through this process and we will continue the efforts that have now launched us on to an international platform in terms of protecting the planet.”
