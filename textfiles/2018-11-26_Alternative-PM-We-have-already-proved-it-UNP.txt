Alternative PM; We have already proved it: UNP


	

Responding to the statement that have been made by President Maithripala Sirisena that he is willing to appoint an alternative Prime Minister if a member of Parliament proves he has a majority, the UNP yesterday said it cannot think of a new way to show a majority as they have already proved it.

This sentiment was expressed by UNP MP Ajith P Perera at a media briefing last afternoon.

“We have shown that we have a majority by approving two no-confidence motions against the new government while we did proved that present Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksha does not have a majority by approving the committee of selection appointed by the Speaker. One hundred and twenty one members voted for it,” Mr. Perera said.

Asked whether UNP Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe has a majority in the House, he said Mr Wickremesinghe does have a majority in the House. “Few who had become ministers in the new government will also come out and support Mr Wickremesinghe at the right time,” he said.

Asked why UNP has not submitted affidavits and prove that Mr. Wickremesinghe has a majority, Mr. Perera said they are willing to do it immediately if President gives an opportunity to do it after meeting him.(Yohan Perera)
