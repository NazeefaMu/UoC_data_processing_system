France, (Daily Mail, London), 20 April 2017 -
More than half of police officers in France have said they are voting for far-right candidate Marine Le Pen in Sunday’s election because of her strong anti-terror stance.


According to the IFOP poll, 51 per cent of the Gendarmerie are planning to back Le Pen in the nail-biting election.


That is more than double the number of people who are backing her nearest rival, centrist Emmanuel Macron (16.5 per cent).Le Pen has pledged to beef up law and  order in her manifesto, with 15,000 more police officers, deporting  foreign criminals and closing extremist mosques.


According to the poll, Le Pen’s strongest base of support is among working-age people with lower education. Le Pen told supporters in Paris: ‘I will protect you. My first measure as president will be to reinstate France’s borders.


‘The choice on Sunday is simple. It is a choice between a France that is rising again and a France that is sinking.
