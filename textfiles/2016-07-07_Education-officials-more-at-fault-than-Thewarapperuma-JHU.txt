Education officials more at fault than Thewarapperuma: JHU


	

Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) said today Deputy Minister PalithaThewarapperuma only mediated to mete out justice to the parents and children who were deprived of their right to education though his behaviour was unacceptable.

JHU central committee member Ven. Hadigalle Wimalasara Thera said what was even more serious was the fact that education authorities had ignored the plight ofthe nine students who were without a school for six months.

“As a responsible political party, we do not approve of Deputy Minister Thewarapperuma’s violent behaviour but he did so to mete out justice to the parents and the children who were deprived of their right to education. It is the education authorities who must be faulted not so much the deputy minister,” he said.

The Thera said it was regrettable that the parents were remanded for no other reason but because of desperate attempt to get a school for their children.

“They entered the school premises not to loot but to win a basic right for their children. It is a matter that has to be looked into in a more humane manner than in legal terms. They may have resorted to violence because justice was not meted out to them,” he said.(Ajith Siriwardana)
