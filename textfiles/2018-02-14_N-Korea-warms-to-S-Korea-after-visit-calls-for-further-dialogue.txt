N. Korea warms to S.Korea after visit, calls for further dialogue


	



 

North Korea’s leader said he wants to boost the “warm climate of reconciliation and dialogue” with South Korea after his high-level delegation returned from a visit to the South.   


 Kim Jong Un gave his gratitude to Seoul for their “sincere efforts” to prioritise the delegation’s visit, which were “very impressive”, KCNA said.   


 Kim Jong Un gave instructions for measures aimed at more inter-Korean engagement after his younger sister Kim Yo Jong led a three-day visit to the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics, North Korea’s state media reported on Tuesday. 

 
 It did not specify what those instructions were.   
 The United States has appeared to endorse deeper post-Olympics engagement between the two Koreas that could lead to talks between Pyongyang and Washington. South’s President Moon Jae-in said on Tuesday the United States is open to talking with North Korea, Moon’s spokesman told a briefing.   


 “The United States sees inter-Korean dialogue in a positive light and has expressed its openness for talks with the North,” Moon told Latvian President Raimonds Vjonis, according to the spokesman.   
 U.S. officials also want tough international sanctions to be ramped up to push North Korea to give up its nuclear programme.   


 Last year, North Korea conducted dozens of missile launches and its sixth and largest nuclear test in defiance of U.N. resolutions as it pursues its goal of developing a nuclear-armed missile capable of reaching the United States.
