Janashakthi- National Civilian Bravery Awards 2017

When we were small, our minds were conditioned in such a way that as soon as the word ‘hero’ is mentioned, elegant figures wearing capes and fancy clothes swooping out of the sky and saving the day come to our minds. But what most of us don’t realize is that heroes who don’t wear capes, who are set apart from the rest of the humanity only by their selflessness and bravery, walk among us even now. While millions of people go through the everyday motions of their lives, that handful of people make heroic sacrifices to ensure the well-being of others disregarding their own, sometimes putting their own lives at risk in the process.   

Fifteenth of June saw a group of such people, from all over the country, assemble into Nelum Pokuna Theatre for the Civilian Bravery awards 2017. Awards were given under three categories; National Civilian Bravery Awards, Civilian Bravery Philanthropy Awards and Civillian Bravery Fauna/Flora Awards.

Eranga cared little about his life 

All animals including humans are programmed in a way that they usually value their lives beyond everything else. Whenever their lives are threatened, they rely on instinct and do all they can to save themselves. Eranga Wikumsiri, an Economic Development Officer of the Aranayake Samasara Division, was attending a meeting held in his division when he heard about the landslide of the Samasara Kanda. He along with his brother went against their ingrained instinct for survival. They braved the mouth of the devil and went from house to house in the risk area, notifying the residents of the impending doom. The brothers were tirelessly helping people evacuate the area when the second landslide struck. Eranga along with his brother was swallowed up by the torrent of earth. Even though Eranga will never reunite with his wife and his little son, more than sixty families continue to see the light of day thanks to his courageous actions. Eranga’s post-humus Gold Civilian Bravery Award, for the incredible feat of saving lives of the others at the cost of his own life, was received by his wife at the ceremony.   

An Aircraftsman’s diving feat 

Naveen Dhanushka Bandara, a young aircraftman at the Air Force Base in Batticaloa, was walking to town when he saw a crowd gathered around an area of the Batticaloa lagoon. On making inquiries, he learned that a three-wheeler with four passengers had been driven onto the lagoon and was underwater. Not a single person in the crowd wanted to brave the water, which was notorious for being infested with crocodiles. The warrior who made the sky his battle ground, bravely waded into unfamiliar waters. He ignored the grave danger to his own life in diving into the murky lagoon-hiding deadly creatures in it’s depth-in search of the lives of four unknown people. The muddy water clouded his vision, leaving him grasping in the deep waters. He was able to grab hold of a child during his first attempt. He dived again and again, each time carrying another life to safety. He saved a woman and another child. On his third attempt, responding to shouts from the crowd that there was another one left, he dived back immediately, even though he was beyond exhaustion. He recalls the tightening sensation in his lungs while he was diving and the feeling of impending death with each stroke of his limbs. He grabbed the last victim by the hair and swam ashore with the last bit of energy he possessed. Only then did Naveen realize that the lady was pregnant and that he had saved two lives instead of one!
His heroic feats didn’t end there. He confesses that most of the crowd was only interested in videotaping and photographing the event, not in offering help. This sums up the ugly side of today’s society in one sentence. Therefore, Navin, dripping with water and clad only in a pair of briefs, accompanied the victims to the nearby hospital in a vehicle. He left the hospital wearing a towel that the staff gave him after admitting the patients

The witty security officer

Saman Rohitha Jayasinghe, who worked as a security officer in a bank in Katukurunda had just had his lunch when he noted two people wearing helmets and jackets in the parking lot. Even though it’s not unusual for people to enter the bank wearing jackets, he instinctively knew that something wasn’t right. So he returned to his post just in time to see one of them taking out a T56 and fire at him. Saman, dodging the bullets, rang the alarm and fired back at them with his rifle. The would be thieves whose plans of instant richness, with other people’s hard earned money, were ruined by the quick thinking of Saman. The thieves fled on their bike. Saman, whose instincts were honed by his years of working at the Air Force, was able to identify another suspicious person lurking inside the bank at the time of this incident. This person on questioning admitted that he was an accomplice of the thieves. Saman saved the reputation of his work place, preventing the bank from incurring a huge monetary loss. He was concerned about the impending risk to the life of his fellow workers and the customers inside of the bank. He helped avoid a massive disaster using his quick wit and by exploding into action.
   
Ten heroes including Naveen and Saman received Civillian Bravery Silver awards at the function for their bravery and dedication shown while going above and beyond the boundaries of duty to safeguard the lives of the others.   

Kapurubanda gave all he had 

The landslide in Aranayake Samasara Kanda was a tragedy that melted the hearts of many Sri Lankans. E.M.Kapurubanda was one such person, but rather confining his sympathy to words, he wanted to contribute in any way he could to those whose lives that were upturned due to the tragedy. He decided to donate his land consisting of three acres so that houses could be built for the people who lost their homes. Now 15 new homes are built on the land that used to be his. At a time when the family members go against each other for a few perches of land, the generous act of Kapurubanda won him the Civillian Philanthropy award.   

Rewarded five and a half decades later 

This year, in addition to the Budal Na Golden Award, a special bravery appreciation medal, a concept by Hon. Karu Jayasooriya, was awarded to Wijenamage Magilin Nona. It was the year 1961 and a group of children, in which she was a member, were crossing the cross over above the Diyagama Ela. Suddenly the log split part, causing the children on it to fall in to the rowdy waters below. Magilin Nona, a young lass at the time, even after being seriously injured on one foot during the incident, managed to save seven lives, three were her own younger siblings. Her brave actions were commemorated with deafening applause when she took to the stage to receive the award, five and a half decades after the event.   


Awards were given under three categories; National Civilian Bravery Awards, Civilian Bravery Philanthropy Awards and Civillian Bravery Fauna/Flora Awards
