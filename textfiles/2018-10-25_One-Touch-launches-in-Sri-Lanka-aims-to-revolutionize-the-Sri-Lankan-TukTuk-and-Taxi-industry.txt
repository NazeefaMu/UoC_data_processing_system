One Touch launches in Sri Lanka, aims to revolutionize the Sri Lankan TukTuk and Taxi industry


	



1 Touch Lanka (PVT) Ltd is proud to announce the launch of a revolutionary Taxi and TukTuk application in Sri Lanka. The One Touch app aims to provide its drivers a highly beneficial partnership that is unparallel to any other Taxi and TukTuk service existing in the country while also delivering an experience that is both smooth and fair to passengers.

“I’m delighted to be bringing our brand to Sri Lanka, and to be able to offer something considerably different to current offerings. - Group Chairman Allan Sharp said:

We are a socially responsible company, and believe all who work with us, or whom use services we provide are stakeholders. We have a responsibility to be fair, and to give something back to all involved. We, wherever possible, work with suppliers who understand this ethos and understand the benefits of this way of thinking. I look forward to our company making a positive contribution to Sri Lankan life” 1 Touch Lanka plans to work closely with a respected Union to provide TukTuk drivers with benefits such as Life and Accident Insurance and will contribute a portion of their profits to a benevolent fund, which drivers can call on in times of need. In addition, this fund will be used to provide training opportunities, enabling self- improvement for drivers.

Taxi Drivers will be offered improved allocations, and more opportunities for occupied return journeys from the Airport and cities other than Colombo.



“As a native of Colombo, I’m proud to be bringing a product to the market that I genuinely believe will improve the lives of Sri Lankans. - Country Head and CEO Thilan Kannangara stated.

For too long drivers have had to put up with downward pressures on their income, and as a result, customer service suffers, as drivers justifiably don’t want to collect passengers for short journeys. This is compounded by commissions and conditions that lead to a large proportion of driver wages being lost. In turn this means passengers suffer long waits, and deal with a fare structure that can result in the fare for the same journey at the same time varying by over 200%.”

By offering commission free services to drivers and offering passengers a stable fare structure, 1 Touch Sri Lanka aims to provide both parties with solutions that are equal to and at times surpassing what is already in place, while honouring their social responsibility commitments. This in turn will result in passengers preferring the One Touch app as their preferred method of transport.
