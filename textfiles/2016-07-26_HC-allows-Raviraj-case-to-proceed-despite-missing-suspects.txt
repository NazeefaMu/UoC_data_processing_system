The Colombo High Court today allowed the prosecution of the Nadarajah Raviraj assassination to proceed with evidence despite the absence of three missing suspects under the section 241 of the Criminal Procedure Code.

The case is to be taken up on September 2. Six suspects were indicted by the Attorney General under the Prevention of Terrorism Act.

The three suspects, Palana Sami Suresh, Febian Tusen and Sivakanandan alias Charan are missing.

The other suspects in remand custody are Prasad Chandana Kumara, Gamini Seneviratne and Pradeep Chaminda.

Judge Manilal Waidyathilake also directed the suspects to inform court whether they need a jury for the trial. (Shehan Chamika Silva)
