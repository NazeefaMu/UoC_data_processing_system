Despite protests, the government will be signing the long awaited trade agreement with India entitled the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) in May, 2016, Opposition MP and Pivithuru Hela Urumaya General Secretary Udaya Gammanpila alleged today.
He said Minister for Development Strategies and International Trade, Malik Samarawickrama had said the CEPA would be finalised next May while addressing a Young Entrepreneurs’ Conference held at Waters Edge Hotel recently.
Commenting on the agreement, MP Gammanpila said it will be beneficial only for Indians who would be entering into Sri Lankan trade. Indian businessmen will get an opportunity to buy our markets, he said.
“It is clear that everything has been arranged to finalise the CEPA though the government previously rejected reports that they would not be signing the agreement with India. We urge the President not to make Sri Lanka another Fiji where Indians had made up a majority in population. If the CEPA is signed, Sri Lanka will definitely become an Indian colony. We request the Yahapalana government not to let it happen,” Mr. Gammanpila said. (Piyumi Fonseka)
