Sarvodaya Development Finance bagged the compliance award in the finance companies and leasing companies sector at the 52nd annual report awards 2016 which was organized by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka. 
Speaking of the much coveted honour, Channa de Silva, Chairman of Sarvodaya Development Finance said, “We are extremely thrilled to be the recipients of this prestigious award for the second consecutive year, the judging process involves several Chartered Accountants thoroughly studying the annual reports and evaluating based on the standard of communicating business objectives, highlights, performance milestones, personnel and management comprehensively to the target audience.  As a rapidly growing organization in the micro finance and SME sector, this award encourages us to continue being a catalyst in creating an economically progressive society, living in dignity and fostering development by fulfilling expectations of all stakeholders which is the primary objective of Sarvodaya Development Finance.”
The Sarvodaya Development Finance Limited evolved from deep rooted commitment to nation building and development along the ‘grass roots’ model of its parent, the Sarvodaya Movement. The company has evolved over the past years and diversified its services primarily to empower the mass community and enrich their lives further. 
Commencing its services as a micro finance company providing finances to the micro sector Sarvodaya Development Finance has now ventured into the SME finance, vehicle leasing and personal loans services in order to cater to a larger target market with diverse needs. 
This business diversification has enabled the organization to support their existing customers who have evolved into SMEs and also new businesses that are deprived of growth due to the lack of a financial support system. 
Sarvodaya Development Finance is the pioneer in microfinance in Sri Lanka.
