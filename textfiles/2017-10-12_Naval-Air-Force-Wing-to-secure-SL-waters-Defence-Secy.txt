Defence Secretary Kapila Waidyaratne said the present threats and the geo-strategic importance of Sri Lanka has warranted the establishment of a Naval Air Force Wing to secure our waters with greater surveillance and striking capabilities.

Mr. Waidyaratne who delivered the key note address at the Colombo Air Symposium said today, Sri Lankan armed forces have been supplied with a number of naval crafts with high facilities.”It is also under the same rationale that a Joint Naval Command with the Air Force has been recommended along with a Joint Communications Network that would seek to build air and maritime capabilities, the secretary said.

He said such a network would work hand in hand with the Air Force’s Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance systems that will be modernized to better improve maritime domain awareness.”This would also lead to a better centralised command, control and intelligence structure to develop enhanced situational awareness.,” Mr. Waidyaratne said.

He said air assets remained a prime choice when responding to security threats, due to its inherent advantages of height, speed and reach. “It has become the number one choice to call upon by many governments. As seen during our conflict and natural disasters, the first response were from our air assets. It is under this rationale that we wish to develop our air capabilities both in traditional and non-traditional spheres,’ the secretary further added.
