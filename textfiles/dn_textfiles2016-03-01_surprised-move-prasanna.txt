Surprised by the move: Prasanna

 
Gampaha district MP Prasanna Ranatunga said he had come to know about his removal as the SLFP organiser for Minuwangoda electorate through the media.
Ranatunga said he was surprised by the move and added that he would comment about it soon after consulting his supporters.
However, the politician who has replaced Ranatunga as the Minuwangoda SLFP organiser is his younger brother Ruwan.
