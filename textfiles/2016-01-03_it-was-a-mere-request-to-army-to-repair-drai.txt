It was a mere request to Army to repair drains: Wigneswaran


	

Allaying misgivings about a request he had made to the army, Northern Province Chief Minister C.V.Wigneswaran said, he had merely requested the army to look into the possibility of repairing the drainage system in Jaffna, as it was the army that had filled the drains with earth during the war to prevent the LTTE from planting claymore mines in them.
He regretted that some people had twisted his request. (Romesh Madushanka)
