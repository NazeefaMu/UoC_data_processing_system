A 6.4-magnitude earthquake struck southern Taiwan early Saturday, toppling a complex of two high-rise residential buildings where rescuers pulled out more than 230 people. More are still believed to be trapped inside.

At least five people have died including a ten-day-old baby after the earthquake hit Taiwan in the early hours of this morning.

Emergency crews are working to free hundreds more people who are feared trapped after the quake struck the southern city of Tainan at around 4am at the start of the Chinese New Year holidays, according to Taiwan's state news agency.

A ten-day-old girl was reported to have died in the disaster alongside a 50-year-old man who was found in the same apartment. Another man, 40, was reportedly killed, as was a 55-year-old woman, according to an emergency response center in Tainan. (Daily Mail – UK)
