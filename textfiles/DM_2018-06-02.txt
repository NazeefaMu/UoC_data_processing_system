Beware of Leptospirosis: Epidemiologist
	
Health Education and Promotion Director, Epidemiologist Paba Palihawadana yesterday warned the public living in flood-affected areas to be vigilant of Leptospirosis that could possibly spread after floods recede.
She instructed the people to receive doxycyline-- leptospirosis disease preventing treatment from the nearest Medical Officer of Health (MOH) office or the Public Health Inspector (PHI) free of charge before engaging in farming activities or where water exists.
Dr. Palihawadana advised the public to avoid getting into water or mud, especially if they had exposed wounds or bruises in the soles or legs.
She also said medical treatment should be sought at Government Hospitals if one has any signs or symptoms of the disease such as a headache, fever, muscle pain, colour change etc.
Free medical advice or details of leptospirosis disease can be obtained free of charge via Suwasariya hot-line 0710 107 107. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

China develops deadly Silent Hunter lasers
	

China, (Daily Mail) 1 June 2018 - Chinas drone-killing lasers have successfully destroyed an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) from 1,000 feet (300 metres) away.
The feat was demonstrated at a recent arms conference in Kazakhstan and comes amid growing tensions with the US. 
Sources say the portable laser weapon can intercept low-altitude drones and could also gun down moving targets and naval vessels.
However, details about exactly how it works have yet to be revealed. The technology arm of Chinas largest state-owned arms dealer, China Poly Group, tested the gun at last weeks International Exhibition of Weapons Systems and Military Equipment in Astana, Kazakhstan. According to developers, drones with large payloads are becoming easier to obtain and could be used to launch terror attacks, writes Asia Times.
For this reason they say police forces around the world would be increasingly in need of tools like this gun to counter them.

Dr. S.Y.L.S Wickramasinghe In memory of a loving father
	
When my mother asked me to write a few words to commemorate my fathers first year death anniversary, a realisation came upon me that writing such a piece would make my heart heavy.
I have thoughts of him carrying me (his little girl) to kindergarten while I clung tightly to him in the morning. I thought of him when I saw the other day a father opening the car door for his beloved daughter, umbrella in hand to protect her while he stood half drenched in the pouring rain. I also remembered him when a father disciplined his little at one of the tables next to me while I was out having a meal. These fathers like my very own teach their children to be better persons. What made writing this article somewhat easy for me was knowing that my late father was a remarkable human being. 
My father was the late Dr. S.Y.L.S. Wickramasinghe, fondly referred to by his friends and colleagues as Leslie or Sherington. He was born in 1943. His father was Pudius Wickramasinghe, a station master, whose wife was Nancy. He was the eighth child in a long list of ten children. One could say that he was born to a family determined to succeed against all odds.

Tough times in life influenced my father to become a doctor. It was certainly the experiences he encountered as a child that made him understand the pain suffered by human beings
Tough times in life influenced my father to become a doctor. It was certainly the experiences he encountered as a child that made him understand the pain suffered by human beings. In pursuing his dream, my father obtained his MBBS in Sri Lanka and his double FRCS in England and Edinburgh. During the early 1970s on wards, Sri Lanka experienced an influx of brain drain, when many young professionals emigrated. My father was one of the few who returned after his studies. Reflecting on the choice he made, I am not surprised because that was the kind of man he was. He was the kind of person who would run into a burning building to help out when everyone else ran out.
Like all Government doctors father was posted in outstation areas like Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa and Kurunegala. But father seemed to like this simplistic life and took pleasure in serving the underprivileged. He took his work on the stride.
He was a history buff and read and reread all he could on Sri Lankan history pertaining to these places. He was patriotic to the core and took his duties and responsibilities as a doctor very seriously. I remember my father coming home to see us for the weekend, once every two weeks, and we kids sadly waving goodbye to him while he boarded a packed train back to his place of work. 
We even shared an inside joke about one of us asking him Thaththa how was your day as we had lunch, to which he would replied not bad, I only had to tell off one person so far.
Being the sole breadwinner, my father planned ahead and took great pride in supporting his family while our mother stayed at home to take care of us. We never went without a party for all our birthdays. Once when I refused to face an examination, father encouraged me to do so in his toughlove approach. I remember returning home sulkily after facing the exam to find a cake of my favourite colour on the dining table. Father was the human directory at home since he remembered the telephone numbers of everyone we crossed paths with. 
During tough times I miss his sharp wit and sense of humour more than ever. When he was around happiness was only a phone call away. 
If I had to mention a flaw in my father that would be that he had a nave assumption that people would reciprocate the loyalty and gratitude that he showed them. The last time he was to be hospitalised I called him to find out how he was doing. This was when he was being taken there by ambulance. His reply was, Im okay darling dont worry. Those were the last words my father said to me.
As a Buddhist my only wish is that you be my father in my next birth in this journey of Samsara, till you attain the bliss of Nirvana.

EILEEN MARY SIBELLE DE SILVA (nee DISSANAYAKE)  She was a woman of great value
	
Eileen Dissanayake was my English Literature teacher and later my class teacher in the HSC1 class at Holy Family Convent, Bambalapitiya.
She was born on September 29, 1922. Eileen had her primary and secondary education at Holy Family Convent. She had a brilliant academic record. She won the Senior Cambridge Scholarship Exam, coming first in the island and was the Head Girl at Holy Family Convent, Bambalapitiya from 1938 - 1941. Eileen was a member of the editorial team that produced the school magazine Refreshing Breezes.

Eileen also loved music, drama and singing. She was a proud member of a unique Sri Lankan choir which sang at many venues in Sydney including at the Sydney Opera House

During an era when women werent encouraged to study beyond Year 10, one would imagine there was very little support or assistance for women to enter University. Eileen had to compete against students from prestigious boys schools that had more resources and also some of the best teachers. But this didnt deter Eileen. She was determined and focussed. Eileen was the first woman in her family to have a university education and so started her life-long passion for learning, education and teaching. After graduating from the University of Colombo with a BA (English Hons), she joined her beloved Alma Mater as a teacher.
We were indeed privileged to have her as our teacher at that time. Apart from being our teacher, Eileen was also a friend and confidante and I remember the great times we all had at school. 
In 1955, Eileen left the staff of the school after marrying Aloysius de Silva (Aloy), a lawyer from Kurunegala. She lived in Kurunegala with Aloy and raised three daughters: Marie-lyse, Diane & Sandra.
Eileen later returned to teaching, this time at Holy Family Kurunegala until she retired at the age of 60! Eileen qualified as a Speech & Drama teacher obtaining a Licentiate and Fellow of the Trinity College of London. Later she set up her own business as a teacher of Speech & Drama in Kurunegala. Eileen moved to Australia in 1998 and quickly adapted to the Australian lifestyle.
Eileen loved writing, specially poetry. In 2002, Eileen published a collection of poems called Ripples on a Lake. These poems showed how she loved lifes experiences.
Eileen also loved music, drama and singing. She was a proud member of a unique Sri Lankan choir which sang at many venues in Sydney including at the Sydney Opera House.
Eileen was a teacher who instilled in us a thirst for knowledge and deep passion for learning.
Eileen touched many hearts and minds. I will always remember Eileen with great fondness and as an exceptional teacher and a dear friend; as a woman of great value.She passed away on April 6, 2018.
May she Rest in Peace.

EU moves ahead with counterstrike to American tariffs
	

By Quentin Aris, James McAuley (c) 2018, The Washington Post  Jun 01, 2018 - BRUSSELS - The European Union moved ahead Friday with a slew of retaliatory countermeasures in response to the Trump administrations steel and aluminum import tariffs.
A day after the United States announced the tariffs would not exempt the E.U., Canada or Mexico, the Brussels-based bloc announced that it would file a complaint with the World Trade Organization. And before the end of June, the E.U. will also impose tariffs targeting certain American imports.
Cecilia Malmstrom, the E.U.s trade chief, lamented the failure of last-minute negotiations with her American counterparts but insisted that Europes response would be firm. We have been very clear about the consequences, she said.
After President Donald Trump first announced the tariffs in March, the E.U. threatened retaliatory actions. In mid-May, the bloc published a 10-page list of American products facing potential E.U. tariffs, many of them with symbolic meaning, including bourbon, a mainstay of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnells home state of Kentucky, and cranberries, which are grown in House Speaker Paul D. Ryans native Wisconsin.
Malmstrom said that specific retaliatory measures would be submitted to the World Trade Organization by June 20.
The European Union measures will be reasonable, proportionate and in full compliance with WTO rules and obligations, Frederic Mogherini, the E.U.s foreign policy chief, told reporters Friday morning.

FTAs and Malik: Reminiscing on Tea and Rugby with Shawallians
	
 Shaw Wallace & Hedges Ltd [now defunct] the more than 100-year old multinational company was mainly engaged in the tea industry and trading. The writer joined this conglomerate in the late 1960s to work at their plush Kollupitiya head office where more than half the top men were Brits who were on a phased programme of desertion to their homeland disgruntled over adverse effects of the 56 transformation that followed Independencein 1948. 
On March 30, the Daily Mirror reported that, Sri Lanka and Singapore signed a Free Trade Agreement [FTA] on January 23, 2018. It said, This is a comprehensive free trade agreement which covers goods, services, e-commerce, telecommunications, foreign direct investment, intellectual property and public procurement. Minister Malik Samarawickrema, who is handling the matter denied the allegation that the Agreement was designed secretly without the knowledge of the Cabinet and that it was detrimental to our industry. 
A spokesman for the anti-FTA movement said the Professionals National Front have filed FR cases in this regard. They were highly critical of the role of businessman Minister Malik played. It is not the intention of this article to discuss complicating intricacies or clarify the legal doctrines of FTAs or to analyse its pros and cons, which are beyond the ambit of this piece; but, to share some nostalgic memories of rugby and tea with Europeans and the controversial Ministers talents as a young ruggerite in the good old days. 

Tea and Rugby in Ceylon harks back to the glorious days of one and a half centuries ago. Shattock never used the short term Rugby but always called the game Rugby Football

Wine and Dine over Tea and Rugby
Wine and dine over Tea and Rugby was the European planters motto since they introduced the Camellia sinensis plant and the elongated ellipsoidal ball in Colonial Ceylon in the glorious days of late 19th century since James Taylor, a Scotsman, planted it on Loolecondera Estate in 1867. The first rugger match between planters clubs, Dimbulla vs Dickoya was played at Radella in 1880. They dominated both the industry and the game up to mid 20th century, by which time they decided to bid good-bye to the former colony. Also, at the time I joined Shaw Wallace & Hedges the privileges that we enjoyed included; free mid-day meal, spacious club house within the five-acre premises with billiards and liquor bar, well equipped holiday bungalows in Kadugannawa, Nuwara-Eliya and Bentota, a fully paid two-week family holiday for each employee once a year travelling exclusively first class to and from holiday destination by train, free health services with an in-house medical officer and dispensary, free medicine, payment of hospital bills and study allowances were just a part of the long list. Absorption of children into the staff at the retirement of the father who will enjoy a life-time monthly pension was another genuine motivating factor that helped in developing a loyal and dedicated team. 
The European and local directors and estate superintendents, who enjoyed a five-month furlough every four years continued to wear the planters dress of white shorts and stockings to office too. They, along with senior local executives would assemble in the elegant lounge in mid-afternoon for a chitchat discussing contemporary tea tasting and auctions over a beer until lunch was served. On Mondays, the hullabaloo changes, as the noise increases in multiple decibels [no sound proofing as air-conditioning was unheard of then] exchange of verbal clashes for and against the results of weekend rugger matches by supporters of the respective sides who in their youth and planting days represented their old clubs of Dimbulla, Dickoya, Uva, Kelani Valley-Ratnapura, Kandy and Kalutara that clashed over the weekend. 
On Fridays, by 3.45 p.m. work stops all round -- the directorate and senior management leaves for the rugger match played in Colombo after granting permission to any rugger fan in the staff to follow suit. Every year one or two good school ruggrites will be given employment so as to maintain the high standard of the companys Rugby. 

Maliks move Won us Rugby Cup in 1970s
Development Strategies and International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrama, who spoke judiciously in Parliament on May 22, responding to criticism, and arguments by opposition against the Free Trade Agreement with Singapore, was the daring scrum-half in our side who collected the ball from the base and equally judiciously kicked towards the post for winger Cuda Wadugodapitiya, former Trinity and CH & FC player to touch down under the posts during extra time registering the 3rd Mercantile title for the Company against John Keels in the mid-1970s. The writer was the games secretary at Shaw Wallace Sports Club who witnessed that memorable Mercantile 7s Rugby Finals played at Longdon Place four decades ago. Samarawickrama was a selfless man whos charm and winning ways are exemplary [at Rugby]. Malik the Royal College scrum half who played for CR & FC later went on to represent the National Rugby team in the 1970s. At the CR, Indrajit Coomaraswamy, the present Governor of the Central Bank who is a professional, intellectual, and a gentleman at the highest order was Maliks team mate. 
Scrum-half is usually a smaller player on the field but he needs to be physically and mentally tough, constantly taking on larger, stronger, heavier players in attack and defence and would posses excellent handling, passing skills and good vision in addition to agility; they are razor sharp, capable of sizing things up with elusiveness and good decision-making ability. Scrum-half will make and confirm the decision what to do with the ball perhaps by coded signals that he will make a tactical kick. 
A good scrum half will work hard to confuse the opposition with sniping runs and the unexpected kicks and passes -- characteristics of a good scrum half and an astute politician 

On Fridays, by 3.45 p.m. work stops all round -- the directorate and senior management leaves for the rugger match played in Colombo after granting permission to any rugger fan in the staff to follow suit. Every year one or two good school ruggrites will be given employment for maintaining the high standard of the companys Rugby.

Shaw Wallace Sports Club in 1970s
Back to Shaw Wallace days -- one would appreciate the elegantly framed photographs of former European Chairmen/MD that added glamour to the walls of the grand club house, most of them were ruggerites who played school rugby in Britain before arriving here as young creepers. [creeping, a word said to have been created from the tongue-in-cheek observation that during this phase the new recruit would be, symbolically, made to creep beneath the bushes to discover the nuts and bolts of planting]. The pensioners on paydays do stick to their old attire of white drill full suit and hat whenever they visit to collect their purse. Some old haggard veterans would not miss the opportunity to take a walk around the club house viewing the portraits of yesteryear Suddha bosses appreciating their good work with veneration before they order their beers. 
I say, young man, will you come here; you must be fortunate to work for men of this calibre, you see, this is Mr John Capper, Tea Manager, he was the PD [Periya-Dorai] at Great Western, Talawakelle, and played for the up-country in the annual encounter against Colombo in the late 1920s. , this old man claimed with an expression of gratitude, when I responded to his call; he continued, He was my boss who recommended me for six increments in 1938, he contemplated for a while and said, those were the days my dear. A few of them would join in singing golden oldies to entertain the present Shawallians, who always admired the sentimentality in their expression of bittersweet nostalgia. 
The visit by a former Chairman, the 88-year old Shattock, who was accorded a warm reception by the Club in recognition of his services as the Companys Chairman and President of Sports Club in the 1930s became a day of reminiscence for the seniors. [Then it was Lee Hedges Ltd, prior to amalgamation with Shaw Wallace and Bois Brothers] Shattock, who hails from a family of planters captained Dimbulla -- in the first decade of 20th century went on to relate the history of Rugby in the island in his days. Let me share with the readers few things which have got etched in writers memory. 

Tea and Rugby in delicate Blend
Tea and Rugby in Ceylon harks back to the glorious days of one and a half centuries ago. Shattock never used the short term Rugby but always called the game Rugby Football. He said the game took roots here in the 1870s and it was exclusively the European Planters who represented the planting districts and all Ceylon at the game until early 20th century. Shattock had to travel great distances on foot to Radella to play the Dimbulla-Dickoya match; later, as a low country planter in the Galle district, he related how he used to cycle from his Estate to Galle Railway Station 12 miles, take train to Kalutara and cycle to a ground 10 miles interior and vice versa in the late 1900s, to play one hours gruelling rugby. Present day players may wonder whether it was sports or torture; and for sure, our school and club spectators who turn into unruly mobs at the end of a game may not grasp the story at all. All rugger enthusiasts must understand that it was men of that calibre that kept the game alive in the far off days. 
130 years ago, there were no proper rules; it was weight and brute strength that mattered. Those brawny men travelled on foot and bullock carts to get to the grounds was all in a days work. Then there were no orgasnised clubs in Colombo apart from the Services, added the octogenarian. 
Perhaps in good old days there was no hooliganism in Rugger and neither Pitch or match Fixing in cricket nor were there those crafty dishonest politicians in statecraft.

Giving value to biodiversity through team effort
	

Managing our natural assets more sustainably benefits farmers, environment and our diets 

Over the next few decades we have to eradicate hunger and do so for a growing population. 
And well have to do that amid climate trends that will require our food systems, starting with the agricultural sectors, to become increasingly flexible, resilient and adaptable. 
Providing nutritious food to a growing world population poses many challenges. To address these challenges we need to make crop and livestock systems, forests, fisheries and aquaculture more productive while guarantying the ability of landscapes and seascapes to provide other essential ecosystem services as regulation of air quality, soil fertility, crop pollination or even control of natural disaster like floods. 
Well need to put much natural capital  especially biodiversity - to work to achieve that. 
While the loss of biodiversity is occurring at an alarming rate, agricultural systems are becoming simpler, wider and more uniform with less diversity in terms of species, varieties and breeds. Some 150 livestock breeds have become extinct between 2000 and 2018. 

Action is requested to safeguard our planets rich resources
Our consumption choices also matter, especially as we are over exploiting what in fact is only a tiny share of natures bounty
We need to shift to more sustainable food systems with lower environmental costs

Nitrogen fertiliser
But globalized food systems have led to only a few crops providing the lions share of what we eat. Just eight crop species  dominated by wheat, rice and maize - provide more than half of our average daily food. Widespread use of nitrogen fertilisers has done wonders for output. But it has triggered water pollution that in turn provokes costly drinking-water crises for local communities. When carried by rivers to the sea, this creates dead zones hostile to marine ecosystems. 
Action is requested to safeguard our planets rich resources. What we need is a stronger and more focussed commitment to halt the losses of biodiversity for food and agriculture and make sustainable and equitable use of what remains while promoting diversification. 
We must consider biodiversity as a value across all sectors  in agriculture, fisheries, forestry - and beyond  even in how and what we consume. FAO has rolled out a Biodiversity Mainstreaming Platform precisely to foster the kind of cross-disciplinary dialogues that can lead to a transformational change in the way we face this challenge. 
Its an existential challenge and an achievable one. For millennia, farmers have cultivated and bred in a way that maintained ecosystems and species and conserved genetic resources for food and agriculture where the adoption and spread of best practices were a proxy for success. 
As agriculture is biodiversitys biggest user, it must become its ally. 
After all, the human touch need not be a disaster! A recent study in Brazil found that earthworm density  a proxy for soil biodiversity  is actually higher in areas practising minimal tillage or integrated crop-and-livestock practices than in areas people arent managing. 
The guiding principle is that we must manage our natural assets more sustainably. If we do, we can meet the worlds food demands while mitigating and avoiding the high deferred costs of the Green Revolution. 
Biodiversity is about dynamic relations rather than silver-bullet solutions. For example,pollinators such as bees can only benefit from reduced exposure to pesticides, but they also need ecological niches offering food and nesting areas. 

Our diets consumption choices
Biodiversity can also be fostered through our diets, very often to our own benefit. 
Different rice varieties can thrive in different climate conditions, and also offer a wider range of nutritional qualities  with up to eight-fold differences in iron content - underscoring the importance of efforts to conserve and support many cultivars. On top of that, planting diversified crops often lead to higher yields as harvests prove resilient to volatile pest, weather and farming conditions. 
Our consumption choices also matter, especially as we are over exploiting what in fact is only a tiny share of natures bounty. Nine crops account for more than two-thirds of all crop production, and around 200 practically all of it  even though over history we have used more than 30,000 plants for food and cultivated more than 6,000 of them. This leads to unwelcome outcomes such as micronutrient deficiency in Micronesia, where imported leafy green vegetables that locals dont appreciate have pushed the local yellow-fleshed giant swamp taro off the menu. 
Approaches such as agroecology and programmes like FAOs Globally Important Agricultural Heritage Systems, with its 50 designated sites around the world, are helpfully raising awareness both of agricultural biodiversitys ongoing importance and of the ingenious ways people harnessed it in the past to create mutually sustainable livelihoods and ecosystems. 
We need to shift to more sustainable food systems with lower environmental costs. And we must acknowledge that the agricultural sectors have the potential to contribute to the protection of biodiversity. Today there is a consensus; productive farming can provide environmental benefits while creating rural employment and sustaining livelihoods. Agroecology and other approaches can play a significant role. 
Recognizing, protecting and capitalizing on biodiversity demands a lot of teamwork. Its time to act together to achieve a common understanding, direction and commitment to protect diversity in order to produce enough nutritious food in the face of challenges, such as climate change, emerging diseases, pressures on feed and water supplies and shifting market demands of a growing human population.

Im not in the 118-list: Champika
	
Megapolis and Western Development Minister Champika Ranawaka yesterday pointed out that he is not among the 118 individuals who received funds from the Central Bank bond scam.
He made this remark while responding to questions from journalists in Kandy. We are the ones who taught the government to earn money and the ones who raised our voices against corruption. Im not among those who received money from the bond scam. I dont know whether you are also among the 118, he told journalists.
He also emphasised that President Maithripala Sirisena might not be aware of who created 100-day-programme but it was issued with their election manifesto for the last Presidential Election.
Minister Ranawaka said the country would become unstable if only the Executive Presidency was changed as it was the core of the Constitution. Therefore, the entire Constitution should be changed, he said.
He said that before abolishing the Executive Presidency, a stable parliamentary system should be formed via implementing the old electorate system.
Minister Ranawaka said that he doesnt like to comment further on what the President said as he is the countrys head. (J.A.L Jayasinghe)

IMPORTANT NOT TO DILUTE HARD-WON RTI VICTORIES
	

Some weeks ago, a group of Mannar based activists petitioned the Right to Information (RTI) Commission asking for details of the governments transitional justice package of reforms following promises made to the Geneva based Human Rights Council when this government came into power. Following the hearing of the appeal, the Prime Ministers Office released the proposed Reparations Bill to the RTI Commission. That was how the Bill came to be in the public domain. 
The Human Rights Commission (HRCSL) which had been recently given A-grade status by the international monitoring agency looking at performances of national human rights institutions, has stated that one of its biggest problems was getting access to Bills as these were not given to the HRCSL. This is despite the fact that the HRCSL law required the Commission to make recommendations in regard to draft legislation. The HRCSL had correctly questioned as to how it can engage in this task when the Bills are not sent to it. 
It is positive that draft laws are being released to the RTI Commission upon the direction of that Commission, which has been recently praised for its proactive stance and for showing remarkable independence by the International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) in the 2018 assessment of press freedoms report, Clampdowns and Courage. Earlier, the draft Disability Rights law was also released to the RTI Commission following an appeal filed by a legal activist. 
But do activists actually need to use the RTI law for this purpose Should not draft Bills be released to the people anyway as part of the automatic disclosure of the government as it is the people who will ultimately be affected by such laws Do they not have the right to see the drafts beforehand and make proposals in regard to the issues that may concern them 
Where the Reparations Bill was concerned, the Mannar activists had asked the Commission for the information on the basis that the rural people do not know what is happening in Colombo. They had said that they wanted to see the contents of the Bill to avoid a situation as what happened in regard to the Office of Missing Persons Act. The OMP Act states that information cannot be asked for when it amounts to confidential information supplied by relatives of missing persons to the OMP. But, as many have pointed out, this means that even if the relatives or others want it to be published, the OMP is under no duty to do so. 
From news reports after the release of the Reparations Bill, it has now become clear that though there are some restrictions similar to the OMP Act, at least the consent of the person who had given the information would be enough to have that information released under RTI where the Reparations Office is concerned. 
Other Bills propose worse restrictions. Yesterday, the Right to Information Commission issued a statement detailing its concerns in regard to the proposed Audit Bill that seeks to restrict requests being filed for information to the Audit Commission, the Auditor General and others acting under their authority, until the reports are filed in Parliament.
The RTI Commission has pointed out that the RTI Act does not place specific categories or classes of documents or the functioning of specific offices beyond the reach of information requesters. The Commission has warned that if new laws seek to do this, that will bring about a chilling effect on RTI and dilute the victories gained for Sri Lankans through the enactment of a globally-recognised law. 
The RTI Commission has also said that this would risk a gravely negative impact on the embryonic development of the countrys Right to Information regime and discourage largely positive tendencies evidenced so far by Public Authorities in dismantling a decades-old culture of secrecy and denial of legitimate information. This is a caution that is well founded. It should be seriously taken into account by policymakers.

Indias school texts promoting Modhis favourite policies: Critics
	

allege(c) 2018, The Washington Post  Vidhi Doshi  WORLD, ASIA-PACIFIC  Jun 01, 2018 - 7:49 PM
NEW DELHI - New school textbooks in India promoting Prime Minister Narendra Modis flagship policies have prompted fresh criticism that the government is using the education system to further his political agenda.
An analysis of 25 textbooks by the Indian Express newspaper found examples of newly-inserted paragraphs casting Modis policies in a positive light, including programmes like demonetizing that wiped out more than 85 percent of Indias cash or one to educate girls which has been criticized for lack of funding.
Critics maintain the changes to the textbooks are unbalanced and could skew childrens perceptions of politics and current events.
Modis government has been repeatedly criticized for being too image conscious and curbing freedom of the press, only giving scripted interviews to news organizations, and spending $638 million on publicity, including huge sums on newspaper advertisements and celebrity-studded television spots.

JO rejects Presidents allegations
	
In response to President Maithripala Sirisenas speech on Wednesday, May 31, the Joint Opposition said allegations made with regard to former President Mahinda Rajapaksa were unfounded.
Issuing a statement, its national organizer Dullas Alahapperuma said Presidents allegations were rejected in the strongest possible terms.
He said the President made certain allegations against his predecessor with regard to the use of a helicopter in the aftermath of his defeat, taking all security vehicles assigned to the Presidential Secretariat, and explosive detectors, and influencing investigations into the killing of ruggerite Wasim Thajudeen.
The statement said Mr Rajapaksa realized his impending defeat by 2.00 a.m. on January 9, following the Presidential Election in 2015, and got ready to leave his office despite advice by some of his close associates that he could stay there till the new President took the oath.
Mr Alahapperuma said Mr Rajapaksa displayed his statesmanship and vacated his office.
He said Mr Rajapaksa used a helicopter for the purpose as the President, who could stay in power till the new President was sworn in.
In this exercise, he did not contact any official yet to be appointed. He took the decision as the then Head of State. After ten hours of Mr Rajapaksa leaving his office, President Sirisena was sworn in. Therefore, Presidents allegations about the unlawful use of helicopter were baseless, he said.
He said Mr Rajapaksa retained only the security detail and vehicles required for him in keeping with threat assessment.
Referring to the allegations that explosive detectors were taken away, he said it was a total falsehood.
He said President Sirisena did not carry out any investigation into it for the last three-and-half-years if there were any.
Commenting on allegations regarding the killing of Wasim Thajudeen, he said it was proverbially similar to the festering wound of a beggar.
He said the Government could not complete investigations leading to the connection on this issue, and therefore various allegations had been fabricated and circulated in the social media.

Lasantha murder: Client was an 'unwilling accomplice' -counsel
	
When the Lasantha Wickramatunga murder trial was taken up for hearing, counsel for the second suspect told Mount Lavinia Magistrate Mohamed Mihal that his client, former Mount Lavinia Police Crimes branch OIC Tissasiri Sugathapala, is not a part of the offence but an unwilling accomplice.
Defense Counsel Rasika Weeratunga, appearing with Isuru Karaliyadda and Chandra Jagoda for the second suspect, told the Mount Lavinia Magistrate that his client was a suspect in the case due to death threats he had received from the third suspect, Prasanna Nanayakkara, who was the Senior Gazette Officer for the Western Division at the time.
He said although Sugathapala, his client, had performed his duties according to protocol and conducted investigations into the case, it was DIG Nanayakkara who had instructed him to destroy vital evidence by removing the pages of the GCIB and the Field Note Book belonging to late Sunday Leader Editor Lasantha Wickramatunga.
The Counsel further submitted that when Sugathapala refused to destroy evidence DIG Nanayakkara had threatened him saying he was following a directive from the then IGP and that he would also be killed like Lasantha if he does not adhere to the directive given to him.
The Counsel said Sugathapala had handed over the GCIB and the Field Note Book belonging to Wickramatunga to Nannayakara, but despite destroying the vital evidence he had secretly photocopied and preserved the evidence that helped the CID to obtain concrete proof against those behind the assassination.
He requested court to consider these facts and to grant bail to his client.
Senior State Counsel Janaka Bandara requested permission from the Magistrate to submit into evidence and provide photo copies of the statements made in camera by the second suspect and SP Hemantha Adikari to the prosecution.
The first suspect, military intelligence officer Premananada Udalagama, is out on bail
The CID arrested the former OIC Sub Inspector Sugathapala for concealing and destroying information pertaining to the murder of Wickramatunga. Further inquiries were fixed for June 12.

Priority to development; not to other issues- PM
	
It was essential to focus on countrys development at this moment instead of talking about other issues, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said yesterday.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said this during a ceremony held at Temple Trees to hand over appointment letters to 1,600 new Grama Niladharies (GS) last morning.
I have told the Ministers to spend their time for development and not to get entangled in other issues. We will have to work fulltime to fulfil development goals, he said.
More funds will be allocated for development this year. We need to build roads, restore tanks and generate self-employment schemes.
A sum of Rs 80 billion will be spent for development of villages. In addition, we will start up mega development projects such as the Central Expressway and the next phase of the Southern Expressway project. Fighting against crimes has also been expedited, the Prime Minister added.
We took over a country with a fallen economy in 2015. The education sector was also in a crisis. We borrowed funds for everything. A country cannot depend on borrowings forever.
The first two years of this Government was spent to stabilise the economy. State revenue is increased. We are currently in a position to repay our interests and allocate funds for development, he said.
He said the present regime was able to bring stability to the country during the past three years.
Grama Niladharis are a part of State machinery. They are the ones who implement Governments policy at the village level. Home Affairs Ministry has the responsibility to get the Government policies implemented, he stressed.
Minister of Home Affairs Vajira Abeywardene said the Grama Niladharis cannot get away from the responsibility of implementing the State policies.
You cannot say that you are not duty-bound to implement Government policies, he told the Grama Niladaries, who got appointment letters. (Yohan Perera)

Professor Samantha Hettiarachchi A student and engineer par excellence
	
Just a month has passed by since the demise of Prof. Samantha Hettiarachchi. He was a pioneer in the teaching of Coastal Engineering in Sri Lanka both at undergraduate and postgraduate levels, in the early 1980s Prof. Hettiarchchi did an extensive project study of the behaviour of the Kalu Ganga outfall which traversed from one end of the sand bar to the other end regularly causing certain resistance and obstruction to the river flow. His observations were made known in one of his first research papers presented jointly with me in 1983 at the International Coastal Engineering Conference. 
A Past President of the Institution of Civil Engineers, London on receiving the sad news has sent a message stating  ..I see Sam as a young and energetic man with many years left in him. What a tragedy for Sri Lanka... 
His interests and entry into the field of Coastal Engineering were memorable. He was the Acting / Vice Chairman of the Steering Group which he steered, of the Indian Ocean Tsunami Warning and Mitigation system under the auspices of the UNESCO. This was an outcome of the December 2004 Tsunami devastation. After that if there was any threat or speculation about another Tsunami attack I would contact him. In doing so I was often told dont worry, if there is a serious danger I will let you know !. For the record he read for his PHD in UK. 
He was a devout Buddhist.
In the initial stages of his post graduate Coastal Engineering career he did a survey on the performance of the Fishery harbours around the island and later on proceeded on to the mega ones. 
His fluency and eloquence in speech making with anecdotes will be well remembered.

Selathurai Gnanasegaram Blessings for a spiritual guru reaching 100
	
Its with profound love of my father Selathurai Gnanasegaram of Kokuvil East, Kokuvil, that I share his contribution to spiritual development on his up-coming 100th birth day. Arrangements have been made for a grand celebration at Sai Illam Thavaddy, Jaffna. 
Blessed by Kadayappa Swamis piece of meat given to M Selathurai who was childless, Gnanasegaram was born on the 1st of June 1918. His childhood was spent at Nallur Temple with his uncle Sabaratnam Mudaliyar. This led to the continuous worship and service to Lord Murugan of Nallur throughout his life. He completed his studies in Jaffna Hindu College. He joined the Fiscals Office at the age of eighteen and later served the Forest Department. 

Gnanasegaram cultivated spirituality through reading the divine history of the great saints and by visiting them. He was fortunate to be blessed by the great sage Siva Yoga Swamy of Columbuturai, Markandu Swamy and kudaichami and the great avathar of Kali Yuga Bagavan Sri Sathya Sai Baba

Six feet tall, lean, fair, pleasant and handsome Gnanasegaram was the attraction of many. As an admirer of Lord Siva he went to India to learn Bharathaatiyam under Naatya Kalakesari Vazhuvoor Ramaiah Pillai. Gnanasegaram trained students of Jaffna Hindu College, Jaffna Hindu Ladies College and Kokuvil Hindu College.
He considered music and dance as the modes to feel, see and surrender to Lord Shiva. 
Gnanasegaram married Rajaluxmy of Vannarpannai. They raised six children. 
Gnanasegaram cultivated spirituality through reading the divine history of the great saints and by visiting them. He was fortunate to be blessed by the great sage Siva Yoga Swamy of Columbuturai, Markandu Swamy and kudaichami and the great avathar of Kali Yuga Bagavan Sri Sathya Sai Baba. 
Siva Yoga Swamigal often blessed him and one day in front of many disciples named him Nalla Segaram. 
Gnanasegaram was called Iyah by many who associated with him in search of fulfilling their spiritual thirst. He translated Baja Govindam and Sai Literature and wrote five books as the essence of Truth.
A cluster of followers from Thavaddy Jaffna who identified Iyah and his mission have established Sai Illam.
The Sai Illam has now grown as a big banyan tree. 
Let us worship Iyah and follow his spiritual path as a real celebration of his hundredth birthday on this precious earth.

Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy ousted amid corruption scandal
	

After a bitter two-day debate in parliament, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy on Friday lost a no-confidence vote and was ousted from office. He will be replaced by a leader of the opposition Socialist Party.
The vote was 180 to 169 with one abstention.
Rajoy appeared in parliament Friday morning and in a brief speech said, I will accept the decision.
He added that, it has been an honour to be the leader of Spain and to leave it in a better state than the one I found. I believe I have satisfied my responsibility, which is to improve the lives of Spaniards. If I have offended someone in my role I ask forgiveness.
After navigating 25 percent youth unemployment, a territorial showdown with the restive Catalan region, and a financial crisis that threatened the solvency of the euro, Rajoy was brought down by the corruption scandals that have plagued his Popular Party.
Spains National Court handed down tough sentences last week to 29 individuals, including elected officials and business leaders, linked with the party.
The court ruled that the Popular Party benefited from a wide-ranging, systematic use of kickbacks from contracts. The crimes ranged from fraud and tax evasion to money laundering.
The crisis in Spain comes as populist, anti-immigrant and euro-skeptical parties in Italy struggle to cobble together a government and Britain faces a decisive round of negotiations later this month to leave the European Union.
After six years in office, Rajoy is set to be replaced by the opposition Socialist Party and its leader Pedro Snchez.

## Title: They need to be handled not systematically but immediately

They need to be handled not systematically but immediately
	

When you see some evil you proceed to immediate action, you make an immediate attack to cure the symptom.
~Johann Wolfgang von Goethe

In the Third World people go into government to enrich themselves. When patriotism and service have been sacrificed for bottomless appetite for personal avarice and indulgences, loyalty within the power bubble counts immeasurably. The Rajapaksa government managed to elevate that loyalty to a new level; a level that was beyond the average wage earner and self-employed vendor, the gram seller or coconut plucker. They attracted to their political abode partners, who were equal not only in that society-gutting greed and natural magnetism towards self-enrichment, who were hell-bent on destroying accepted norms and traditional human values. For them human life is of no greater value than the quick buck they could make by circumventing the so-called Administrative and Financial regulations (AR & FR) of public service. 
When AR and FR began its downward ride, Presidential decrees became the rule of law in the country. The Governor of the Central Bank became a mere pawn in the grand chessboard of a nasty political dynamic. Secretaries to President and the Ministry of Finance were executioners of devious acts of financial fraud. The siblings of the President became more powerful than senior ministers. There is no more evidence necessary than the current President who was a senior minister in that Cabinet until he said enough is enough, just before the presidential elections in 2015. Those senior minsters had to be satisfied with the bare bones while the meat, flesh and blood, including the marrow was sucked out by the First Family. It was against such a backdrop that the presidential election was held in January, 2015. 

The UNP, whose economic policies and principles are based on capitalism and the SLFP which advocates at every corner of the country a society that has to share its poverty instead of wealth were bound to clash when the time came. That timehas come

But a more profound tragedy occurred after the presidential elections. The platform that was so strongly built as a counter to the many misdeeds and criminal activities such as the slaying of Lasantha Wickramatunga, the then editor of the Sunday Leader newspaper and disappearance of another journalist, Prageeth Eknaligoda, could not withstand the stormy waves of the vicious propaganda of the joint opposition (JO). Not holding parliamentary elections immediately after the presidential elections in 2015 came to haunt the current Administration, as is seen today. That blame is held against Maithripala Sirisena, the new President. His ambition to salvage the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) instead of looking after those who elected him, the Northern and Estate Tamils, Muslims all over the country and the United National Party (UNP), the traditional rival of the SLFP, overshadowed the real purpose of the election. 
Two strategic blunders were committed not only by Mahinda Rajapaksa opting out of the leadership of the SLFP, and Maithripala Sirisena too, by betraying his voters and embracing the SLFP which he left to become the Common Candidate against the Rajapaksas. Had Mahinda Rajapaksa chosen not to withdraw from the leadership of the SLFP, he would not have had to grapple with the current impasse the SLFP is in. He would have been the undisputed King of his party and would have been a much more formidable threat to the current government. Had Sirisena chosen to stick with the common platform (Northern and Estate Tamils, Muslim conglomeration and the UNP), instead of choosing to salvage his former SLFP, he would not have had this disunited Unity Government and maybe, just maybe, the UNP would have had to choose him again as the next Candidate for the forthcoming presidential election. 
This double-jeopardy committed by the double - Ms, Mahinda and Maithripala, took its unkind toll. The wisdom of this inept and disparate double-move will be the subject talked about by many a social scientist and historian yet to come. But we, as contemporaneous writers, can indulge in the analysis of such a foolhardy strategy hugged by our leaders. 
The people at large are paying a very high price for a commodity that is rotten and soiled to the core. The momentum of defeating the spoiled brats of power, the Rajapaksas, is lost. The loss of momentum has in turn engendered a lackadaisical approach to the countrys financial woes created by the Rajapaksas. Instead of a UNP cabinet led by a UNP Prime Minister and a common President, Sri Lanka is being led by a UNP cum SLFP Cabinet headed by a clumsy duo of party leaders whose primary goal is safeguarding their own self-interests. The UNP, whose economic policies and principles are based on capitalism and the SLFP which advocates at every corner of the country a society that has to share its poverty instead of wealth were bound to clash when the time came. That time has come. The basic clash between the two philosophies which are diametrically opposed to each other has produced the current gridlock. The birth of crony capitalism which occurred somewhere in the mid nineteen-nineties (1990s) has come of age from its pangs. That vicious subtext of capitalism has continued its meandering journey triggering unforgiving circumstances turning the politically pious into a venomous creed of political scavengers. Their prey is the national coffers and an ill-fated people whose susceptibilities are beyond repair. 
This session of predator-prey game has been in play for the last twenty five years. Thats a long time for any cultural pattern to set in. The prey gets used to its being used by the predator to unimaginable extents, until the prey gets intensely enveloped in the web, hardly noticing that its very survival becomes dependent upon lengths to which the prey gets consumed by its own blood. This morbid survival game has been continuing unhindered, without the knowledge either of the predator or the prey. 
We have reached the depths of that existence. The cynical politician has realized that stark truth. His willful participation in the deception of the voter is exponentially expanding. The politician and the voter, one feeding on the other, have bonded together, forming a bizarre relationship to sustain a self-destructive dynamic whose irreversible passage doesnt look all that unrealistic. People at large dont seem to have either the time or the willingness to sort this curious collection of social energies out by themselves. So they look to the politicians whose wicked activities have clouded the whole issue of corruption, nepotism and wanton killings and disappearances ofpolitical opponents. 

In the Third World people go into government to enrich themselves. When patriotism and service have been sacrificed for bottomless appetite for personal avarice and indulgences, loyalty within the power bubble counts immeasurably

The deliberate attempts and carefully crafted propaganda gimmicks engineered by the Rajapaksas and his henchmen have taken a full toll of Sri Lankan mindset. As an unintended and collateral damage of these shocking schemes are our culture and traditions. These traditions and values have taken a blast from the Rajapaksa-led regime. A society that was being gradually swallowed by the jaws of Capitalisms ill-effects strode more vigorously during the Rajapaksa-rule. They calculated that the war-victory against Prabhakaran and other Tamil militants gave them an open licence to kill and rape the country they thought they saved. 
But this writers grievance is this: when elected to power on an unambiguous platform of undoing the Rajapaksa-rule, instead of undoing those society-destroying acts immediately, they adopted a more slow process of systematic handling. Systematic handling is another phrase for not handling. Period. 
Ranil Wickremesinghe, if he still frits with the idea of winning at a presidential election, has one chance and one chance only. He has to go after the corrupt Rajapaksas and bring them before justice. Not tomorrow or day after, but yesterday! He doesnt have time, maybe six months. With the dawn of the next year, the country will be on a campaign-roll. At the beginning of 2019, the people will be beginning to form their opinions on the forthcoming presidential election due within 12 to 13 months thereon. His covert attempt at driving a telling wedge in the SLFP has fallen flat. President Sirisenas share in the SLFP seems to be less than a pathetic 5%! The rest is with Mahinda Rajapaksa and his gang and that was well articulated in the 2015 Presidential Election itself, which was later reconfirmed at the recently concluded local government elections. 
Therefore, in the context of the failure of this master strategy to divide the SLFP in the middle, Ranil Wickremesinghes space for further manoeuvrering has shrunk. If he wishes to nominate himself as the next UNP candidate for President in 2020, Ranil has to move fast. The recent Band-Aid solutions introduced into the UNP structure do not mean anything unless and until the fundamental issue of prosecuting the Rajapaksas for their alleged felonies is settled. If, however, Ranil Wickremesinghe decides to introduce another candidate other than himself for the 2020 presidential elections, either Navin Dissanayake or Sajith Premadasa, the prognosis will be certainly different. A new face, for that matter, a much younger one than anyone else in the field now, would attract a lot of attention provided a correct branding and campaign plan is executed.

UNP will respond to President next week Harin
	
The United National Party (UNP) would reveal the truth and would respond to the statement made by President Maithripala Sirisena on the Hundred-Day Programme from next week, its newly appointed Spokesman Harin Fernando said yesterday.
 We will speak about the programme and other things from next Monday when we launch out Sathya (Truth) Campaign, Minister Fernando said in response to a question raised by journalists as to how would the UNP respond to the sentiments expressed by President Sirisena on the Hundred-Day-Programme.
We will launch the UNPs Central Media Unit and the Sathya Programme on Monday.
The party has decided to start up a Central Media Unit and the Sathya Programme as the party feels that is being neglected.
We feel that the truth is hidden especially considering what had taken place during the last few days, he added.
It is our duty to speak the truth and educate the people. Media has the responsibility to inform the truth to the people and people too, have the responsibility to understand what is right. Everyone should understand the truth, he said.
He said one truth the UNP was going to reveal was that it was the only party that could get an ordinary citizen elected as the President of this country.
The UNP is a party which has an ability to get an ordinary man elected as President though some have forgotten it. We have fielded those who emerged among ordinary people right form late President Premadasa, Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka and President Maithripala Sirisena, who comes from Polonnaruwa as our Presidential Candidate in the past, he said.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe who handed over the appointment letter to Minister Fernando said the latter was given the task of heading the publicity unit of the party as he was a capable man.
It was Harin who laid the foundation for us to win the Presidential and General Elections in 2015, he said.
He said the publicity unit was created in line with the partys decision to create a new generation of leaders. (Yohan Perera)
