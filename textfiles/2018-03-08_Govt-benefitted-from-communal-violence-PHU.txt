Govt. benefitted from communal violence: PHU


	

The government has benefitted from the recent acts of violence in the country, the Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) said yesterday.

PHU General Secretary and MP Udaya Gammanpila told a news conference that the pressure on political parties including the United National Party (UNP) to remove Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe from his post had now been suppressed due to the spree of terror attacks instigated by communal violence.

“The joint opposition will not be benefitted from these incidents in any manner. We, as the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), have won the majority of votes from the Sinhalese in the recent election. We now attempt to win the votes of the minority groups. The JO or SLPP does not need to attack any community."

"However, the UNP is having a huge benefit over these barbaric acts. If this uncivilized behaviour do not stop immediately, the country will face a huge crisis in future. I am requesting all Sinhalese to intervene and bring this situation under control,” he said. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)
