One person drowned and another went missing when a trawler boat carrying five fishermen from Devundara toppled in seas off Kirinda this afternoon, where the rest of the fishermen were rescued by another trawler.
The trawler boat that left shores on the Christmas Day from Devundara carrying five fishermen had met with the accident around 3.30pm yesterday about 10 nautical miles off the Pothuwila shore in Kirinda.
Police Spokesman ASP Ruwan Gunasekara said another trawler boat that launched from the Benthara shores had come across the ill-fated boat with its occupants were hanging on to it in the sea.
The second boat had saved three fishermen who were struggling for their lives whilst the body of a drowned victim was also recovered. Another fisherman was missing in the water.
The fishermen of the second boat had radio messaged the coastal authorities saying that they had salvaged three fishermen and one body.
They were bound towards Devundara fisheries harbour when this edition went to press last night.
The ASP said the prevailing rough weather condition would have caused the boat to topple.
Gandara Police conducting investigations have identified the fishermen to be residents of Devundara.
The drowned victim who’s recovered body had been identified as Ajith Supun (45) and the 40-year-old Pradeep Chandana had gone missing. (Kurulu Koojana Kariyakarawana)
