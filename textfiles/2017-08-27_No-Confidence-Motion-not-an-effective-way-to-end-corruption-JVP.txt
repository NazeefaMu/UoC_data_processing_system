No Confidence Motion not an effective way to end corruption -JVP


	

Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) today said it would vote in favour of No Confidence Motion brought in against Minister of Health Dr. Rajitha Senaratne, although such motions were not an effective way to get rid of corruption.


JVP leader and Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake told a media briefing that his party would vote in favour of the motion as Minister Senaratne was not fit to hold the Ministerial portfolio for several reasons.


"The Minister is deliberately delaying the settlement of SAITM issue because his Daughter-in-Law is a student at the said private medical college. This is a conflict of interest," Mr. Dissanayake said.


He said his party did not intend to support the Minister for reasons, such as these.
However, he said No Confidence Motions were not an effective way to get rid of corruption.
“One must bring in a motion condemning the socio-economic system, instead of playing musical chairs and unseating Ministers from time to time,” he said. (Yohan Perera)
