	The government is to conduct a forum of world renowned economists including some attached to the Harvard University , to advise on the implementation of the economic policy plan laid down by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, a Deputy Minister said yesterday.
	Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Dr. Harsha de Silva told the Daily Mirror that this would be done early January.
	He said these economists would advise the government on the implementation of these policies over a period.
	“We are going to consult the best economists in the world. They may be from different countries. This is organised by the Ministry of International Trade. There are economists attached to Harvard University, to attend it,” he said.
	Ahead of the budget, the Prime Minister, in a statement to the House, outlined the economic policy.
	Generation of one million economic opportunities, enhancing income levels, development of rural areas, ensuring land ownership to rural and estate sectors, and the middle class and government employees, and creating a wide and strong middle class are the aims of this economic policy.
	The 2016 budget also serves as a roadmap for the achievements of these targets. (Kelum Bandara)
