Even though the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) was having a difficult time, it was not worth abandoning for short term benefits, Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala De Silva today said.

While addressing a SLFP electorate meeting held at the Badulla Postal Auditorium, the Minister made the above remark and said the party should be saved for long term rather than following short term advantages.

“There were times we lost elections and lost our positions, however, we survived and we were able to protect the party. Each and every single member has a shared responsibility to safeguard the SLFP. Even though there are some misgivings we should work towards the betterment of the party,” he said.

Minister Siripala also said creating a new political party was not an answer to resolve the matters. He stressed that whatever the issue, it should be solved within the party. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
