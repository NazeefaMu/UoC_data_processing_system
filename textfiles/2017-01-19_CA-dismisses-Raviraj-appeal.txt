CA dismisses Raviraj appeal


	

The Court of Appeal today dismissed the appeal filed in court against the acquittal of five accused by the Colombo High Court recently, in the killing of former Parliamentarian Nadaraja Raviraj and his driver.

When the appeal was taken into consideration today by the Court of Appeal, the complainants were not present in court, and hence the court dismissed the appeal.

The appeal was put forward by Shashikala Raviraj, widow of Mr. Raviraj in court as aggrieved party of the High Court trial.

Following the trial conducted in the presence of a special jury at Colombo High Court, the five suspects including three Navy intelligence officers were acquitted by the court based on the verdict of the special jury. (Shehan Chamika Silva)
