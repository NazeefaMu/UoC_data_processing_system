LOLC Securities Limited (LOSEC), the stockbroking company of the diversified conglomerate, the LOLC group, recently conducted a workshop on capital market and mobile app awareness. 
The workshop was organised in collaboration with the Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri Lanka (SEC) and Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) with the objective of creating awareness on capital market and online trading through the new mobile app. 
The programme was held recently at the Sri Lanka Institute of Information Technology (SLIIT) in Malabe. 
About 300 undergraduates took part in the capital market and mobile app awareness workshop, which was held with the participation of the senior officials and representatives from LOLC Securities, the SEC and CSE. 
The workshop covered a range of key topics including the benefits of investing in capital market instruments, how to make use of online trading facilities in the capital market as well as the regulatory aspects relevant to the capital market of Sri Lanka.
Commenting about the workshop, LOLC Securities Limited Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer Sriyan Gurusinghe said, “This joint workshop is a timely initiative. In an age when technology is developing rapidly with constant innovation, we need to create awareness that investors can now manage their investments with great ease, anytime and from anywhere. This mobile trading app offers live streaming prices, charts, latest news on stock trading and much more.”
During the workshop, LOLC Securities donated a real-time market viewer monitor screen to SLIIT in order to facilitate and display live market streaming at the SLIIT University premises. The main objective of this donation is to provide real-time updates on the capital market as well as expand and broad base exposure for the capital market among all stakeholders in order to build a sustainable relationship between both institutions.
This workshop, the first of its kind in Sri Lanka, was conducted by a stockbroking firm in collaboration with a private university with representation from all stakeholders in the capital market of Sri Lanka.
Established in 2011, and now a fully-owned subsidiary of the LOLC group, LOLC Securities has been built for excellence in all its dimensions, keeping in mind the assurance sought by discerning investors.
