Gentlemen to take over the gentlemen’s game?


	



 

The one who came into cricket administration from a ‘new world’ had got so sick of his job he submitted his resignation some time ago. But the authorities above him was just sitting on his letter of resignation making no response either way. 

 


Meanwhile, reports say, that the palace had sent for him to hear from the horse’s mouth the real cause for the popular game that once rose to a glorious height to fall into an abysmal depth today.

 
The one from the ‘New World` had recounted to Number One, carefully choosing every word, the circumstances that had led the game to the parlous state it is in today. At this meeting Number One had told him that he would take a very firm decision after his return from the official visit to the States. 
The day a group of persons with a genuine concern for the game will take over the running of the game after a set of parasites being kicked out, is not far away, say informed sources.
