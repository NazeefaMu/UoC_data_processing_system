Commercial Bank of Ceylon has opened its 14th Agriculture and Micro Finance Unit (AMFU) in Neluwa in the Galle District to facilitate the bank’s efforts to support micro, small and medium entrepreneurs in the area including commercial-scale agriculture entrepreneurs.


The opening coincided with the celebration of the 10th anniversary of the bank’s Neluwa branch, to which the new AMFU is affiliated.


The unit will work closely with the Commercial Bank branches in Neluwa, Udugama and Matugama to help business build capacity, expand operations, acquire new equipment and adopt new technology, the bank said. 


The agricultural activities in the regions covered encompass tea plantations and smallholdings, rubber plantations, paddy, cinnamon and pepper cultivation and the manufacture of cinnamon products. Commercial Bank’s Agriculture and Micro Finance Units play a key role in helping the bank identify specific needs of people who require assistance to develop either their agriculture activities or small businesses and are dedicated to promoting agriculture lending and microfinance and resolving difficulties. These units also conduct programmes to enhance domain knowledge and financial literacy among entrepreneurs in the target segments.


Commercial Bank’s other Agriculture and Micro Finance Units are located in Ratnapura, Narammala, Kandy, Anuradhapura, Kilinochchi, Bandarawela, Monaragala, Hingurakgoda, Galewela, Atchuvely, Vavuniya, Kattankudy and Tissamaharama.
