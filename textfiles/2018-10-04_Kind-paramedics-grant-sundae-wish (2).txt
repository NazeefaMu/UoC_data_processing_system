Kind paramedics grant sundae wish


	



In Queensland, Australia recently, two young female paramedics went out of their way to provide a special last treat for Ron McCartney, who was terminally ill.  Arriving in the ambulance to escort him to hospital and then onto a palliative care facility, the paramedics found out he hadn’t eaten for days. They then asked him if there was anything in the world he would especially love to eat – he replied “a caramel sundae from McDonalds”.   The paramedics made a detour in the ambulance to grant his wish.  A rapt Ron thoroughly enjoyed his sundae and this kind gesture brought overwhelming happiness to not only to Ron, but also to his family in his last days.
