Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka sworn in as MP

Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka took oaths as a Parliamentarian for the second time before Speaker Karu Jayasuriya yesterday. He took oaths to fill the vacancy created by the death of UNP National List MP M.K.A.D.S. Gunawardena.
Gunawardena died last month.
Fonseka was elected to Parliament for the first time in the 2010 general election and lost his seat after being convicted in the White Flag case in November 2011.
Speaker Jayasuriya yesterday announced Fonseka's name to be sworn in as a new MP, soon after Parliament sittings commenced. Sergeant-at-Arms Anil Parakrama Samarasekera accompanied Fonseka to the Speaker's table. Field Marshal Fonseka was sworn in accordingly while the entire House stood up in accordance with tradition. After taking oaths, the Field Marshal was accompanied to his seat by the Sergeant-at-Arms. Meanwhile, other MPs congratulated him and Fonseka was seen greeting the Prime Minister in traditional style and the other government and opposition members.
