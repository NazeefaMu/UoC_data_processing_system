A date with ‘The Dictator’

For someone who is going through a bout of flu, Namel Weeramuni sounds surprisingly and reassuringly like his normal, jovial self when I speak with him about his new play, ‘The Dictator’ which debuted in late October at the Punchi Theatre and will go on the boards again on 2nd, 3rd, and 4th of December.
He says when H.C.N. De Lanerolle's son, Prof. Primal de Lanerolle suggested he directs three of his father's plays, he chose ‘The Dictator’ first as he felt this play had more relevance to the times we are living in today. Apart from the political innuendoes which seem to fit into our recent past so well, in spite of the fact that the play was written in the 1950s, he feels what is most alluring in ‘The Dictator’ is the ‘universal theme’ around which the play revolves, a theme that is common to all married men, regardless of time, space, caste or race: “The dominance of the wife over her husband. It's an eternal theme,” he chuckles.
I'm only too eager to point out, though, that the play ends with the dictator's confident proclamation, “I may not be the Dictator of Ceylon. But I am the dictator at home.” Namel Weeramuni bursts into laughter again. “That's what we think,” he grins, “but it is never like that in real life. We are all dominated by our wives.”
He says it mattered little to him that he had never watched ‘The Dictator’ when it was first staged in the mid 20th century, because whenever he adopts a play he gives it his own interpretation; his own unique signature. This sense of individuality enhanced by the remarkable stage set designed by Lal Harendranath, the attractive costumes by Senaka de Silva, make-up by Buddhi Galappaththi and music by Jayathissa Alahakoon all add to the enchanting aura that surrounds ‘The Dictator'.
Satire at its best
Among the plays of H.C.N. De Lanerolle that Namel Weeramuni had watched in his student days were, ‘He Came from Jaffna’ and ‘Well Mudaliyar'. This was during an era in which those who belonged to the so called “high class’ frequented the Lionel Wendt to watch English plays. He recalls those were the days when an evening at the theatre would probably have looked like the scene at the Ascot racetrack in Shaw's ‘Pygmalion’ when everyone came dressed to the nines, as if they were going to a pageant.
Regardless of when it is staged be it in the 1950s or in the present, ‘The Dictator’ is undoubtedly satire at its best. As we laugh at the antics of Ralahamy and Mahaththaya we are laughing at ourselves: at the way we translate Sinhala phrases into English, “If they ask me I will tell and give,” is Ralahamy's favorite phrase, and at our beliefs in the occult sciences as well as the unequal distribution of power between Ralahamy and Hamine, superbly played by Malini Weeramuni. If Hamine, obeys the wishes of Ralahamy, you can rest assured that it happens only in Ralahamy's dreams.

While Pinnya Samarathunga's Stella acts as foil to Hamine's over-reactions, thin, bespectacled, Galpotha (Prabhath Dhevidra) who is the reporter from the Daily News and Nella (Purnima Pilapitiya/Kiruthika Thurairajah) the no-nonsense woman of steel from the Times of Ceylon make those of us who are in the print-media laugh at ourselves. Pradeep Kumara who makes brief appearances as the exorcist effectively conveys the mystery that lurks in the occult sciences and injects a jab of fear into the minds of even the non-believers.
‘Alright, alright’
It is hard not to smile when Mahattaya (Daya Tennekoon) keeps introducing the dictator in such a way that it sounds as though he is calling out to “The Director”. Specially when we know the relentless perfectionist Namel Weeramuni is as a director. It is a well known fact that he is strict and hot-tempered if the actors do not know their lines or fail to meet the high standards he expects from his cast during rehearsals. Mahattaya is not wrong after all, when he introduces the dictator as the director. “I am the real dictator,” assures Namel Weeramuni, with the happy laughter of someone who has accomplished his goal in reviving this classic play.
From one dictator to the other. I hear him, before I see him. A cat is meowing in the background and he is saying in a gentle, soothing voice, ‘Alright, alright, you can go out now,”. A black and white cat steps into the sitting room, gives me a look that says she is royalty and walks out the front door. In her wake comes Wijerathne Warakagoda.
He peers at me over his glasses, and begins our conversation with those very lines he immortalizes in ‘The Dictator’, as the dictator. “Hm...let me look and see... I will tell and give...if not things will get worser than useless.” Thus, with these fragments from the play, we begin and end ‘act one’ in his living room in Kalubowila.
‘Act two’ is all about his other English play, for, amazingly in his long career as an actor ‘The Dictator’ is only his second play in English. “The first was called ‘The Killer,’ and was staged in the 1970s. It was a comedy well received at the time.” We laugh, when we realize he has moved from being The Killer in the 70s to The Dictator in the 21st century. Wijerathne Warakagoda attributes this lapse between his first English play and the second, to the fact that he never goes behind directors asking for them to give him a role in a play. “I wait for them to come to me, and when they offer me a role I agree to do it, no matter what the role is.” He insists he is not choosy with the roles he plays but admits he loved being the dictator.

Who would not, as the role gives him the chance to bring laughter into the lives of fellow Sri Lankans. Yet, in real life he is far from being a dictator, he assures me. “Unlike Ralahamy, I don't believe in the so called occult sciences,” he says. Then he acts out the last few lines of the play. He recalls the dream where there is “No one to put the breaks. Everyone is obeying me. Even Hamine”. Then, he decides to become a dictator at home. I can't resist asking him if this is true in real life too. “Not at all,” he smiles. “My wife and I are equal when it comes to wielding power at home. There are no dictators here.”
Satisfied
He says he is satisfied with his interpretation of Ralahamy even though he had not seen the Dictator when it was first staged. He laughs over the Sri Lankan English in the script and admits memorizing these Singhlish lines was more difficult than it would have been if they were in the normal British English we are used to. “Now two times I told. Sit down” he roars, waving his index finger at me. Even though he is dressed in a white, long-sleeved shirt and black trousers, as he says the words he turns into the dictator and for the briefest of seconds I see him dressed in the regal garb in which he appears on stage, right in front of me. Then he enacts for me, the best line in the play, which I feel only he could say in that unique Sinhala accent that makes the audience collapse in laughter. Dismissing the Latin term “Proforma” Hamine uses to explain why they looked at their horoscopes when they got married, he tells her not to talk in Latin with him, because, “Latin is Greek to me!”
As I leave the two dictators, basking in their glory I realize the real dictator is neither director, Namel Weeramuni nor leading-actor, Wijerathne Warakagoda. Make it to the Punchi Theatre on 2nd, 3rd and 4th December to meet the real dictator and find out all about her.
A warning to all men, before I go. Don't try this at home!
