The Kaduwela-Biyagama main bridge would be closed for the vehicular movement from 10 pm today to 5 am tomorrow for renovations, the Police said.

The vehicular movement along the Kaduwela-Biyagama main bridge was restricted since last morning because of the soil erosion along the Kelani River Bank connecting to the bridge. (DS)
