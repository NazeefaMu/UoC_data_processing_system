They didn’t consider him patriotic or honest!


	

A prominent political figure who attended as the chief guest at the ceremonial opening of the party office of a fair and lovely Diyawanna member in her new electorate, had to suffer much discomfiture when a section of the gathering openly demonstrated their displeasure at his presence at the event. 

 


There is widespread public opinion that this prominent politico is involved in a big way in a big fraud that created a major sensation in the country.


The politico’s arrival had at the very outset sent a ripple of general displeasure through the crowd which had grown restive, when the fair member later in her welcome speech had begun praising the politico describing him as a patriot and an honest servant of the people.


Some unhappy party activists had started leaving the venue, while the meeting was in progress as a show of their protest, they say.
