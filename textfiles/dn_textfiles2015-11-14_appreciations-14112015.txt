[Appreciations]-14.11.2015


Sharmini Tennakoon:
A sister like no other
It was past midnight last year on November 10 when my brother Anil rang me and conveyed the sad news that my sister Sharmini had passed away.
Had she followed the doctor’s advice earlier that evening and gone back for the nebulizer test she would have still been with us. The fact of the matter was that she was not concerned about her own health but cared for others.
She had a commitment to care for the less fortunate, specially children. During the tsunami days, working for the YWCA, she went out of her way to get some funds from overseas to build houses for those in the beach area in Panadura whose houses had been washed away. They were filled with gratitude and came to pay their respects on the day of her funeral.
My sister worked very closely with the YWCA over the years, arranging programmes like drama, harvest festivals, sing alongs, and conducting health clinics. She was doctor on call for me. Even for a common cold she advised me what to take. Sharmini was a regular radio listener to the SLBC and often requested songs of her choice. On many occasions along with her late husband Indra, she organised Christmas and birthday parties at their home. Two weeks prior to her death, she rang me and said she would do everything for my birthday on October 27 and planned the whole menu. Before she left my home, she promised to do the same the following year, but a few days after that she passed away.
A large crowd was present at her funeral to show their gratitude, including many members of the YWCA. She was excellent in English like our father, and used to write to the press regularly. She worked as a librarian at the public library both at Panadura and Colombo.
My sister was a good practicing Christian and served the Catholic Church in Panadura in her later years.
Had she cared more about her health, she would have still been with us. We sincerely miss her, but there are no “tears in heaven”.

Keerthi Sri Karunaratna :
Charming, well mannered and simple
The most senior king of the fashion world is no more! After nearly six decades of untiring work, he left us. It is undoubtedly a great loss to the fashion conscious females, especially a few who craved for publicity.
Keerthi, to everybody who knew him, was a charming, well mannered, simple and an unassuming person who was sincere and honest up to the letter.
He was a man of few words, who firmly believed in the adage, “Lend your ear, to every man, but few thy voice,Take every man Censure but, reserve thy judgement.” (Shakespeare)
He never spoke ill of others nor did he carry tales against his clients. That was one secret of his popularity.
At an interview with the print media once, he recalled his salad days as a young fashion designer.
"I started my fashion career just after leaving Ananda College, Colombo. I had a love for art and that kindled my talents in designing clothes, my mother was my first model.”
Paying a tribute to his mother he commented: "It was her patience, that I inherited later, which paved my way to success as a designer."
He had a rare talent of turning out ugly ducklings to angels with his expertise in makeup. He was well recognised by all he knew him for his genuine comments that never gave hard feelings to any of them.
He was very hospitable and never failed to serve his visitors with his favourite food, club sandwiches with asparagus.
The thousands of females dressed by him include brides, models, and beauties for parades.
He was so humble in his speech that it takes me back to a comment he made once: "I am saving money to visit USA."
He fulfilled his desire before he bade good bye forever. He travelled by bus and continued to save for the trip.
He passed away recently after a prolonged illness. It is undoubtedly a great loss to the fashion conscious females both young and old! May he attain the eternal bliss of Nirvana!!

John Newton Fernando:
He did much for us
It is with a deep sense of gratitude that I pen these few lines on behalf of my brother and sister about my father, John Newton Fernando who died on October 16 at the age of 95.
His father, Marshall Fernando was a brilliant cricketer and scored the first century for St. Benedict's College. Having completed his education at St. Mary's College, Negombo, he joined a private bank and was also their goal keeper. At the time of his death, he was the oldest living pensioner at the bank. He was a gifted musician and could play any instrument and participated in many musical programmes at the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation along with famous singers like Vincent de Paul Peries, Patrick Denipitiya and others.
He married Doreen Fernando in 1949.
My father helped me and my brother to be champion athletes at St. Benedict's College from under 13 to 19 and also to win public school athletic meets. This is a temporary departure and we know when the Lord comes for his bride, his soul, now in the presence of the Lord, will be brought and given a new body to live with him eternally and if we are alive, our bodies will be changed and given new bodies and will join him to meet the Lord in the air [1 thessolonians ch4:13-17]

Hameed Abdul Kareem:
A longstanding friend
O ye who believe! stand out firmly for justice, as witnesses to Allah, even as against yourselves, or your parents, or your kin, and whether it be (against) rich or poor: for Allah can best protect both. Follow not the lusts (of your hearts), lest ye swerve, and if ye distort (justice) or decline to do justice, verily Allah is well- acquainted with all that ye do.Verse 135 of Surah Al Nisa (The Women) of the Noble Qur’an.
Hameed Abdul Kareem that we knew is someone who lived by this command of Allah, the Most Just. Hameed was a man of principle who spent his time, mind and energy on the path of justice and care for other human beings.
His heart would warm, his mind would cogitate and his body would haste to act, whenever and wherever he saw people suffer injustice or oppression. His constant words for those who are suffering, against the perpetrators, spoke of his relentless determination to get the message across, to be a voice for the voiceless.
Hameed was a longstanding friend, who was a livewire at the Sri Lanka Committee for Solidarity with Palestine. He identified himself with the struggle of the Palestinian people, who lost their loved ones, their lands, their livelihoods and their country but never lost their dignity or resolve.
Hameed never missed a meeting, as long as he was in Sri Lanka, or never missed a commitment. His concern and energy were contagious, able to awaken good souls to empathize and act.
Prophet Muhammed said, “The best of people are those that bring most benefit to the rest of mankind.”
Indeed, we felt he was amongst the best of us, while he was with us. May Allah, with His Grace, make him amongst the best in the Hereafter, and grant him the highest level of paradise.

Dr. Shankilal Seresinhe:
He led a full life
Fifteen years ago on November 13 morning my husband and father of Avantha and Ruwini passed away suddenly.
His death at the age of 51 came as a severe shock to me and to my children as well as to our family members, relatives, colleagues and friends.
After completing higher studies in Switzerland, he returned to Sri Lanka in 1992 and served the University of Ruhuna for a short time.
Both of us with post-graduate qualifications from Switzerland and as a family started our lives and university carriers with a fresh outlook. None of the many people whom he met would have ever thought that within a few years he would depart from us for good.
Everyone thinks that I am strong and has moved on.
“Adequate time has passed,” they say. What is adequate time? I was left with my two children, 18-year-old son and eight and a half year old daughter. I had to continue but I still feel so lonely at times without my husband, precious father, batch mate, colleague,friend and an academic of the same university.
He has been such an integral part in our lives. With his sudden departure, a great vacuum was created in our lives, because, I lost his great partnership which we developed through years sharing all aspects in our lives.
I met him for the first time in 1973 at Mahailluppallama sub-campus during the first year practical training of our undergraduate career.
He was very friendly and cheerful at all times and shared his knowledge gathered during school days with us. Subsequently, we became good friends and I knew that there was something special about him.
He was my very first friend at the university. He has been my best friend ever since and we became wonderful friends and were inseparable. Ultimately we became lifelong partners until his untimely death.
All of us who knew Sera find it hard to reconcile ourselves. But we have the satisfaction of knowing that although it’s short, he lived a full life; performed his duties devotedly and meticulously as a husband, father, son, and brother and also as an academic.
He left an enormous reservoir of goodwill and fond memories. Sera was a dedicated teacher who often demonstrated his practical experiences to the students. His talented teaching and practical lessons conducted for under graduates are being still conversed among the staff and students.
Sera was always honest in all his dealings, adhered to principles and was unbiased, which amply reflected his refined teaching and administrative carrier at the university.
He was very strict about his own and family discipline as well as of the university students. Sera was a very independent person who managed his own affairs well and was satisfied with what he had.
Still as a family, we respect his great virtues and try to live the way he led us by example. As a Christian married to a Buddhist, he allowed the children to follow a religion of their choice with an open mind, typically illustrating Sera’s nature and attitude towards many such aspects in his life.
He always wanted to have a closely knit family life with full of love and affection to each other.
He also had a pioneering spirit and a desire to educate the son and daughter with great care and to give them meaningful lives. However, I am revived and strengthened and even given courage by his spirit to take on my family in to greater heights. So far I am happy with the progress of our family and achievements of our children.
I believe that we have so far lived up to his expectations with great respect to him. My grievance is that, he is not fortunate enough to share the achievements of our children along with me.
He got others to agree to his will not with brashness or aggression, but with quiet poise, dignity and his own distinctive brand of compassion.
For me, Sera represented a kind of ideal academic, administrator and a true gentleman. But above all that, he was my loving husband and precious father of my children.

Dr. Ajantha Horadagoda:
An inspiring teacher
This is a personal tribute to Dr Ajantha Horadagoda who passed away on October 18, 2015 in Sydney, Australia.
Dr. Horadagoda was my biochemistry teacher during the first year at the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine and Animal Sciences at the University of Peradeniya. She introduced us to amino acids – the foundation of life. Yet, unbeknown to her, by example, she also introduced us to the foundations of a life worth living:seamless kindness, empathy, generosity, humility, joy and the love of adventure.
Accomplished yet humble, helpful yet unassuming, simple, righteous, caring, and down-to-earth – she had it all.
She represented ‘the good’ as we know it, as defined by any religion. “We live in deeds, not years; in thoughts, not breaths....” – as such, she lived her life to the fullest.Yet, in truth, it offers little reparation for the gaping void in those she left behind.
The role Dr. Horadagoda played in our lives extended far beyond any job description of a university lecturer.
I will always gratefully remember the time she accompanied me to the hospital in her own vehicle as I was preparing for my Final Year examination and had fallen ill. Similarly, when my best friend was admitted to the ICU, she sat with us on a hospital bench until past midnight until the critical hours passed.
She even brought freshly laundered towels from home. These are, by no means, isolated incidents as each student had their own story to relate as to how she had helped them at some point in their lives.
I have admired not only Dr. Horadagoda's altruism but also her courage and conviction in helping people through numerous situations.
Her kindness transcended people of all walks of life. She saw no boundaries. It did not matter what you were. Or what you weren’t. For her, any individual was first and foremost a human being; and they were fallible. She seemed silently determined that no one deserved to be isolated irrespective of controversy, political correctness or popular view.
Her exuberant personality came through even in the lecture hall. Interesting examples often brought to life the most mundane of topics, making them memorable to us, to this day. Her remarkable ability to remember (quite literally) all our names (and our nick names too) meant that we could not dodge her questions or skip practical classes. If she noticed us catching a quick snooze during an after-lunch lecture, we were all good-naturedly put through a couple of minutes of stretches.
In spite of the many academic accolades and positions of responsibility she held, Dr. Horadagoda remained very much an 'undergrad’ at heart. She enjoyed the company of students and was even happy to play cupid for a number of blossoming romances. On educational excursions she was as delighted as the students to make an unscheduled dip in a random roadside brook - fully clothed in day attire.
On such an occasion I was partnered with her in an impromptu water-polo match that was played with a coconut husk where I was left defending a highly competitive player.
On her last day at Peradeniya before leaving for Australia in 2002, a long line of students patiently queued at the Faculty Biochemistry building to bid her good bye - Veterinary students and others; seniors and juniors; Tamils, Muslims and Sinhalese; the toffs and the union leaders - they were all there, I too amongst them.
To this day I am amazed to have witnessed such a scene - a rare occurrence no doubt in a university setting. Inside the building, Dr. Horadagoda stood at the centre of the hall as grateful students fell at her feet, one by one. She hugged them all and at times ruffled their hair fondly as one would do to a young child.
Perhaps to her, all these strapping men and young women symbolised just that - children in the wider context of society. She took us under her wing, batch by batch, and watched us over – like a mother would do. I am one amongst hundreds that she fondly referred to as ‘Mage lamai’ – her brood of adopted kids from Peradeniya that mourns her absence today.
I've known Dr. Horadagoda for almost 20 years. Even after she left for Australia she kept in touch with me as she did with many of her other students who were scattered across the continents. She followed us closely and was proud of our achievements but was quick to reach out and comfort us at times the unexpected happened and our worlds crumbled for various reasons, as they occasionally did.
With her endearing smile she graciously shared our burden, offering us gentle reassurances.
Today too our world has crumbled once again and we silently mourn the parting of an inspiring teacher, a true friend, and an exceptional human being. If you believed in angels on earth, to the many students at Peradeniya, she was one of them.
I will think of her often, fondly, and with profound gratitude, for I amongst many others were truly privileged to have known her. "When you are sorrowful look again in your heart, and you shall see that in truth, you are weeping for that which has been your delight” - Kahlil Gibran
My dearest teacher, may you attain the Supreme Bliss of Nibbana!
