The opposite of President’s UN remark will happen: Bhikshu Forum


	

Referring to the recent remark made by President Maithripala Sirisena at the United Nations (UN) General Assembly, the National Academic Bhikshu Forum (NABF) today said something would happen exactly to the opposite of what President Sirisena had claimed before the international community.

President Sirisena on Tuesday called on the international community to allow Sri Lankan people to solve their problems on their own as being an independent country.

NABF Convener Prof. Ven. Maduruoye Dhammissara Thera told a news conference that there was no credibility in the statements made by President Sirisena and added he had made similar claims even before which were of no use.

“President Sirisena has guaranteed us that he would not let any authority to implement laws against soldiers. However, such laws were implemented soon after President Sirisena’s guarantee of not doing so,” the Thera said.

“President Sirisena has also guaranteed that he would not proceed with the proposed 20th Amendment to the Constitution. However, the background has already been established to proceed with it,” the Thera added.

The Thera said accordingly something opposite would occur in future rather solving country’s problems in our own without the interference of international community as claimed by President Sirisena.

Meanwhile, the NABF urged Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to withdraw the proposed 20th Amendment to the Constitution by making a statement in Parliament if he was truly concerned about Buddhism.

Ven. Dhammissara Thera said the proposed 20th Amendment to the Constitution would be detrimental to the country if it would be implemented because it would result in promoting separatism in the country; “There is no need for a new Constitution or Amendment to the prevailing Constitution,” the Thera added.
