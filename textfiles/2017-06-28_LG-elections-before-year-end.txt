The Elections Commission yesterday said the Local Government elections can be held before the year end if technical issues pertaining to the Local Government Election Law are resolved by July this year.

Addressing the media at the Elections Secretariat, Commission's Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya also said that it is technically possible to hold the Provincial Council elections before the Local Government elections.

“Eastern, North Central and Sabaragamuwa PC elections were held in December 2012 and therefore official term of those councils will expire in September and October this year. The Elections Commission has to issue an election notification within seven days after the term expires. Therefore the Commission has to issue the date of the announcement of the elections on October 2,” he said.

Deshapriya said the elections for the Northern, North Central and Sabaragamuwa Provincial Councils could be held by December 10 if these councils term end in August this year.

“The circular on collecting statistics to Local and Provincial Council elections would be issued on July 1. The circular would be issued to collect the information of the State sector officials and government school teachers,” he added.

“Only if the Bill is passed related to resolve the technical issues in the Local Government elections within the month of July, the Local Government elections can be held in October. The two main political parties have come to an agreement on holding the Local Government elections,” he said.

The Elections Commission was prepared to announce the LG elections by the first week of October. (Chaturanga Pradeep)
