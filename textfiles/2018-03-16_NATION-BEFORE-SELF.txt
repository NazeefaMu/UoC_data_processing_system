Muslim Ladies Study Circle achieves another milestone   



The Muslim Ladies Study Circle which recently received a well-deserved praise and recognition for 45 years of dedicated service to the nation is due to mark another milestone.   


The Muslim Ladies Study Circle is a multi-faceted social service organisation which renders service to all communities irrespective of age religion or ethnicity. The activities cover a broad spectrum including poverty alleviation, providing vocational training, assistance in times of national crisis and providing houses to the needy and displaced.   


The Association had been engaged in running a vocational centre in Kahatovita in a rented building for the past 10 years. The rural women in that area responded and took advantage of the services provided. It grew in numbers over the last 10 years. The appeal to construct a new vocational training centre in Kahatovita was responded positively by Alhaj Ellyas Careem a well known phylonthoripist who believed that charity should be done in a constructive manner and designed to make the recipient self-supportive and not dependent on hand outs as more often it’s the women who bears the burden of the family expenses.   


He stepped in and has constructed a magnificent building covering 16000sqft with all the necessary amenities provided for the numerous training courses such as Cake Icing, Bakery, Cookery, Dress-making, Computer, Thajweed, Beauty Culture, Curtain Stitching and Spoken English . This building will assist the association in covering wide areas such as Udugoda, Thihari, Pasyala, Attanagalla, Pugoda, Kal-eliya, Algama and Orchadwatte.   


The current President of the MLSC is Sikhamani Ameena Faisz Musthapha. The Muslim Ladies Study Circle was founded in Galle and expanded rapidly and established a head quarters in Colombo. Over the last 45 years it has proved to be a well organised and dedicated organisation consisting mainly of housewives. Their dedication has resulted in charity and social service being structured in enhancing the skills of disadvantaged women and enabling them to stand on their own feet.   


The primary target is to empower needy women in rural areas.The MLSC is presently providing Vocationa Training in areas such as Colombo, Galle, Panadura, Weligama and Kahatovita. We hope to branch into other areas as well.
