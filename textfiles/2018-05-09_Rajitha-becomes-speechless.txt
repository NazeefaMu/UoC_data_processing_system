Cabinet spokesman and Minister of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine, Rajitha Senaratne became speechless during a news briefing held yesterday when a journalist asked about the appointment of Anuruddha Polgampola as the new Chairman of State Timber Corporation who had been arrested over two alleged major financial frauds during the past. 

Journalist: What is your stance on the President’s appointment of Anuruddha Polgampola as the new Chairman of State Timber Corporation who had been arrested over two major financial frauds earlier?

Minister: Anuruddha Polgampola was the one who went to Bribery Commission to lodge a complaint against me.

Journalist: Is this your Good Governance to give him such a post merely because he was so active during the Local Government elections and supporting the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP).

Minister: Normally, such helpful persons are the ones who are appointed to such posts.

Journalist: Your government is boasting that the portfolios are given according to scientific basis. Has any scientific basis been used to this appointment. 

Minister: Even those who were appointed under the scientific basis have been caught and arrested. 

Meanwhile, Minister Thalatha Atukorale who also participated in the news briefing was seen gesturing to the journalist who asked the questions stating that it is getting late. “Parakku Wenawa”.  ( Sheain Fernandopulle)
