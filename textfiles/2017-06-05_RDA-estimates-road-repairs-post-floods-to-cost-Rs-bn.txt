The Road Development Authority (RDA) has estimated that it will have to spend as much as eight billion rupees to repair the roads damaged in the floods, officials said.

RDA Chairman N. R, Sooriyarachchi told Daily Mirror that this estimate included the damage caused to A and B Grade highways coming under its purview.“We will need about eight billion rupees for the reconstruction of damaged stretches of highway. This is what is needed to build slope protections,” he said.

He added that the National Building Research Organization (NBRO) had been entrusted with the task of identifying vulnerable areas that needed immediate attention.(Kelum Bandara)
