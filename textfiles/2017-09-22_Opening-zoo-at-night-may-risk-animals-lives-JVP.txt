Opening zoo at night may risk animals' lives: JVP


	

JVP MP Bimal Ratnayake asked yesterday whether a scientific study had been carried out to assess the impact on animals due to the opening of the Dehiwala Zoo at night.

He told Parliament that animals need rest at night and added that keeping the zoo open at night may risk the lives of the animals.

"This is a serious matter. The animals may die,” he said.

Mr. Ratnayake speaking at the debate on Sri Lanka's sustainable Development Bill said a zoo which was kept open at nights in England was renting it for late night parties to raise income.

He added that the Dehiwala Zoo also may have to be rented out to cover the extra expenses.

He said the impact report on animals should be presented in Parliament.

Wildlife Minister Gamini Jayawickrama Perera said he had the experts' reports on the matter and added that they had revealed that there would be no impact on the animals by keeping the zoo open at night. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)
