Nepal’s last ‘dancing bear’ – free at last


	

19 year old Rangila, the last known dancing bear in Nepal has finally been relocated to his new home in India, after a long 30 hour journey. At Wildlife SOS Sanctuary near Agra, he will now be able to lead out the rest of his days in peace and comfort.

Although it’s expected it will take him some time to get over the psychologic stress of his life up until this point, he’s in good physical health, despite the years of abuse he suffered being made to perform for people. Staff of the Jane Goodall Institute, Nepal were responsible for negotiating the rescue with the Nepalese Government and they couldn’t be happier that he’s now in his new home – for good.
