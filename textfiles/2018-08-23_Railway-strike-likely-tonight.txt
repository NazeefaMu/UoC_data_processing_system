Railway strike likely tonight


	

The Railway Technical Services Trade Union Committee (RTSTUC) warned today that they might stop work from tonight because the discussions with the President had not produced any favourable result.

Union’s Secretary Kamal Pieris told Daily Mirror that they had met President Maithripala Sirisena this morning at the Presidents Secretariat.

“The President told us to be patient for two months until the Sarath Amunugama ministerial committee submitted its report,” Mr Pieris said. “We are disappointed and will hold another union meeting this evening to discuss our options and a likely decision will be a further work stoppage from tonight.”

The union had decided to call off the strike following a discussion with the President on August 12.

Railway Trade Unions launched a sudden strike earlier over several issues, including salary anomalies. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)
