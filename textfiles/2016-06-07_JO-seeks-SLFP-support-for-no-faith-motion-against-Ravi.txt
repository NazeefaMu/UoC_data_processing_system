The joint opposition said today they would have discussions with ministers, deputy ministers and state ministers of the SLFP to garner their support for the no-confidence motion against Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake to be taken up in Parliament tomorrow.

MP Bandula Gunawardane said the SLFP ministers, deputy ministers and state ministers who promised to safeguard the rights of the people before the election, should support the no-confidence motion if they are really opposed to the people being burdened.

He said Minister Karunanayke has been found to be the most unsuccessful Finance Minister ever and the JO would reveal in parliament how he has burdened the people.

He said the Finance Minister had created a record by obtaining the highest number of foreign loans totaling up to US$ billion 6.6 at the highest rate of interest since independence. (Ajith Siriwardana)
