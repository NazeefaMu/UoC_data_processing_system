Several seniors in the Green party are about to be elevated to the Assistant Leader level, they say.

 


Three stalwarts, one each from the South, Uva and the West have been already selected and appointing them is said to be a mere formality.  However, the name of a senior from the upcountry who had been among those initially short-listed has been dropped and this worthy has gone highly upset over this, they say. Meanwhile, inside sources say that the objection raised by a peer holding high secretarial status in the party led to striking off the upcountry one’s name. However, there is some comforting news awaiting the upcountry one who by the way is already holding a high position in the council, they say.
