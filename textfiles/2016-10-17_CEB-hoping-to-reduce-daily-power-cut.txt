The Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) hopes to reduce the time period of three-and-a-half hour daily power cut after the Mahaweli Authority had agreed to release more water to the hydro power plants, sources close to Power and Renewable Energy Ministry said today.

The CEB had earlier decided to impose a three-and-a-half hour power cut daily till Friday (21) with effect from today because of the breakdown at the Norochcholai Coal Power Plant.
