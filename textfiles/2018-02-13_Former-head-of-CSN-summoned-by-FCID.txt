Former Chairman of the Carlton Sports Network (CSN) Rohan Welivita had been summoned to the Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID) this morning to record a statement.

Speaking to Daily Mirror Mr. Welivita said the FCID had recorded a statement from him for three hours into an incident of selling a CSN property to a state bank.

He said the FCID was probing the incident that CSN had committed a crime by selling the property in violation of a Court order.

However he said CSN had sold the property with the necessary permission of the Court to settle a sum of Rupees 78 million loan which had obtained through a state bank.

“After the CSN license was canceled without any valid reason, it was unable to settle the liabilities it had,” he said.

Mr. Welivita said that he was summoned soon after the Government’s defeat in the Local Government Election.

“This could be an act of revenge,” he said. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
