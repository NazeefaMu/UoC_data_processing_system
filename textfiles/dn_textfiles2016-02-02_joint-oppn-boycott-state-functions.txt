Joint Oppn to boycott state functions

 
Members of the joint opposition in Parliament will boycott all state functions in the future, its leader, Parliamentarian and former Minister Dinesh Gunawardena said.
He said the government's political witch-hunt today has reached its zenith under the guise of the FCID which is an illegal and parallel outfit to the country's judiciary. Addressing a press conference at the Borella N.M. Perera Memorial Hall, Gunawardena said the attempts made by the UNP to usurp the democratic rights of the people an year ago had also come into the open under the government today.
"Some ministers in the present government too had been hauled before the FCID but they shamelessly hung on their ministerial posts for personal gain," he said.
"When we pointed out in Parliament that the FCID was an illegal outfit, the President too said it would never be given validity," Gunawardena said.
