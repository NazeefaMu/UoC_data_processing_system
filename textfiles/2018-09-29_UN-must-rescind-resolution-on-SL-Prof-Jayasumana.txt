UN must rescind resolution on SL: Prof. Jayasumana


	

Rajarata university’s senior lecturer Prof. Channa Jayasumana, who was in Geneva to counter the pro-LTTE Tamil diaspora, urged the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) to rescind Resolution 30/1 on Sri Lanka.

Addressing the council earlier this week, he said the responsibility of Human Rights bodies and mechanisms was to ensure that humans rights were protected.

The professor said the LTTE resorted to terrorism to divide Sri Lanka on ethnic lines and it violated the rights of all communities but unfortunately, human rights champions remained silent.

He said, “Now, these human rights bodies are working overtime to haul Sri Lankan military before international war crimes court. The Resolution 30/1 against us was based on an unsubstantiated OISL report which was full of contradictions and lies. Member states did not have chance to discuss and debate the resolution as Government of Sri Lanka co-sponsored it. The Darusman report which accused Sri Lanka of killing 40,000 civilians had been challenged by the International legal luminaries such as Sir Jeffry Nice and Rodney Dixon QC as well as Lord Naseby on the basis of wartime British High Commission dispatches from Colombo. You cannot ignore the urgent need for revisit the OISL report. Last year in March we submitted a comprehensive report to this council proving beyond any reasonable doubt that the charges leveled against us in the OISL report were all fabricated. Although you acknowledged the receipt you haven't responded to it. In March 2018 we challenged the October 2015 resolution, as it was co-sponsored by an individual without the proper approval. We request this council to discard the 30/1 Geneva Resolution against Sri Lanka.”
