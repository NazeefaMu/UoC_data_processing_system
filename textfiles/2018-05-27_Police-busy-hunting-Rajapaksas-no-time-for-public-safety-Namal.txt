The police had failed to provide the necessary security to the citizens of the country as they were busy hunting Rajapaksa family, MP Namal Rajapaksa said yesterday.

He said the officers do not have the time to curb underworld activities as they always visit Rajapaksa houses looking for ‘Lamborghini’ cars and golden horses.

MP Rajapaksa accused the government for providing security to underworld leader’s at weddings and protecting them without protecting the public.

“The public knows the Government’s failure to navigate the country’s economy and today it had been proven the Government also failed in protecting its own people,” he said. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
