A former purohita of a now-dissolved provincial council has suddenly metamorphosed as a head of a provincial State body responsible for highways, they say.

 


The politico has become a beneficiary of a monthly pay of Rs. 75,000, an official car and several other perks thanks to this new job.


A close kinsman holding a high position in the private staff of a very high political authority has intervened to appoint the politico to the high post, 
they say.
