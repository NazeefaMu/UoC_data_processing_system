A chief purohita said to be having the inside track to the powers that be, recently made a prediction about the imminent comeback to the fold of some JO rebels.

 


He said a talkative JO one from Matara area was about to defect to accept a seat at the top table.
He also claimed that a certain prominent one from Gampaha whom some astrologers had hailed as the possible second in command of the country in the near future was on the way out of his political party. Reacting to the chief purohita’s prediction about the imminent defection of the JO rebel from the South, the member referred to by implication vowed that he would rather face death than think of quitting the JO.
