Vimala Aponso: We miss you dear ammi


	

Our dearest Ammi was called to be with The Lord on November 13th last year. She was a tower of strength to our family and our home would never be the same without her. Someone said that Piachaud Gardens (Kandy) would never be the same without her. We all miss her a lot, but we  know that she is in a better place now.   
She was a tower of strength to Thaththi. They were married for 65 years which is very rare in the present world. Perhaps, she was the most active senior member of the Y.W.C.A, an institute she served for over 60 years. She was felicitated recently at the National Y.W.C.A. I am sure she would have been very happy when Shyami was elected as the National President of the Y.W.C.A. The Kandy Y.W.C.A will miss her too. She attended all Board Meetings and helped the poor and needy.   
We will continue to do what she started. She was very proud of the three of us (Malli, Nangi and me) and our spouses, her 5 grandchildren and 2 great grandchildren. Though her name was Vimala she wanted her great grandchildren to call her ‘Virnukthi’.   
Her love was not restricted to her immediate family and was given to a wide circle of friends and relations. We were surprised at those who came to pay their last respect at her during the funeral. Some spoke to us about the help she had given to them in their lives. We didn’t know most of these people. She was extremely kind and loving to the maids and drivers who served her and she had concern for their families too.  
She loved to entertain people. Her friends and loved ones still talk about the meals she prepared for them and the love and fellowship extended to those who visited her. Born in Panadura to Lambert and Leena Dias, she started schooling at St.John’s, Panadura. She was later boarded at Ladies College. Some of her close friends were the late Venetia De Alwis and Siva Obeysekara.  Her other siblings were her sister the late Iraganie Fernando (nee Dias) and brothers Hekrema, Welakama and the late Maalya Dias. She was a true Christian and radiated love. She was a lover of dogs. I can still remember how she was so sorry when she lost her pet dog ‘Blackie’.  
No one can replace her, but we are sure to meet again someday. We miss you a lot Ammi. May the Angels sing to you in your sleep.

(Shyamalee and Ajith Aponso, your elder son and daughter~
in-Iaw)
