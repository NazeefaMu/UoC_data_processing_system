Police security would be tightened at GCE A/L examination centres and marking centres due to the general elections, Police Spokesman ASP Ruwan Gunasekara said today.
 Speaking to the Daily Mirror, ASP Gunasekara said the Police had decided to deploy more Police officers.
Meanwhile, Former Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam emphasised that no political demonstrations, election propaganda campaigns or distribution of leaflets would be allowed in the vicinities of examination centres.
“Election propaganda rallies using loud speakers and distributing leaflets near GCE A/L examination centres would distract students greatly. It is the responsibility of every political party not to do so,” Mr. Kariyawasam said.
Speaking on the alternations made in the A/L examination time table, he said there would be no exams between August 15 and 22 due to the elections.
He said examination would again begin on August 24.
However, the Grade Five Scholarship Examinations would not be affected due to the elections and will be held on 23 August as scheduled, he said. (Piyumi Fonseka)
