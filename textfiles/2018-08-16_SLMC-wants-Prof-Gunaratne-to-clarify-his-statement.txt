The Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) has called for an explanation from its former chairman Prof. Colvin Gunaratne in connection with the baseless statements he had made against the functioning of the SLMC, the GMOA said today.

GMOA Secretary Haritha Aluthge told a news conference that the SLMC had written to Prof. Gunaratne asking him to clarify the statements he had made to the media.

He said Prof. Gunaratne should do so immediately and pointed out that all the allegations he had levelled were false and baseless.

“He claimed the primary objective of the Medical Ordinance was to safeguard the rights of patients, but however it was catering to the needs of the doctors because of the SLMC’s composition and that 16 out of the 25 members of the SLMC were elected from trade unions of doctors,” Dr. Aluthge said.

“These statements are not true. Prof. Gunaratne has been a member of the SLMC for many years, even before his appointment as its chairman. However, he kept silent all these years despite having had the opportunity to correct whatever shortcomings if any,” he said.

Meanwhile, GMOA Assistant Secretary Naveen de Soyza asked why there was a delay in appointing a new chairman for the SLMC even though the resignation of Prof. Gunaratne had been approved. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)
