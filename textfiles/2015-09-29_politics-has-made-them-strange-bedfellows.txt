Politics has made them strange bedfellows!


	


There are four well-known siblings, all products of a leading school in the city. They all shone in the gentleman’s game before taking to the game where even gentlemen eventually turn ungentlemanly.
The foursome took four separate ways to politics. They entered the fray at the last general poll and two of them made it to Diyawanna. Of them one is a Ministerial one and the other one a back-bencher, a comedown for him from a high office.
A ceremony was held the other day at the school where the foursome studied to felicitate an illustrious coach of the gentleman’s game and the mother of the four siblings, a former teacher of the same school too attended this ceremony. 
The four siblings seated next to each other in the same row in the audience were the cynosure of all eyes at this ceremony. O! Not for the reason you may have immediately guessed! 
The four siblings were looking straight even without making a casual glance sideways. Right from the start of the function up to its conclusion not a word or a smile passed between them either! 
Politics had turned them into strange bedfellows!
