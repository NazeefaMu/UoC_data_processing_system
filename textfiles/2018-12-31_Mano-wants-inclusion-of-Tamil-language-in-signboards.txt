Minister of National Integration, Official Languages and Social Progress Mano Ganesan requested the Chinese Embassy in Sri Lanka to ensure the inclusion of Tamil language in signboards erected at Chinese funded development projects. He said the signboards had been written in Chinese, English and Sinhala only.

Minister Ganesan told Daily Mirror that he decided to explain to the officials of Chinese embassy about the languages used on signboards after seeing the signboard of Metro Colombo Solid Waste Project only in Sinhala, Chinese and in English. “This is not the only sign where one or two Sri Lanka languages are missing. I have noticed that there are signboards without Sinhala wordings. Therefore, I decided to explain things to the officials of the Chinese Embassy and tell them that signboards should carry wordings in all three Sri Lankan languages as the Language Act of Sri Lanka.

“We are receiving complaints on signboards at Chinese projects using only Mandarin and English ignoring one of the two local languages,” the Minister added. (Yohan Perera)
