With a view to obtaining further details of the Sri Lanka Central Bank’s bond transaction, the heads of the Bank have been summoned to present themselves before COPE on August 12th.

On several earlier occasions, too, these officials have been summoned by COPE and questioned.

The chairman of COPE, MP Sunil Handunnetti said that, as there were more details relating to the bond transaction that have to be resolved, the heads of the Central Bank had been summoned once again.

A special report on the bond transaction is expected to be presented to Parliament after the investigations are completed. (Sujith Hewa Julige)
