President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe had come to an agreement about the time for a Cabinet reshuffle, United People's Freedom Alliance (UPFA) General Secretary Mahinda Amaraweera said.

While addressing at the weekly SLFP media briefing held yesterday Minister Amaraweera said there would be a definite Cabinet reshuffle.

It would be done at an opportune time by the President. This would be done with a view to expedite the government's forward march, he said.

“During the previous government that came to power in 2010 the Cabinet had been reshuffled within its first year in office. The reshuffle had come within the first three months after a new government came to power in 1994. This is the government which runs more than two years without a cabinet reshuffle,” Minister Amaraweera said.

However, it is good to have a Cabinet reshuffle, he further said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)
