While claiming that it was a big mockery to appoint the Prime Minister, who was the mastermind of the bond scam, as the Law and Order Minister, the National Freedom Front (NFF) leader Wimal Weerawansa said the PM and the President should resign without dragging the country towards anarchy.

Addressing a news briefing, he said the President who proclaimed that he would not engage any culprits to run the government, seemed that he had forgotten what he had uttered during the pre-election period.

“The bond scam that took place in the Central Bank of Sri Lanka is considered to be a massive fraud that ever occurred in South Asia. The master brain of such fraud is now being appointed as the Law and Order Minister by the President. Further, giving the portfolio of Youth Affairs to Sagala Ratnayake is like setting a wolf to guard the chickens,” he said.

Therefore, he asked as to how the county would move forward in this circumstances and urged the President either to rethink of entrusting of portfolios or resign with the Premier. (Sheain Fernandopulle)
