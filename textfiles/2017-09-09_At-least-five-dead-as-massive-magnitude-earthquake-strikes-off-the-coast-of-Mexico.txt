At least five have been killed including two children after a massive 8.1 earthquake struck off the south coast of Mexico triggering a tsunami.  


The earthquake was felt across Mexico, toppling houses and shaking buildings in the country’s capital amid reports tremors were detected as a far away as Austin, Texas - more than 1,300 miles from the epicentre.  


A tsunami has already been detected in Mexico after the quake struck at 11.49pm last night, 76 miles southwest of the town of Pijijiapan, at a depth of 43 miles.  


Terrified residents in Mexico City ran out into the streets after the quake struck, witnesses said. Tremors were stronger than a devastating earthquake in 1985 that hit the capital flattening swathes of the city and killing thousands. The US Tsunami Warning System said widespread hazardous tsunami waves were possible within the next three hours on the Pacific coasts of several central American countries - Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Panama, Ecuador and Honduras.   
Seismologists have warned of a tsunami of more than 12 ft. As far as 8700 miles away in the Philippines, the national disaster agency put the country’s entire eastern seaboard on alert.
