Joint Opposition MP Keheliya Rambukwella said today Speaker Karu Jayasuriya should respectfully resign from his post in connection with the recent fracas in Parliament.

He said they accepted the Speaker’s statement that the turmoil in Parliament was planned and organized because the Prime Minister came with a lengthy statement instead of tabling the PCoI report in parliament.

“It is true that what happened was organized and planned. Party leaders had agreed at their meeting to table the PCoI report. It was the only business in the order paper of the day. But the Speaker informed us that he had not received the report and it was then that the Prime Minister started making a lengthy statement. Who planned it? Was the speaker unaware of the Prime minister’s speech,” the MP asked.

He claimed that the Prime Minister threatened the speaker and asked him for the mike and added that the Speaker should go home respectfully over this incident.

The MP said the Prime Minister threatened the speaker saying ‘Give me the mike. Otherwise I will remove you from there,’ then the speaker gave the mike to the PM.

“We feel sorry and ashamed at what happened to the speaker. He should go home respectfully,” he said. (Ajith Siriwardana)
