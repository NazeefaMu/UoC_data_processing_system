Responding to a statement made by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa that President Maithripala Sirisena brought him back to politics, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinge on Saturday said that Mr Rajapaksa would have gracefully retired after two terms if he did not amend the constitution enabling him to go for another term.

Prime minister made this remark at rally organized by the UNP in Anurhapura on Saturday.

"Former President had said that President Siriaena brought him back to politics after retirement. I don't want to talk about SLFP but would like to say that late President J R Jayewardene in his constitution limited the number of terms a president could hold to two. Accordingly he retired after serving two terms. President Wijetunge retired after serving one term and President Chandrika Kumaratunga retired after two terms. However, President Rajapaksa amended the constitution and decided to go for a third term. He would have retired gracefully without getting defeated if he did not run for a third term." the Prime minister said.(Yohan Perera)
