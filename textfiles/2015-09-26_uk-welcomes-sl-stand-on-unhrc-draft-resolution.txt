The UK government has welcomed the stand taken by Sri Lanka on the draft resolution submitted to the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) in Geneva.
UK Minister of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office Hugo Swire said that Sri Lanka’s cooperation on the resolution is another step closer to addressing the legacy of the conflict.
The draft resolution on Sri Lanka was submitted to the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) yesterday with several amendments to the original text proposed earlier in the week.
The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and United States of America have co-sponsored the resolution which was officially submitted to the 30th session of the UNHRC in Geneva.
