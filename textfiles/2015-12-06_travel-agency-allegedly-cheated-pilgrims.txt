The Police Fraud Investigation Bureau has commenced an inquiry into a case where over one hundred local pilgrims who went on a pilgrimage to India were allegedly deceived by the travel agency that sent them.
Fraud Bureau officials had recorded the statements of over a hundred pilgrims at the Bandaranaike International Airport, on their return from India last evening.
Police Spokesman ASP Ruwan Gunasekara said the officials had begun a probe into possible criminal breach of trust, following a complaint lodged by the family members of the pilgrims.
He said the pilgrims had informed their families in Sri Lanka that the agency that had promised to take them on a tour of several sites of religious significance to Buddhists -- in North India -- but had omitted several important ones.
The agency had also charged them extra for various items after they arrived in India, though these had been included in the package deal.
The ASP said the pilgrims had reportedly faced many difficulties during their pilgrimage -- at Bodh Gaya and other places in Bihar. (Kurulu Koojana Kariyakarawana)
