Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) Secretary Mohan De Silva said it was Malinga who wanted to return to the country saying he was not 100 percent fit.

He said the team management had noticed Malinga’s poor physical fitness during yesterday’s training session.
Mr. De Silva said Malinga had returned to the country and that a suitable replacement would be sent soon.

He rejected the statement made by Malinga that he was sent to India despite his recent recovery for a knee journey.

“His allegation is absolutely false. He sent us a mail saying he was stepping down from the captaincy due to his knee injury and but would be playing in the tournament if he is selected. He informed us that even though he was unable to go to India on March 8 with the other team members, he will go on March 15 after the treatment for the injury is completed. We did not send him without his consent,” De Silva said. (Piyumi Fonseka)
