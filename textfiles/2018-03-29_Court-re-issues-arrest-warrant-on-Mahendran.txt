The Colombo Fort Magistrate’s Court today re-issued an arrest warrant on former Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran as the prosecution is currently working on getting the red notices from Interpol.

The first arrest warrant was issued on March 15 because Mr. Mahendran failed to turn up to the CID inquiry over the Central Bank bond scam. (SCS)
