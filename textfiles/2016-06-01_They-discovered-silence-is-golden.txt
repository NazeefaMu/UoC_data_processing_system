Stories are galore about how political bigwigs who were going round the flood-hit areas to direct the relief aid distribution rather late in the day had had to face the wrath of the flood victims.

 


It was in the Wellampitiya area that most politicos had to face a hostile reception from flood victims.  
A chief purohita and a team member from the yahapalanaya top table who visited this area too had to face an unforgettable and embarrassing incident. 


A large crowd of flood victims had mobbed the purohita duo soon after they showed up in Wellampitiya, not in a gesture of a warm welcome but to berate them for visiting them when the worst was over.  “We were struggling mired in flood waters for several days, but you people did not care to send boats to save our lives. Our lives were saved by our own people in the area who deployed hired boats in a quick rescue operation. You visit us now having ignored us at the most critical hour,” they told the two VIPs. The two bigwigs had patiently listened to their angry comments and jibes making no move that could further provoke them. Therefore, they could leave the area without suffering any outrage.   


However, a certain Diyawanna member who had to face a similar situation while distributing relief material in the Gampaha area had not taken kindly to the angry protests of the flood victims.  The henchmen who accompanied the Diyawanna member had brandished their fists even at the womenfolk and a serious clash which was about to break out had been averted at the nick of time, they say.
