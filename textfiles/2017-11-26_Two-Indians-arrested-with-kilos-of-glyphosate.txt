The Navy said an inshore patrol craft attached to the North Central Naval Command, who intercepted an Indian fishing dhow in Sri Lankan territorial waters had recovered the glyphosate consignment along with the two Indians, when they attempted to smuggle glyphosate into Sri Lanka via sea in the guise of fishermen.

The suspects, the consignment of glyphosate, the fishing dhow and other equipment were handed over to the Mannar Police for onward legal action.
