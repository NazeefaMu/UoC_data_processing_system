P. Kumarage on August 22.

“Although the Basnayake Nilame could not participate in the discussions, we will let him know the outcome of the meeting and hope he would agree with the decisions taken at the meeting,” he added.

Meanwhile, the chief Kapu Mahattaya, Somipala Ratnayake admitted that the issue had been concluded with pertinent solutions and adding that they did not bother the absence of the Basnayake Nilame at the meeting.
