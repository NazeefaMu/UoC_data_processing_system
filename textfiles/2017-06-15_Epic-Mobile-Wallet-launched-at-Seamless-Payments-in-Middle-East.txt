This innovative product is the world’s first ever single application for payer and payee bringing together all CASA accounts, debit and credit cards into one common platform. What is more, it also facilitates merchants to accept payments in different modes such as via NFC, dynamic and static QR codes as we well as time and event-based tokens.”
Mudalige further went on to state “The Epic Mobile Wallet uses multiple authentication techniques in the form of face recognition, finger print and voice recognition giving users multiple authentication mechanisms. All these embedded features make it a truly distinctive product in the market.”
“When we created this unique product our main objective was to deliver a user friendly digital lifestyle solution which would enable our  customers to share their bills by splitting between wallet users, send and receive money, initiate  card less transactions, enable wallet top ups with their CASA accounts, make loan requests, etc. just to name a few”. “We also looked at the untapped merchant market taking into account terminalized merchants (NFC and mobile number based payments), non terminalized merchants (those using dynamic QR code) and finally grass root level merchants (using static QR code) because we want this product to cater to all segments within the socioeconomic pyramid,” concluded Mudalige.
