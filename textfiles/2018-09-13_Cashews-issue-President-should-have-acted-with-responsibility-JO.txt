The Joint Opposition (JO) today said President Maithripala Sirisena should have acted in a more responsible manner when dealing with the incident where he was treated with cashews unsuitable for consumption during his recent trip with Sri Lankan Airlines.

JO MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage told a news conference that the Sri Lankan Airlines may run into huge loss because of President Sirisena’s controversial statement since it was also reported through international media.

“We regret the fact that President Sirisena has made such a statement regarding the national airline service in the country. President Sirisena should have informed the management or relevant authorities over this issue if those cashews were not fit to consume,” he said.

“This statement will have a negative impact on the Sri Lankan Airlines business activities. As the President, it would have been better if President Sirisena could have talked in a more responsible manner,” he added. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)
