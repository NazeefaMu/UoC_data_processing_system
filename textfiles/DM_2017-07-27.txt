CPC strike at a time of national crisis: PM
	
The Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) trade unions have stopped work at a time the country is facing a critical situation when the government and others are making a joint effort to curb the spread of dengue, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe told Parliament yesterday.
Even the media has stopped competing with each other to fight the spread of dengue, as the time has come for everyone to play a role to fulfil their duty to the nation," he said. Several important services such as the health service including the transport of hospital staff, operation of ambulances, power generation in hospitals and the public transport sector will be disrupted if the fuel distribution comes to a standstill."
The Prime Minister said the security forces would be involved in safeguarding the fuel storage tanks and the access roads to those locations as soon as the gazette notification to declare fuel distribution as an essential service was issued.
The government received information that there was a move to commit serious acts of sabotage within the CPC premises, while there have been reports of a few minor incidents," he said.
The Prime Minister said fuel distribution had returned to normal and fuel bowsers were leaving the storage points at the time he was making the statement in the House.
The government is committed towards safeguarding democracy and upholding human rights. It respects the law and judiciary. However the government is not prepared to surrender to mischievous elements who are out to disrupt peace and destroy democratic values," he said. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)

CPC strike called off temporarily
	
The indefinite strike launched by the Ceylon Petroleum Cooperation's (CPC) TU Collective was called off last evening to be resumed next Tuesday (1).
An official of the TU Collective said the decision was taken after a discussion held with President Maithripala Sirisena at the Presidents official residence.
We received a positive response from the President during the meeting. He requested us to stop the Trade Union action and to come for another discussion next Tuesday. We agreed to call it off temporarily and give the government time till next Tuesday (1). We have requested our members to return to work, he said.
The work stoppage launched by the CPC employees took a new turn yesterday when the army took over operations at the Kolonnawa and Muthurajawela refineries to restore fuel distribution.
However, within 24-hours, the Army withdrew the additional soldiers deployed after a majority of employees returned to work last evening.
Army Spokesman Roshan Seneviratne said the decision was taken after the employees agreed to carry out their duties without a hitch.
The special teams deployed for the control of the petroleum distribution have been recalled, he said.
The government was quick to issue a warning to the striking trade union employees urging them to return to work immediately. It said any employee who failed to return to work would be considered as having resigned his or her post.
With the army taking over operations, 15 fuel bowsers and a train transporting jet fuel was released from the refineries amid obstruction by striking employees, Brigadier Seneviratne said.
He said the Army had to take overthe fuel distribution last morning after the issuance of the Special Gazette notification which made the supply and distribution of fuel - including Petroleum Products and Gas - an essential service.
The Army entered the Kolonnawa and Muthurajawela refinery premises together with the Police and discussed with the management to obtaining technical support from petroleum officials, Brig. Seneviratne said.
During the strike the protesters had blocked the main entrance to the Kolonnawa refinery with five bowsers with their tyres deflated.
He said those returning to work were prevented from doing so by those on strike.
Meanwhile, Welikada Police said they arrested 16 trade union leaders including CPC Trade Union Collective Media Spokesman Bandula Saman Kumara on charges of obstructing the distribution of fuel and the release of bowsers from the Kolonnawa refinery.
However, the suspects were later released on police bail.
Meanwhile, TU Collective Convener D. J. Rajakaruna said the Army forcibly entered the Kolonnawa and Muthurajawela refinery premises on Tuesday night and took over the distribution of fuel. The Army assaulted the employees and chased them out of the gates, but we have not decided to call off our TU action, he said (Chaturanga Pradeep)

Death toll in Mumbai building collapse rises to 17
	

REUTERS, 26th JULY, 2017- The death toll from the collapse of a four-storey building in the suburbs of Indias financial capital, Mumbai, more than doubled overnight to 17 as rescuers removed debris searching for those still trapped, a police official said on Wednesday.
The 40-year-old building in Mumbais eastern suburb of Ghatkopar housed a nursing home on the ground floor and three to four families on each of the other floors. The building wasnt on the list of dilapidated buildings, Mumbai Mayor Vishwanath Mahadeshwar told reporters on Tuesday. We will investigate whether the building fell because of an alteration in the structure.
Search and rescue operations went on amid sporadic rain showers on Wednesday. There was a hospital at the basement of the building that was conducting renovation work, which could have led to the collapse of the building, Prakash Mehta, housing minister for the western state of Maharashtra, told reporters.

Expect unexpected power cuts: CEB
	
The Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) said today that unexpected power failures could be experienced across the country due to several reasons including a decrease of hydro-power generation.
CEB media spokesman Sulakshana Jayawardana said power failures could occur whenever there is a high electricity demand in a given area.
However, he said the power cuts would not affect areas where there are hospitals.
Commenting on the reasons behind power failures, he said a 300 MW phase at the Norochcholai power plant is yet to be repaired. We are hoping to restore the Norochcholai power plant by the first week of August, Mr. Jayawardana said.
He said several private owned power plants at Embilipitiya (100MW), Pallekale (23MW) and Galle (07MW) were shut down on Wednesday due to a fuel shortage.
Meanwhile, a 110 MW gas turbine plant at Kelanitissa Power Station had tripped today. Due to the prevailing dry weather in most parts of the country, the power generation capacity of the hydropower stations have also been decreased, he said.
He said the CEB was planning to add small power plants to the system in coming days. (By Darshana Sanjeewa)

## Title: Getting (into) Sinhala movies

Getting (into) Sinhala movies
	

In handling a camera I feel that I have no peer. But what De Sica can do, I cant do. I ran his Shoeshine again recently and the camera disappeared, the screen disappeared; it was just life...(Orson Welles)

One Friday night, not too long ago, I switched on the TV for no reason whatsoever. I went on pressing the remote until I came across a channel which telecast Sinhala movies every week. This time around, they were screening something that had been shown 15 years ago, which they (wrongly) thought was being shown for the first time on local television. I was 10 when I saw it last, but even at that age it left such an impression on me that I could remember almost every shot and how it would end. 
They started screening it at 10.30. At about 11.30 I read a message from a young man inviting me to watch and review an event organised by a society at his school the following week at the Lionel Wendt. I was more interested in what was being screened, so I texted him excitedly, Tune into XYZ TV, theres a lovely Sinhala film on. Feeling rather perturbed at my own haste (because who sends messages like that to young people anymore), however, I added, Count me in for next weeks show! By then the story had entered its second half, emotionally the most difficult to wade through. I laid aside the phone for about five minutes, and then took it back. 
This young man had messaged me. Expressing delight at the fact that I would come to and write on his Societys event, he replied to my earlier missive: I am not into Sinhala films. Dont get them. Numbed, I asked, What about Sinhala novels He fired back: Not really. Im not that fluent in Sinhalese. 
The reply, and the conversation that preceded it, almost deadened me.
I watched the remainder of the story, well past midnight, remembering what was to come and how it was to end. I had wept at it before. I wept at it again.
As the credits rolled and Amaradevas music soared so high, my spirits couldnt keep up, I remembered that young man and his casual dismissal of our movies, and I wept harder. It seemed as though sorrow had kissed me that night: I cried all the way to my dreams, tears streaming on to my pillow, and woke up the following morning, still sobbing. 
When people say they dont get Sinhala movies, they arent thinking of how fluent or inarticulate they are in their mother tongue. Rather, they are thinking about their incapacity to digest a particular type of film in narrative terms. The young have given up on our cinema, because the best in our cinema escape them. They see the worst and think that the best are no different to the worst. 

No. Theyre put off because they cant digest the possibility that our cinema can breed good stories, the same kind of stories they get from Lucas, Spielberg, and Bay.



Our movie industry was birthed by a set of people who didnt know how to make movies. They were storytellers and mythmakers at best, who had earlier lived off the theatre. From the theatrical thrust of the Jayamanne brothers to the idealism of Lester James Peries to the anti-idealism of Dharmasena Pathiraja to the independent cinema of Prasanna Vithanage, Asoka Handagama, and Vimukthi Jayasundera, consequently, the divide between what was arty and what was commercial remained. So much so that today, the likes of that young man only get to see the latter. Not the former. And even if they do see the former, they will see what they dislike there too. 
The truth then is that our mainstream directors dont know how to tell a story anymore. Even the kitschiest moviemakers from the past  Robin Tampoe, K. A. W. Perera, Neil Rupasinghe, Daya Wimalaweera, and Yasapalitha Nanayakkara knew how to transform the unreality of the experience in their work to the emotions and gestures they got from their audiences. At one level this was class bound; the same middle class that cried at Janaka saha Manju when it was first released laugh at it now, while the lower classes continue to weep over its contrived plot.
 
A well read neighbour of mine shocked me the other day by swearing (as though it were the gospel truth) that Janaka saha Manju was the saddest love story hed ever seen.
That other young man, by contrast, was involved with his schools English Literary Society, debates in English, and comes from a conservative upper middle class background. If we are to extract a metaphor from this, the prince disparages even the best of ours, while the pauper fawns on whats taken by the prince as the worst.
 
I have unfortunately been writing about the best and the worst and the pedestrian without assigning any value to them. For me, and I daresay for most discerning youngsters today, the best movies are those that dont compel analysis, that seem so well oiled that no interpretation is necessary. The middle-class youngsters of today, for instance, know that Michael Bay is not great, just as they know that Wes Anderson is greater in aesthetic terms. But they are pulled more by narrative power than by aesthetics, which explains that at times inexplicable box-office dividends reaped by Armageddon, Pearl Harbour, and the Transformers franchise. 
The best works of Lester James Peries  Gamperaliya, Golu Hadawatha, and Akkara Paha  told a story aimed at enthralling a common denominator. These were movies that breathed naturally, without the aid of technique. Lesters most intellectual work Delovak Athara, on the other hand, was made for academic study, while Nidhanaya occupied a twilight world between Edgar Allan Poe and Freuds couch (as I implied in last weeks article). By contrast, Golu Hadawatha and Akkara Paha  the first and second in a trilogy that Lester made for Ceylon Theatres  are so vividly realised that all they do is fascinate us. Like what De Sicas Shoeshine was to Orson Welles, in them the camera and the screen disappear; what comes out is life itself. 
That movie I watched after 15 years, which got me to understand the existential dread felt by our young men towards our cinema, ranks alongside the best on that count. Sagara Jalaya Madi Handuva Oba Sanda remains the true masterpiece of Lesters wife, Sumitra.

When people say they dont get Sinhala movies, they arent thinking of how fluent or inarticulate they are in their mother tongue

It also remains an almost perfectly conceived movie, a point which escaped that young man because he equated every movie made here with the comedies of Roy de Silva (which even I dont get).
Sumitras movie suggests the beauty and poignancy of living, in a world far removed from ours (its set in the North Central Province, near the Wanni). It points out that a work of art, allowed to breathe naturally, can become timeless. How can one not get it 
The young men of this country arent put off by Sinhala movies because they arent conversant in Sinhala. If that were the case, I wouldnt be writing this, because my fluency in the mother tongue is pedestrian at best, definitely more pedestrian than that of the young man I talked with. No. Theyre put off because they cant digest the possibility that our cinema can breed good stories, the same kind of stories they get from Lucas, Spielberg, and Bay. And because they cant digest, they refuse to watch.
I dont think they are to blame, frankly. The fact is that we were once moved by stories. Stories in the cinema. When our movies lost their narrative touch, when directors began to hanker after awards and agencies and everything else paraded in the name of Art, they lost touch with you and me, the common cinemagoer. When that happens, inevitably, we lose our interest in our industry. And when we, the common cinemagoers, lose interest, the best our industry can do is to survive on those same awards and agencies and High Artiness that we repudiated. In effect, getting into Sinhala movies has become hard, difficult, at times even impossible.

I went to Oxford because  I knew Pali - Dr. Yojana Bhagat
	
Dr. Yojana Bhagat, a leading Indian scholar of Pali, in an interview with the Daily Mirror spoke about the importance of this language and its literature as an interdisciplinary subject to research into different areas of study. Dr. Bhagat, the Coordinator and Assistant Professor attached to the Department of Pali at Mumbai University, was in Sri Lanka recently. The following are excerpts of the interview.

Pali is now an international language
	It offers research components in many disciplines
	Buddha Dhamma has answers to all questions
	Not only monks, but also lay students should be encouraged to learn it
	Pali literature has ancient medicine, architecture, management, economics etc
	Pali is studied in the western world
	Pali words shouldnt be translated into other languages
	It has words with varying meanings depending on contexts
	Pali gave birth to many languages including Sinhala
	Its not just the language of Buddhism
	Its not necessary that you speak the language

How do you view the importance of the Pali language as its no longer a spoken language
Pali is not a dead language. It is very much live. People dont speak it in daily life. But, its very much an international language. Its studied all over the world. A lot of research is being carried out regarding the language. Its not just the language of Buddhism. It contains the teachings of the Buddha. If you learn the Tripitaka, it has answers to all the questions one has. There is an answer to any question you ask. It has answers to the questions why; you are born, dead, angry, sad etc. Another feature is that it has many things that provide for interdisciplinary research. In Pali literature, you have ancient medicine, architecture and the best of psychology. Modern psychology isnt up to the mark compared to what the Buddha taught. You have all the practices in meditation. You have management skills, law and administration. All these are there. Its not that the Buddha taught these things in specific terms. But, you can extract from his teachings to know all about these. You have to study the original form of the languae. That is why Pali literature is so important. You have to study the original language, not translated versions. Its because the Pali words have different connotations in varying contexts. If you take the word Dhamma it refers to the Buddhas teaching in one context. If you say Dhammanussati, it is thought. When you talk about Dhamma, it changes meanings depending on the context. If you know the exact meaning and exact reference, then only you get the right meaning. The word doctrine is not the English equivalent of Dhamma all the time. Earlier, people used to use the words lord for Buddha, congregation for Sangha. That is not true. Now these words are not translated. The Buddha is the Buddha, Dhamma is Dhamma. We cannot find equivalents in other languages for these words.


But the cultural aspect of Buddhism is important. Its found in Sri Lanka. That is the purpose of our visit. We dont know how to conduct Bodhi Pooja or to offer alms

How is it possible to make it a more live language and make people communicate with it
In my opinion, what is there in that language is more important than speaking with it. Its not necessary that you speak the language. If you start speaking the language, you have to use daily words like car, telephone. These words are not there in Pali. Then, you have to coin some new words for these. In Pali, it doesnt make any sense. It has the teachings that have to be kept pure. 

How do you analyze the importance of Pali for Sri Lanka because it contributed to the birth and development of the Sinhala Language
It is very important. It is the Mother to many languages, not only to Sinhala. Even in India, all the languages originated from Prakrit. Prakrit is the original language. One of its spoken forms was Pali. It was a spoken language. In India, there were Prakrit and Sanskrit. Sanskrit is a formed, designed language spoken by the elite people like Brahmins at that time. Pali was the spoken language of all the people. The Buddha spoke in that language. In all Indian languages like Gujarati, Marati and Bengali, you have Pali. If you learn Pali in reference to your regional language, it will be very easy. 

According to your observations, how keen are students on learning this language in India and the rest of the word
In India, we are developing. At the University of Bombay, we are inspiring students to learn Pali and do interdisciplinary researches. That is to obtain new knowledge. If a doctor wants to research into ancient medicinal practices taught by the Buddha, then, he can undertake it by learning Pali and develop something new in the field. I have management students studying Pali. They study Jataka stories related to the Buddhas teaching to extract management aspects. One can study architecture in Pali. Then, one can understand why Stupas were built. We can know why it was called Cetiya. We can know what a Pirivena is, how a monk should stay in a room and how big the room should be. The Buddha taught all these things. The Buddha is very clear about even how your room should be.


How are you going to cooperate with the Sri Lankan Universities towards the development
of this discipline
In India, we dont have a Buddhist culture as such. Students are learning Pali as an interdisciplinary subject. But the cultural aspect of Buddhism is important. Its found in Sri Lanka. That is the purpose of our visit. We dont know how to conduct Bodhi Pooja or to offer alms. We are trying to revise that in India, especially at the University of Mumbai. 

How do you view the musical sounds of thePali language
Now, we talk about recitations. When we chant, its about how to memorize things. The Buddha has taught in such a manner that these can be memorized very easily. It was an oral tradition. When Arahat Mahinda Thera came from India, he brought it in oral form. To remember the oral things, the Buddha has given stanzas in such a beautiful way. The Buddha was a great teacher. He taught in such a way that people sitting in front not only remember things, but also understand. While teaching only, he got others to repeat things twice or thrice. Then, he would ask questions. Persons sitting in front were also involved in the learning process. He was a great teacher. Recitations were always like it. The Buddha possessed the greatest techniques of teaching. 
Here, I am told that students dont like to learn Pali because they dont find jobs. I think it shouldnt be the problem. There is a lot of scope for research in Pali. People shouldnt look to India or Sri Lanka only. We have scope outside our countries for Pali. People in other parts of the world look at the Pali literature. The person who knows Pali becomes the authority. I went to Oxford because I knew Pali. They invited me to learn more from them. In Oxford, they have Pali. All the scholars of Pali are westerners. 

I have management students studying Pali. They study Jataka stories related to the Buddhas teaching to extract management aspects

In Germany, they have Pali. The western countries learn Pali. In Sri Lanka, you find German scholars who have written such beautiful books. We are using these books. Bhikkhu Bodhi and Narada Thera are among them. They have done great jobs here.

What is the kind of cooperation you have from other Buddhist countries such as Thailand, Myanmar and Cambodia towards the development of Pali
I have students from Myanmar reading for their doctorates. They dont know English. But, they communicate with me in Pali. Its an international language. They communicate, among other things, how they intend to do research. I think research must to be encouraged here. Then, students can benefit and move to the world outside. For that, a little of English is important. There are so many Sinhala books not translated into English. Mostly monks resort to study Pali, not other students. They have to be encouraged. An example is architects having to study Pali. Doctors have to learn this language. Management students should do so. You have a Buddhist economy. I have economics students doing Buddhist economy. There are lawyers studying Buddhism. All these interdisciplinary aspects are very important. Its also important for your personal growth through meditation.

India arrests Kashmir separatists for terror funding
	
REUTERS, 26th JULY, 2017
Indias federal counter-terrorism agency arrested seven members of Kashmirs main separatist alliance on Monday on charges of receiving funds from Pakistan-based militant groups to wage attacks, the agency said, the first such case against the group. The National Investigation Agency (NIA) said it had found cash and valuables worth millions of rupees, electronic devices and incriminating documents during raids on the seven members of All Parties Hurriyat Conference.
The Hurriyat is an umbrella group of political and religious groups fighting for Kashmirs secession from India.
The accused could not be reached for comment. Top leaders including Syed Ali Shah Geelani, Mirwaiz Umar Farooq and Mohammad Yasin Malik condemned the arrests as arbitrary and called for a strike on Tuesday to protests the action.
Separatist violence and street protests have increased in Kashmir since last year when security forces killed a popular young separatist commander.

NDB June quarter net  profit up 40% on strong loan growth, better margins
	
National Development Bank PLC, the development lender turned commercial bank, reported earnings of Rs.4.48 a share or Rs.748. 1 million for the April -June quarter, recording an increase of 39.7 percent from a year ago as the bank managed to maintain the growth in advances and margins despite difficult market conditions, the interim financial accounts showed.
NDB was the first bank to release results in the second quarter earnings season and for the 1H17 the banking group made a net profit of Rs.1.49 billion or Rs.8.90 a share, increasing from Rs.6.56 a share, which translated to a 37 percent increase from a year ago. The banks Chief Executive Officer, Dimantha Seneviratne in an earnings release said the bank had been able to well maintain the sound growth coming from all sectors, diversifying the core banking income base.
NDB with a total asset base of Rs.365 billion managed to expand its loan book by strong Rs.24 billion or 10.3 percent during the 6 months, virtually doubling its loan growth during 1Q17, which was Rs.13.4 billion.
This was despite the improved quality of assets as the banks gross non-performing loan ratio fell to 2.22 percent from 2.63 percent in December 2016.
This is below the industry average of around 2.9 percent.
However, the bank made provisions of Rs.440.6 million against possible bad loans, majority of which were made against some selected clients. This is an increase of 32.4 percent from the provision made during the same quarter, last year.
Meanwhile, the net interest income (NII) grew by 15.3 percent during the quarter from a year ago to Rs. 2.49 billion as the bank managed to maintain its net interest margin  the spread between the interest yield of its assets and the cost of its funding book  around 2.74 percent, little down from 2.78 percent by the end of the 1Q17.
The bank had a loans and receivables book of Rs.257. 7 billion by end of June.
The banks growing retail focus as well as some aggressive re-pricing of its lending book appears to have helped in maintaining margins.
Meanwhile, the deposits also grew by Rs.35.4 billion or 17.4 percent during the 6 months, out of which Rs.24 billion came during the 1Q17.
NDB now has a deposit base of Rs.239.3 billion. The low cost deposit base, measured by the current and savings account (CASA) ratio remained largely unchanged around 21.9 percent.
The net fee and commission incomes grew by 9.4 percent year-on-year (YoY) to Rs.807.3 million during the quarter. The bank on a standalone basis made a net profit of Rs.1.15 billion for the quarter and Rs. 2.3 billion for the 1H17 recording an increase of 141.7 percent and 81 percent respectively due to some hefty group dividend received during the April  June period as the banking group operates with multiple subsidiaries.
As of June 2017, controversial primary dealer, Perpetual Treasuries had 4.45 percent of the bank being the seventh largest shareholder. Another 2.03 percent stake is held by Perpetual Equities (Private) Limited.
Hence, according to the top 20-shareholder list of NDB, Perpetual group held a 6.48 percent stake, up from 6.17 percent held in December 2016. 
The government held a stake slightly above 30 percent through Bank of Ceylon, Employees Provident Fund and Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation.

## Title: New Army Commander sets out his  scope of work

New Army Commander sets out his  scope of work
	

Sri Lanka Army reached a new milestone in its annals a few days ago when the battle-hardened soldier, Lieutenant General Mahesh Senanayake, took over the reins as the 22nd Commander of the Sri Lanka Army. Respected as an officer par excellence, Nanediri Upendra Mahesh Magilion Weerathunga Senanayake, the fearless Special Forces (SF) warrior, popularly known among his seniors and colleagues as Mahesh,is a symbol of humility and humanity. This doyen of warfare, is now a crusader of reconciliation and peace. He has experienced many vicissitudes and challenges both in his military career and also in personal life. 

I excelled at cadetting and athletics in school
	My father was the guiding light behind my success
	Landmark turning points in his career were the capturing of Mullaittivu and Elephant Pass
	The detractors victimized us stating we were Fonsekas henchmen

EARLY GROOMING
It so happened that our principal, the late Colonel G. W. Rajapakse who possessed an indomitable sense of judgement and foresight, segregated us into different student groups, based on skills and competence at Ananda College. He advised me to toe the military line in the future since I excelled at school cadetting and athletics. These disciplines helped the laying of the very basic foundation for a strict upbringing. Equally corresponding to that choice was my family background. Both my father and the grandfather were Police officers. I looked upon my grandfather with utmost respect as an icon in the family, because he, who had served the then Ceylon Police under British rulers, was a strict disciplinarian,he recalled.

INSPIRING STALWARTS
The new Army Commander reminiscing how his mentors groomed him both at home and in the college, added how his close associates, like Major General (retd) J.C Rambukpotha, Major General (retd) Jagath Dias and others inspired him to be a full-fledged military officer after completion of proper cadetship at Ananda College. 
I finally joined the Army. My father was the guiding light behind my success. He endlessly insisted that I follow the Long Course at the Sri Lanka Military Academy (SLMA), Diyatalawa, instead of the short one.  His unfailing guidance and the support of other directing staff members enabled me to be the 1st in order of merits and the recipient of the most prestigious Sword of Honour at the SLMA graduation, he recalled. 

FIGHTING SPIRIT
He posted out as a 2nd Lieutenant initially in the then 1st Plant Engineer Regiment on 23 June 1983. This was mostly on the insistence of his most respected SLMA instructor, late General Janaka Perera, although he had preferred to join the then Rajarata Rifles Regiment (presently called the Vijayabahu Infantry Regiment).
Lieutenant General Mahesh Senanayake always possessed the fighting spirit as a youthful warrior. Moves were underway around the same time to raise the Armys elite Special Forces (SF), absorbing all SLMA batch tops and the cream of budding officers.  

However, our matured fighting spirits in the SF drew an invigorated fillip soon after Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka in late 2005 took over the command. Fonseka publicly declared that he wouldnt leave the terrorist war to his next successor

The three-month long most-feared dramatic siege on the Jaffna Fort and its subsequent rescue operation, in which the new Commander played a life-threatening role in the invincible Suicide Express squad became proud memories in his career. Some of the landmark turning points in his career were the capturing of Mullaittivu, the Muhamalai battles, the battle of Elephant Pass and the capture of Kalawanchikuddy. He participated in almost all military operations up until May 2009. 

BIRTH OF RADICAL STRATEGIES
To achieve those military gains, admired role model, the late General Denzil Kobbekaduwa gave us the most deserving impetus. He was behind us at different stages of the fight against the LTTE terrorists. The late Generals command, humane qualities, down to earth attitudes, and more significantly the vision he possessed still remain strongly etched in our minds. However, our matured fighting spirits in the SF drew an invigorated fillip soon after Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka in late 2005 took over the command. Fonseka publicly declared that he wouldnt leave the terrorist war to his next successor.
This tilt towards the new radicalized mindset among troops with the birth of LRRP teams brought about a silent revolution within the organization. All dedicated officers, during day and night, began burning midnight oil in search of innovative strategies to overcome the foe, he said. Threat levels in Jaffna and adjoining Muhamalai defences meanwhile were increasing dramatically. The troops were compelled to be on extra vigil during 2005-2007 as the troops were moving northward from the other end. 

VICTIM OF CIRCUMSTANCES
Interestingly, Lieutenant General Mahesh Senanayake in a very pensive mood disclosed the bitter and terrible ordeal that prompted him and 13 of his fellow-Army officers-including 5 most senior Officers- to flee for life in the aftermath of the 2010 Presidential Election. This was after their service, salaries, ranks, housing, pensions and all other facilities, were abruptly denied of overnight at the stroke of a pen. And all of us were instantly discharged, saying service no longer required, without having courtesy to even summon a preliminary Court of Inquiry against us, as has been the laid down practice in the military regulations. The mere reason for this incredibly sad state of affairs happened for the first time in this reputed organization at the behest of those powerful political detractors in that bygone era. The reason the detractors gave to victimize us was stating that we were Fonsekas henchmen, although the truth was otherwise, he said. 
Yes, when our war was reaching a crucial phase, any Commander, for that matter whoever he was, has to work closely with a team of seasoned officers, perhaps at times even with ground-based other rankers directly, whom the decision-makers and commanders, might decide essential for execution of the assigned task. We also had a sound working relationship with the then Commander for execution of our national responsibilities. Was it a wrong move on my part to be faithful to my incumbent Commander he queried.
I also maintained similar working bonds, for example with my immediate predecessor, General Crisanthe De Silva. So, how could one be victimized for that  It was not in my wildest dreams to do or back politics, he said. **Senanayake said that he became a victim of circumstances and certainly not a victim of politics. The highly volatile disposition that prevailed at that period of gloom, chased us, along with our family members into hiding. Our fear-stricken families, accompanying their children, had to be referred afterwards for psychological counselling. In the worst scenario, I was advised to flee the country to escape death, he lamented. 

CURSE TURNS INTO BLESSING
Though life-threatening atrocities perpetrated on us, they in effect worked a disguised blessing to me since my overseas stay in the US afterwards provided me with ample opportunities to further broaden horizons of my knowledge.My findings doubtlessly convinced me how humane and impressively concerned the Sri Lanka Army, were in its approach to dealing with fleeing Tamil civilians and LTTE combatants surrendering. Despite adverse and malicious propaganda, highlighted largely by overseas LTTE sympathizers, our rehabilitation of 12,000 odd LTTE combatants in this regard, was amazing. Those who sweated to make it an unparalleled mechanism, deserve my sincere praise, he said. 

CLOSE RAPPORT WITH JAFFNA PEOPLE
His short but the most productive tenure of office as the Jaffna Commander (January 2016  March 2017), needless to record, won a barrage of plaudits from every layer of Jaffna populace. He relates this achievement to the simple practice of listening to everyone with patience.

Yes, when our war was reaching a crucial phase, any Commander, for that matter whoever he was, has to work closely with a team of seasoned officers, perhaps at times even with ground-based other rankers directly, whom the decision-makers and commanders, might decide essential for execution of the assigned task

A case in point was how he managed to trace the whereabouts of peninsula-based retired Tamil speaking ex-servicemen and ex-Police personnel as high as 105 in number. Some of them appeared feeble in physique and live in isolation, but never dared to reveal their previous career identity to anyone under any circumstances, lest they would be victimized or killed by megalomaniac gunmen. Our protagonist taking a bold step summoned them to his office, formed a friendship association, treated them to a fellow-lunch and distributed gifts among them as appreciative tokens of their service to the country. 

DE-FUSION OF JAFFNA TENSION
You see, a disappointed student should be allowed to articulate his concerns freely as much as he wishes. I sympathized with their radicalized spirit, youthful emotions, anti-Police outbursts, the cause and the objective of protesting en masse. Like us in the South, they disrupted normalcy in the town. In turn, I explained to them their inalienable right for dissent and articulation through their non-violent protests in a democracy. I fully endorsed their radical behaviour, and expressed my sympathy over the accidental deaths, but warned them against outbreak of any cycle of violence or damage to state property in a very appealing manner. They bowed down and the tension was defused, he said. 
Lieutenant General Mahesh Senanayake said, I am glad to state here that no attempt whatsoever had been made to-date, to politically interfere with the Army or its administration after President Maithripala Sirisena and the Prime Minister Ranil Wickrememsinghe were voted into power in 2015, which itself is a healthy development and a must. 

CONCERN FOR IDPs
A monumental tribute to this officer cum gentleman is the miraculously completed housing project in Nallinakkapuram, adjacent to the perimeters of the Palaly Security Force cantonment in Jaffna. Within a record period of 2  months, Security Forces under his command put up those 100 new houses and vested them in the IDPs, adding another feather to his unmatched skills.

NEW VISION
Setting out his new vision for the Army as the 22nd Commander of the Army, Lieutenant General Senanayake didnt want to mince his words. Instead he spoke out his mind. I will continue to be a good listener. Centralized control and de-centralized execution is the need of the hour. Secondly, that mission command encompasses everything. We must remember that the globe is faced with lots of complexities.  
Lieutenant General Senanayake, decorated with the Rana Wickrama Padakkama (RWP) medal for his individual and associated acts of bravery, is a father of two daughters, Iranka Ranasi, a doctor by profession, Suwanka Helasi, an aeronautical engineer, and a son, Siyath. He is happily married to Mrs Chandrika Senanayake.

no transgender people will serve in US military:
	

U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday he would not allow transgender individuals to serve in the U.S. military in any capacity.
After consultation with my Generals and military experts, please be advised that the United States Government will not accept or allow transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military, Trump wrote in a series of Twitter posts.
Our military must be focused on decisive and overwhelming victory and cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail, the Republican president wrote.
The Pentagon ended its ban on openly transgender people serving in the U.S. military in 2016 under Democratic President Barack Obamas administration. It was expected to start allowing transgender people to begin enlisting this year, provided they had been stable in their preferred gender for 18 months.
Last month, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis approved a six-month delay in allowing transgender recruits to join the U.S. armed forces.

Public disgust aimed at government, CPC TUs
	
People were greatly inconvenienced due to the strike carried out by Ceylon Petroleum Cooperation (CPC) Trade Union for the second day yesterday (26).
When Daily Mirror reporters visited several filling stations in Colombo they witnessed lengthy queues with motorists been made to wait for hours to get fuel.
Most of them said that they blamed the government for allowing them to suffer in such a manner; "What is the government doing without taking immediate actions to find a solution to this issue. It is utter nonsense, they said.
One of them explained that he had been waiting in a queue to pump fuel since morning. "I request the government to bring an end to this problem and end this strike. Otherwise, we are the ones who are suffering, not the authorities,
"I have been unable to attend to my duties both at my house and at the company owing to this strike, at the end of the day, we are not earning money but government officials are still making money" another person remarked. (Sheain Fernandopulle)

Right of reply : Blind men and  The Glyphosate Elephant
	
Villagers have had common paddy tracts in the lowlands and consumed their own paddy

Reading the article Glyphosate Weed killer now destroys health in the plantations! in the Features Section of the Daily Mirror of July 18, 2017 by Kalani Kumarasinghe reminds us of the proverbial elephant and the blind men, each superficially touching the subject of glyphosate and making various assumptions and prognostications. 
The sentimental assertions of representatives of three NGOs, Peoples Planning National forum, Movement of Land and Agriculture Reforms and the Peoples Movement of Plantation Lands Right with little or no factual substance on the matter of the ban are ridiculous. There were also the comments of a few others including those of a professor holding extremist views on the matter. He once wrote an article referring to glyphosate as a cobra! This cobra is living funnily freely in every country other than our motherland of foolish politicians and the like. It may of course be poisonous if mishandled! 

The hypothesis, that hard water, metal ions and glyphosate was probably the cause of CKDu was propounded by a few scientists in the Rajarata University

All substances are poisons said the founder of the science of pharmacology over 600 years ago. What matters is the quantity and how it is used. It applies not only to agrochemicals, but pharmaceuticals too. If you swallow 50 pills of aspirin you may drop dead. Statins, for example, the cholesterol lowering drug now taken by nearly a quarter of the elderly population of the world, and once thought to be absolutely safe, is now known to cause diabetes! 
There are various alleged etiolating agents such as heavy metals(arsenic, cadmium), hard water, fluoride and ionicity ( dissolved salts) just to name a few. What is hitherto known, however, with a degree of certainty in that people who drank water from dug wells in the affected areas of the North Central Province and some neighbouring areas contacted the disease, but not the people who drank river, reservoir, or spring water. This fact has been elegantly established by a study of two adjoining villages, Sarabumi and Badulupura in Girandurukotte. People in the highlands of Badulapura drink water from dug wells, whereas those in Sarabumi from the river or reservoirs. Villagers from both areas had common paddy tracts in the lowlands, and consumed their own paddy. In fact it is reported that one person in the Sarabumi area who was diagnosed with the disease had previously lived for a long period in Badulupura before moving to Sarabumi. The disease wasnt there before people were settled in the Mahaweli Scheme. The increasing population and settlements thereafter necessitated digging of wells for drinking water in homesteads. There are supposedly some 172, 000 such wells in the Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa Districts alone, and the governments urgent task should be to give potable water to the people of all affected areas. Is it happening 
The hypothesis, that hard water, metal ions and glyphosate was probably the cause of CKDu was propounded by a few scientists in the Rajarata University. In fact on top of that publication, which appeared in a fee-levying, open access journal in 2014, the word Hypothesis was written in bold letters! Several reputed chemists have been very critical of the hypothesis and no other scientific journal had any publication supportive of it. It has been argued that if such metal complexes formed in hard water, they should precipitate making the metals unavailable in solution. 
There were two comprehensive WHO studies on CKDu in Sri Lanka, one was in 2013 and the other 2016, the latter being an International Expert Consultation of 54 participants, including local experts. None of those studies implicated glyphosate in CKDu. In fact the first study among other things reported that 3.5% of the CKDu patients had glyphosate above reference limits. However, for some unknown reason the percentage of control patients with urine glyphosate values exceeding the reference level wasnt reported. On re-analysis of the raw data again in 2016, it was revealed that double (7.0%) the non-CKDu subjects had urine glyphosate levels exceeding reference limits! In fact the percentage of non-CKDu subjects with pesticide residue levels above reference limits was significantly higher than that of the CKDu subjects. 
The association of the disease with farming communities naturally tempts one to think of an involvement of agrochemicals in the disease. But the fact is that the great majority of people living in these areas are farmers, and the clue that it is probably associated with drinking water is what must be pursued in the pursuit for identification of the aetiology. 

It is unfortunate that we live in a country that scientific decisions are made by politicians. We need an organisation of professionals

The glyphosate levels reported by a study of the Registrar of Pesticides in 2016 are very low, being less than 1 part per billion in samples of soil, water and vegetables analysed. The maximum allowable limit in drinking water in the European Union is as much as 700 parts per billion! So there is no question of glyphosate pollution of our food, water or soil. 
Ganeshalingam of the Peoples Movement for Plantation Land Rights speaking at this press meeting has even claimed that he has information of victims of CKDu in all estates. This is the first time we are hearing of the disease in the hill country! Has he brought this to the attention of the health authorities in the country So far, the evidence is that the disease is confined only to the Dry Zone. 
It is unimaginable that all these representatives of organisations that have made various utterances, havent been mindful of the key issue of the tea plantations, and that is the grave scarcity of labour. Its impossible to use labour for weeding because of the shortage. Moreover, although a learned professor speaks of alternative weeding technologies, can he demonstrate them in tea lands The only alternative other than chemical weeding is physical weeding with implements such as the mammoty and the sorandiya which, prior to the 1960s, caused serious soil erosion which led even to abandonment of vast tracts tea of land especially from the mid-country. It has been estimated that losses due to crop-weed competition and weed interference in field operations such as plucking and manuring has cost over Rs six billion in 2015 alone. 
Its true that rice can be cultivated without glyphosate, but weed control prior to land preparation needs substantial water use for impounding. It is estimated that some 20% of the water has to be used for weed control in rice, and water has a cost. 
There is clear evidence that the acreage under field crops has declined after the ban of glyphosate.
In particular ploughing and harrowing cannot control the noxious weed Cyperus which must be killed with a contact herbicide, and glyphosate is ideal for this purpose. The corn farmers complain that their pre-plant weed control has shot up from Rs. 3,000 to Rs. 10,000 after the glyphosate ban, especially because of the need to uproot mana grass by mamoty. Eight labour units are required each costing Rs. 1,250. Many of the dry zone farmers have been hoodwinked by the anti-glyphosate lobby that it causes CKDu. When explained to them that there is no evidence to associate glyphosate with the disease, they were aghast! 
It is unfortunate that we live in a country that scientific decisions are made by politicians. We need an organisation of professionals that make evidence-based decisions. India has an excellent one, the National Technology Commission which would have been the organisation making the decision on a matter such as the glyphosate issue were it necessary.

SAITM controversy: GMOA tells PM to prove pledges through action
	
The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) today urged Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to prove the governments attempt to solve the issues regarding the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) controversy through actions and not by talk.
GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge told a news conference that even though they had made many attempts to discuss these issues with President Maithripala Sirisena, the Prime Minister and several ministers, those discussions turned futile due to the intervention of an invisible force.
We have called off our recent strike following a discussion held with Law and Order Minister Sagala Rathnayaka and he had assured us of releasing the university students who were arrested on baseless charges. Those students were to be released yesterday but it has been disrupted due to the absence of the Attorney General in courts, he said.
He said there was no use of carrying out discussions and arriving at conclusions in such a manner and added that it could be considered as a huge issue. He also said therefore the Executive Committee of the GMOA had decided not to take part in any discussions in formation of minimum standards to medical education.
He said even though the Prime Minister had advised his secretary to conduct immediate necessities to standardize the medical education, the other related authorities including legal institutes were not in support to carry on it.
The government should reveal this invisible force behind these incidents, whose intervention which has caused contradictions of the agreements arrived by the government and us. We would not take apart in any discussion until the government reveals this force that was sabotaging these proceedings, he said. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)
