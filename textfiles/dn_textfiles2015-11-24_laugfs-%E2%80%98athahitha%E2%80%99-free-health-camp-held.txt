LAUGFS Gas PLC, recently held a free health camp entitled ‘LAUGFS AthaHitha’ at the Manelwatta Temple in Bollegala, demonstrating its commitment to the local community.

Providing technical assistance for the initiative was Dr.Lakshman Weerasena (MBBS, FCGP), who was a past President of both the Independent Medical Practitioners Association of Sri Lanka (IMPA) and the Medico-Legal Society of Sri Lanka. A team of 10 experienced Doctors specialising in Cardiology, Endocrinology, Dermatology, Paediatrics, Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Rheumatology and ENT were present at the health camp aiding Dr. Weerasena.
In addition to the medical specialists, there was a 10-member paramedical team assisting the doctors with their work. The staff of LAUGFS Gas PLC also played a pivotal role during the programme, with some 40 employees engaging at the Health Camp as volunteers.
Hundreds of locals from the surrounding community were able to benefit immeasurably from the Health Camp, receiving free check-ups and diagnoses, as well as free tests and treatment from the specialist medical team.
Those in need of further treatment were referred to various hospitals on the recommendation of the onsite Doctors, while prescribed medication were also issued free of charge.
Nawaloka Hospital, who was also present at the Camp, administered ECG scans prescribed by Doctors while medical practitioners from the hospital conducted free Body Mass Index (BMI) tests and dispensed useful dietary advice. The health camp also featured an eye clinic where a reputed Optometrist conducted sight tests and issued 150 pairs of spectacles free of charge. Further, Nestle Lanka sponsored a free Nestomalt drink distributed among all participants.
