In its efforts to stay ahead with technological advancements and provide its stakeholders with a range of updated services for their convenience and further development, the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka (CA Sri Lanka) recently launched the Continuing Professional Development (CPD) online tool for the benefit of its members. 


The CPD online tool allows the members to plan their CPD activities, keep track of their CPD progress and upload their individual CPD activities online.  


CPD is a mandatory requirement for chartered accountants, which helps enhance their professional competency and also help them remain relevant with changes at a local and international level. 
Speaking during the launch, CA Sri Lanka President Lasantha Wickremasinghe said that one of the most unique features of a chartered accountant is the constant need to remain relevant. 
“This is why we take every effort to update the CPD services we offer our members, to ensure they are in line with their global counterparts at all times,” he said.  Wickremasinghe noted that the CPD online tool was an important initiative as it will help members keep up with their CPD activities and monitor their CPD hours at all times at the simple click of a button. 


CA Sri Lanka CPD Committee Chairman Heshana Kuruppu said that CPD is a structured approach to lifelong learning and is helpful in developing professional competences required to perform the roles of chartered accountants effectively. 


“Therefore, it is the responsibility of each CA Sri Lanka member to develop and maintain professional competency by undertaking relevant CPD activities,” he said.  He also noted that in order to facilitate enhanced services for the members, the institute has also taken steps to carry out a learning need analysis survey to understand the CPD requirement of the members. 
“Based on the outcome of this analysis, we will come up with the relevant, common CPD programmes to meet the needs of our members to ensure they remain relevant with current developments and changes,” he said.
