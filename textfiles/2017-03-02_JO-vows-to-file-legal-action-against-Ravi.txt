JO vows to file legal action against Ravi


	

The joint opposition today said it would file cases against Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake in the Supreme Court next week, regarding allegations made by him against former President Mahinda Rajapaksa in connection with the issuance of the gazette notifications linked to the Central Bank (CB) bond issue.

Joint opposition MP Bandula Gunawardane told a media briefing that Minister Karunanayake had challenged Mr. Rajapaksa to take legal actions against him and added that a leader like Mr. Rajapaksa was not worthy of such a challenge since he was the one who had taken up the challenge to end the 30-year long terrorism in Sri Lanka.

“Therefore, Mr. Rajapaksa does not need to take legal actions against him, as the joint opposition we will file many cases against him on the matter. The gazette notification was issued in January, 2015 in connection with the Appropriation Bill (2014-No.41). However, the issued gazette notification included details related to years 2011-2013. It is not acceptable,” he said.

He said Minister Karunanayake and the government were attempting to put the blame of the issue on Mr. Rajapaksa and former CB Governor Ajith Nivard Cabraal, and to sweep the issue under the carpet. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)
