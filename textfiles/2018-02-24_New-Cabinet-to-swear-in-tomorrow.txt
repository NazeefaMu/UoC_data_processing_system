Higher Education and Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella and Public Enterprise Development Minister Kabir Hashim may swap their portfolios in the Cabinet reshuffle likely to take place tomorrow.

The United National Party (UNP) had has decided to re-arrange the portfolios assigned to it under the National Unity Government, party sources said.

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe is said to have requested Mr Kiriella to accept the post of Public Enterprise Development in the reshuffle.

Besides, the party leadership has requested some senior members to step down, to accommodate newcomers in the Cabinet. However, these seniors have resisted the request.

The UNP was struggling to finalize its list yesterday due to disagreement among its members, which is seen as the main reason for the delay in the new Cabinet being sworn in.

Meanwhile, President Sirisena is reported to have told some senior members that he intended to swear-in the new ministers tomorrow. (Kelum Bandara)
