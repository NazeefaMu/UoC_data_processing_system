The enormity of an antipathy!


	



 

A prominent yahapalanaya top team member, hailing from a remote corner of Sabaragamuwa, was addressing a group of Diyawanna colleagues at a lobby session the other day.

 


He was, in fact, holding forth on the coming big poll and the aspirants likely to enter the race.


Meanwhile, another group led by a JO pundit on law points dressed in immaculate white national attire came there.


By this time, the members of the first group had started mentioning the names of likely candidates for the big race.


The top team member turning to the JO group inquired whether it was correct that they had decided to field so and so at the big poll. The group members confirmed it in unison.  Another member mentioned that the Green Party leader was too due to come forward as a candidate. At this stage, a JO member mentioned a name of a prominent yahapalanaya figure and asked:


“Is it true that he too is set to enter the race?”


It was the top team member who was the first to react to this seemingly innocuous inquiry. He appeared highly worked up. “You take this from me…” he blurted out turning to the JO members. “Even if we decide to vote for your boss, this guy will not get our votes!”


They say that this revelation came as a bombshell and all JO members looked on wide-eyed!
