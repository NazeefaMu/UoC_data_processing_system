Extravagance at public expense


	

There is a head of a key government institution who often assumes a holier-than-thou attitude often telling others that cutting down unnecessary public expenditure is the best way to reduce the country’s debt burden.

 


However, informed sources say that this high-up has bought a Mercedes Benz on hire-purchase involving 60 monthly instalments of Rs.525,000 each when he has already got a Montero jeep in a sound condition at his disposal. This jeep is the vehicle that his predecessor used. 


The Mercedes Benz he has now hire-purchased will cost the exchequer a hefty Rs.31.5 million by the time the last monthly instalment is paid, they say.
