A comprehensive revamp of the website of Commercial Bank of Ceylon has dramatically changed the look and feel, as well as the functionality of the online portal through which the bank offers information as well as access to a wide range of services.


A stand-out feature of the overhaul is the website’s enhanced responsiveness to access via phone devices and tabs, in acknowledgement of the growing popularity of mobile banking. New mobile-friendly interfaces and interaction allow faster and smoother access to information and tools on mobile devices.


The use of the latest technologies for animation and interaction augments speed and user experience, along with several important changes in the way information is organised and presented and made user-responsive.


“The importance of the website continues to grow exponentially, because more and more people have become tech savvy and conduct their information gathering online,” said Commercial Bank Deputy General Manager Marketing Hasrath Munasinghe.


“The redesign of the website enables us to deploy the very latest in web development technologies to offer more to users and to reflect the newer visual identities of the bank.” The visual changes that are instantly noticeable to visitors to www.combank.lk represent an adoption of current design standards and methodologies and an update of the imagery associated with the bank. Additionally, by bringing prominent visual elements that provide access to services to the forefront, Commercial Bank provides faster Internet access to visitors. Enhanced Geo-location functionality for the bank’s branch network enables the website to automatically pick up the locations of users who have allowed it and show them the closest available branch, with distance calculations.
The streamlining of product information through an all-inclusive mini product portal from which users can get whatever information they need without clicking through to other pages and persistent favourite pages that make it possible for users to save pages they frequently visit, significantly enhance the user experience.


Another key feature of the revamped website is a needs-based user guidance wizard, which simulates the personalised interaction experienced at a branch via a tool that captures a user’s needs and guides that user to the product or service that is most suitable for the requirement at hand.
Visitors to the website can now fulfil all requirements of information on products and services and also apply for these facilities by obtaining applications from the site, the bank said.
