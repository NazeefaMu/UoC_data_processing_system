Soul Sounds experiments with ‘Midnight Music’


	



Soul Sounds is not an unfamiliar name to Sri Lankan music lovers. Having started out by singing carols in the 1990s, the choir has grown and expanded immensely to the level of continuously bringing fame to Sri Lanka in the international sphere as well. It may well be said that Soul Sounds is the most known and reputed choir in the country. Upon hearing that the choir is attempting something unusual, the Daily Mirror decided to pay a visit to their rehearsing studio and see what they were up to. The unconventional experience the choir intends presenting to you is ‘Midnight Music’, a concert to be held at midnight for the first time in Sri Lanka.The concert will be held at St. Andrew’s Scots Kirk Church in Colombo on May 11th at 11.30 pm. The Music Director of Soul Sounds Soundarie David Rodrigo was keen to unravel not only about ‘Midnight Music’, but also about the successful journey and memorable moments of the choir.

Following are excerpts of an interview done with Rodrigo.   

What is ‘Midnight Music’ about? How is it different from other performances done by Soul Sounds? 

Soul Sounds has always worked hard towards doing things differently, from our soulful gospel music to new pop choral arrangements and folk arrangements. It has been a learning experience putting together different genres of music for a group comprising female singers. ‘Midnight Music’ will feature more classical repertoire. So I would say that what we are presenting is soothing music, classical in flavor and for the soul. Entrance is free. Soul Sounds is thankful to its exclusive sponsors FAIRWAY HOLDINGS, and DIMO Lanka for enabling them to explore new music and work on different productions.  
 

What inspired you and Soul Sounds to do this concert? 

One of our lead singers, Shehara Liyanage, had just returned from a trip to Norway. She was inspired by a concert she attended at midnight where there had been similar music. Inspired by this, she shared her experiences with the choir and Soul Sounds, being always ready to accept a challenge, wanted to do something similar.   

How was Soul Sounds created?

Soul Sounds was born from the Holy Family Convent Senior Choir that was the first choir to compete in an International Competition in LLangollen Wales, in 2004. Soon upon returning, the girls who were then leaving school wanted to continue with singing and this saw the birth of Soul Sounds. Our first concert was in December 2004 “Moods of Christmas” and this has continued annually for14 consecutive years. We have since then performed many concerts from different genres, both in Sri Lanka and overseas, with the choir having toured Australia, India, China, France, the USA, UK, Malaysia, Kuwait, and South Africa.   

How have the experiences been while the choir performed at international events? 

The experiences have been awesome. It has always been a learning experience for us. We have performed to new audiences and also listened to choirs from other countries. I think performing to an appreciative audience and moving people to tears through music and song are great achievements.   

Why is Soul Sounds an all-women’s choir? 

Well, like I said we started off as the choir from Holy Family Convent, which as you know is a girls’ school. Since then it has just been easier working with women. And this is very subjective!   

You are also a qualified lawyer. What appealed you to become a Music Director?

Yes, I am a lawyer, and I specialized in Entertainment Law. I worked at the SAARC Cultural Centre as Deputy Director for 6 1/2 years. During my term, we put together many cultural projects in the SAARC region. I also do freelance research in Entertainment Law, working with my seniors. My passion is music, so it is obvious that I am drawn towards various music projects. I like challenges and exploring new ideas through arts and culture. So music will always remain an integral part of my life.   

 

Tell us a little about the Soul Sounds Music Academy. 

Soul Sounds Academy focuses on educating those who have a passion to learn music and perform. Whilst the academy makes its largest intake in the form of vocal students, we also have classes in piano, violin, guitar, music therapy, musical theatre, individual classes for classical music and pop and rock. It’s a place where children are given opportunities not only to learn, but also to perform. We are constantly working towards something. Having studied at the Royal College of Music, it has been my dream to create an atmosphere for music making, where there is a platform not just for knowledge sharing, but also for exploring ones own creativity. The staff comprises experienced and qualified teachers. The vocal department, comprising predominantly of senior and lead singers from Soul Sounds, are taking their own experiences forward helping the next generation of singers.   

If you can briefly tell us how Soul Sounds has influenced your lives?   

Soul Sounds is a second family to most of us and it is also our outlet to relieve stress from the daily chores of life. And whilst all of us are engaged in different professions, music has brought us together and kept us bound. There have been challenges, but thankfully we are still together, thanks to the music.The journey has been rewarding and I thank God for the blessings.   

 

What are the other upcoming events?

We have a big POP concert coming up in August and if time allows there would be a concert of local Sinhala and Tamil music this year. Apart from that it would be Moods of Christmas for the 15th year at the Cinnamon Grand in December.
