Launch of Sangam: Festival in Sri Lanka

Pursuant to an announcement made by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, during his visit to Sri Lanka in March, the Indian High Commission will be shortly launching a Festival of India in Sri Lanka.
The theme of the Festival is "Sangam": a confluence of cultures of India and Sri Lanka. The logo of the Festival, which is a pictorial depiction of "Sangam" in Sinhala, Hindi and Tamil, is a manifestation of the symbiotic ties that bind us. Various events will be held as part of the Festival in 2015-16, stated an Indian High Commission press release.
It said, the inaugural event, a mosaic of Indian dance forms, "Nrityarupa" will be held in Colombo on November 19 at the Nelum Pokuna Mahinda Rajapaksa Theatre, at Kandy on November 21 at Hindu Cultural Hall, and at Galle on November 23 at Hall de Galle.
Nrityarupa has been crafted under the direction of Sangeet Natak Akademi, India's National Academy of Music, Dance, and Drama, for the Festival of India. Six dance forms representing the diversity of India's culture have been chosen: Bharatanatyam from southern India; Kathak, the dance form of the north; Odissi, from Odisha in eastern India; Manipuri from the north-eastern state of Manipur; Kathakali from Kerala at the southern tip of the Indian peninsula; and Chhau which covers a wide swathe of territory in the eastern states of the India.
Other events for Festival of India include the participation of Indian authors and a performance by singer Sonam Kalra and her brainchild, Sonam Kalra & The Sufi Gospel Project, at the Galle Literary Festival in January 2016. On the occasion of Republic Day of India, a musical performance will be held in January 2016. Two exhibitions, one on "Digital India" and one on "Cricket Connects" will be held in February 2016. More events under the Festival of India in Sri Lanka will be scheduled later.
The Festival of India is a celebration of our shared civilization heritage and will further strengthen the close links between our peoples and cultures.
