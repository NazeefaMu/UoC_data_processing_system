President Maithripala Sirisena is reported to have requested members of his Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) to withhold their decision to quit the government until December 31, this year.

A group SLFP MPs holding positions in the government were planning to join hands with the opposition by September.

President Sirisena, on the eve of his departure for Bangladesh, met with them and discussed the current status of affairs.

It is learnt that he requested the members to reconsider their decision till December 31. The President reportedly opined that things would turn better for the country by that time.

The Memorandum of Understanding signed between the United National Party and the SLFP for a two-year- period will also lapse in December.

Meanwhile, a section of the SLFP is still contemplating on measures for uniting the two sides. (By Kelum Bandara)
