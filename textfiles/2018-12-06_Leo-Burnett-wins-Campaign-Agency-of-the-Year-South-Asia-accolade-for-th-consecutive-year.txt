Team Leo Burnett Sri Lanka celebrates its commendable victory of winning Campaign Agency of the Year South Asia awards for the seventh year in a row, every year consecutively since 2012, with a Silver for Creative Agency of the Year for 2018. 

The Campaign Agency of the Year awards are held around the world and are open to all media, advertising, creative, digital, PR, independent and specialist agencies. Since the early 1990s, Campaign’s Agency of the Year awards have existed to recognise inspiring leadership, management excellence, outstanding business performance, and overall achievements in advertising and brand communications. 

Commenting on the win, Arosha Perera, CEO of Leo Burnett Sri Lanka said, “First off, I would like to thank our valued clients and partners for their unwavering support of the agency over the years, which has strengthened our confidence in pushing the boundaries of creativity. The agency has done many things right in order to achieve the distinction of winning this prestigious award for seven years in a row. But most of all, I believe it is our close collaboration with clients and the dynamic client-agency relationships that continue to elicit winning campaigns. Our industry partnerships, leadership role, industry-best talent and willingness to adapt to change, have been key factors in our success.”

Leo Burnett remains focused on developing the skill of its existing talent and infusing continuous value addition to their growth as professionals. It is one of the few Sri Lankan agencies with ready access to senior network resources.

Demonstrating its responsible approach to long-term environmental sustainability, Leo Burnett Sri Lanka, in association with Leo Burnett Toronto, created an innovative way of paying homage to Sri Lanka’s rich heritage of Temple Art. Partnering with JAT Holdings, the agency created natural dyes from the thousands of discarded flowers left at altars countrywide. The idea borrows from the Buddhist belief of life being impermanent and converted people’s precious offerings into something more lasting – namely Petal Paint. This range of emulsions was safe and long lasting enough to be used in the creation and restoration of temple art by specialized artists, thereby preserving the island’s history and culture. Many temples – some hundreds of years old – got a new lease of life.

Making history for the country earlier this year, Leo Burnett Sri Lanka’s Petal Paint Campaign for JAT Holdings bagged 2 coveted metals at the celebrated Epica awards along with the distinction of winning a coveted ‘wood pencil’ at the D&AD Impact awards in the Environmental Sustainability category and two 8 Balls at the Leo Burnett Worldwide Global Product Committee.
