He does not want to be classed with other Rajapaksas!


	


	
	Certain Blue bigwigs were quite frank in expressing their views about the previous regime at the informal discussions held on the sidelines of the two-day workshop held at the Full Moon hotel in Katunayake recently.

Some Blue seniors were deeply engrossed in such a colloquy at that event when a certain member of the Rajapaksa family walked in. An uneasy silence ensued. Because their discourse centered on the doings of the Rajapaksas.
There was no need for the new arrival to have a sixth sense to put two and two together as regards what these party seniors were talking about.
“True, I too am a member of the Rajapaksa family,” he told the group of party seniors. “But please don’t treat me as a party to all misdeeds committed by the other Rajapaksas.”
Who is this Rajapaksa family member who washed his hands off the doings by the other Rajapaksas?  Perhaps you may guess the correct answer!
