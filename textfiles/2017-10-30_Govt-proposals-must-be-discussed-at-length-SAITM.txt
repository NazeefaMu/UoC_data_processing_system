“Among the matters of concern arising from the said proposals are issues concerning graduates, students, parents and the staff of SAITM. Therefore, these proposals need to be discussed at length with all stakeholders to ensure that justice was meted out to concerned parties,” the SAITM mangement said.

It said it hoped that SAITM graduates would be given provisional registration, subject to court proceedings and the current students’ studies would continue without any disruption .

“We also note positively, SAITM founder Dr. Neville Fernando's vision to produce quality non-State doctors will continue despite enormous opposition from various political and other parties with vested interests,” the management said.

It reiterated that SAITM was established as a Degree-Awarding Institution in terms of Section 25A of the Universities Act of 1978 and was recognized by the University Grants Commission (UGC) and the Ministry of Higher Education (MoHE).
