Sandeep’s friends hoping for justice


	

‘The Justice for Sandeep’ a collective comprising friends of Sandeep Sampath Gunawardena,  the victim in the questionable accident in Rajagiriya, said today that they were being accused of making false allegations on the instigation of parliamentarian Udaya Gammanpila.

They said this was not true and rejected these allegations.

Addressing a media briefing held in Colombo, the collective said it wouldn’t repeat the same statements made on the day after the accident if the statements were false.

“Our friend is still in a critical condition and there is no one even to take the responsibility for his treatment. When we went to meet Sandeep’s parents they hugged us and cried. When we heard that necessary legal action was not being taken in connection with this accident we consulted a lawyer and hope to obtain justice for our friend,” one of the victim’s friends said.(Kalathma Jayawardhane)
