'Hajj rituals purify body and soul'
Hajj rituals fill a Muslim's heart with inner peace and tranquilly. Various rituals of Hajj purify one's body and soul. The Hajj festival is also an occasion to propagate unity among all, newly appointed Sri Lankan Ambassador to Palestine and Secretary to the Ad-Diyathush Shazuli-yahtul Fassiya of Sri Lanka, M. Fawzan Anwer said in a Hajj message.
His message adds: "Hajj, one of the five main pillars of Islam, has a message for the benefit and well-being of all people of the world, be they Muslim or not.
"The wonderful message of Hajj is that a Muslim should live in peace with his brothers in humanity, even if they are of different faiths. "Although Hajj is obligatory once in a lifetime for financially and physically capable Muslims, every single Muslim, man or woman, rich or poor, dreams to repeatedly offer it. During the Hajj rituals, a Muslim respects and accepts the opinions of different juristic schools. He should never fight or quarrel with anyone, even those who are different from him in stances and conduct. He lives in peace, leaves others to enjoy peace, and trains himself to be peaceful and forgiving. Thus, respect, mercy, kindness, and tolerance prevail and dominate the Hajj rituals.
"The celebration of Hajj with a shared spirit of joy should strengthen their commitment to live in harmony with all other communities in the cause of peace, reconciliation and national unity. On this happy occasion, I appeal to all to pray for peace and national unity. I send them my good wishes for a happy Eid Mubarak."
