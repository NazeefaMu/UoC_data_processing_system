About 12,000 port workers have launched a token strike protesting against the increase in prices inside the port, the Port Users Collective Union said.


The Association said work had come to a halt inside the Port as vehicles could not enter the premises. Employees handling containers, lorry drivers and assistants, wharf representatives, postmen and contractors are participating in the strike, the Trade Union Collective said.
