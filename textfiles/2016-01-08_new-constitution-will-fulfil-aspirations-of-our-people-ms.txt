The Constitution will be transformed to strengthen the hopes and meet the aspirations and desires of the people where Sri Lankan failed to meet during the post conflict period after the end of the war, President Maithripala Sirisena said.
He said the detractors of the government spared baseless remours that the Constitutional reforms would lead to break the country into two, Buddhism would be destroyed and the armed forces would be weakened on advise of foreign countries.
“But what I have to tell you is that the Constitutional reforms will be used to further unite the country, augment Buddhism and promote reconciliation, communal harmony and economic development in the next four years of the rule of this government,” President Sirisena stressed.
Addressing the main ceremony held to mark the completion of one year of his presidency and the consensual government at the BMICH on Friday evening, President Sirisena said the next four years of the government would be fully dedicated for development, reconciliation, reparation and build one strong and stable country that would provide a safe and peaceful haven to all communities of Sri Lanka.”An of asked question from me foreign leaders, dignitaries, politicians, media personnel and the public is what would be my position after relinquishing executive powers at the end of my term in five years. But I must tell them that I never worry about my position after five years. I am always concerned about the position of ‘Mother Lanka’ after five years. My only desire, hope and expectation is to build a strong, highly developed clean and beautiful country in a five years,” the President stressed.(Sandun A Jayasekera)
