A woman in her late seventies was found abandoned outside the Colombo South Teaching Hospital OPD, Hospital Director Dr.Asela Gunawardhane said.


He said the elderly woman’s physical condition was good but was suffering from short term memory loss.


The doctor said she was not in need of hospital treatment because she was not suffering from any serious illness.


“We have informed the Maharagama police about her situation based on the information given by her. Incident of this nature are common here. We have to keep them in a ward for some months because no one comes to take them home. We have a social responsibility to take care of such people. If they are unwell we can keep them at the hospital and treat them, but if not we do not have the facilities to keep them here for a long time,” said Dr. Gunawardane.


“We hope we will receive some information which will be of help,” he added.
