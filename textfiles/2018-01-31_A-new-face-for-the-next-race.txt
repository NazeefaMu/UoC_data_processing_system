A new face for the next race


	



 

A prominent Buddhist monk is on a hunt for a new face for a high political office in the country, they say.

 


The monk is known to have played a lead role in the popular movement that heavily campaigned to usher in yahapalanaya.


He has confided in his close associates about the high political office he has in his mind for the new ideal candidate he is looking for. 


The prelate has already held consultations with several political party heavyweights in pursuit of his new mission which is reportedly backed by a powerful personality.


The monk is confident of finding the new face they are looking for in the near future though it is yet to appear on the horizon.


Some sections in yahapalanaya have welcomed the move by the monk while some others have reacted to the news with a grim face, they say.
