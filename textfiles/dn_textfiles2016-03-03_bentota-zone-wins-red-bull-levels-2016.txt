Bentota Zone wins Red Bull Levels 2016

Following an intense day of sun, sea and sand, Bentota Zone emerged victorious at the second edition of Red Bull Levels as they conquered the ultimate test of body and mind on February 21st 2016 at Bentota Beach by Cinnamon.
"We are so happy to have won a competition in our hometown, in front of all our friends and family," said local winners, Bentota Zone. "We owe it all to Red Bull, all the sponsors and our very own Bentota Beach by Cinnamon for making this happen. We look forward to competitions like this in the future and we will be ready to win again!"
Red Bull Levels is inspired by age-old techniques to deliver an all-new experience, combining the traditional mastery of stilt fishing and toddy-tapping in an obstacle course unlike anything the world has ever seen before.
This year, Bentota Zone competed against 59 other teams in a challenging race across five traditional fishing stilts of different heights.
The rising tides and sunshine of Bentota Beach made the course tougher by the hour as each team raced against the clock on tightropes from stilt to stilt.
Bentota Zone breezed through the Group Qualifying Stages, but the competition grew fierce as they endured the tropical heat of the Quarter-Finals and the crashing waves of the Semi-Finals.
After much determination, Bentota Zone faced the other three teams Sharks, One Summer and 2015 Champions A350 in the Grand Finals where they triumphed with a winning time of 5.46.54 minutes.
Second Runners Up, One Summer hailing from Russia said, "This is our first competition in Sri Lanka, and we are so happy that Red Bull has organized an amazing event for the tourists as well. We owe it all to our team captain for his leadership, and the high level of organisation from Red Bull!"
Dileep Mudadeniya, Head of Brand Marketing for Cinnamon Hotels & Resorts commented, "It's not every day Bentota sees this level of excitement! We are delighted to have hosted this unique event in partnership with Red Bull and look forward to promoting the authentic culture of Sri Lanka on more non-traditional platforms like these in the future."
He further added, "Bentota Beach by Cinnamon serves as the ideal location for an event such as Red Bull Levels as it is located in the watersports capital of Sri Lanka, thereby providing ample activities for participants to revel in, to make the event that much more exciting."
