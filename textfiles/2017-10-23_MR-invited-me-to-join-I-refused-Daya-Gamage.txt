Former president Mahinda Rajapaksa invited me to join hands with him or to give up politics and join his business but I refused, Primary Industries Minister Daya Gamage said.

Addressing a group of fresh water prawn farmers in Chilaw, the Minister said the former president offered him a Cabinet post but he refused as he had no intention to rob public money.

“I had no intention to rob money belonging to the country, or the public by joining hands with the Rajapaksa regime. Therefore I choose a different path,” he said.

He said President Maithripala Sirisena had given the leadership to save the country from the present predicament, therefore everybody should work together to save the country. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
