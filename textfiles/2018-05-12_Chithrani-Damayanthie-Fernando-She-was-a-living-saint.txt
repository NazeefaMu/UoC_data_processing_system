Those we love go away   

They walk beside us everyday   

Years may pass and fade away     

But memories of loved ones are here to stay   

1st May 2018 marked 12 months after she departed to be with the Lord.   

 

We were all made to look poorer by the untimely demise of one of its most humble and helpful persons. The ever smiling and lovable character Chithrani Damayanthie Fernando came into my life 37 years ago when I got married to the cousin of Damayanthie’s husband Warren. Her affection was contagious. Her care and concern were irrespective of considerations of class, caste or creed, and no recipient could ever resist responding to that disarming love which knew no bounds in transmission. Immense were the acts of her love, sharing and feeling   

for people both rich and poor.   

 

A product of Methodist’ College she never lost her common touch as she was able to move with the highs and lows of society. She was a prominent participant in all family activities in which she saw her stewardship prosper.   

 

Damayanthie was a hands-on individual who would do her utmost to alleviate the hardships faced by the underprivileged with her persuasive tactics. She would walk the extra mile to help anyone in need.   

 

Aggression was never in her vocabulary. She was a beautiful lady who had a beautiful heart. She had compassion, understanding, love, joy, happiness and the readiness to forgive and forget. She was courageous and never hesitated to stand up for justice.   

 

I will never forget her hospitality when we were experiencing a crisis in our lives in 1988. Her home was our home during that crisis period. The bedroom of Warren and Damayanthie were given to me and my wife and I have no words to describe the way she treated us. Early morning she would bring the cup of tea and in the night a glass of milk without fail.   

 

We as a family will feel the void left by our loving cousin’s absence. She was more of a sister than a cousin to Roshani and me. We were blessed to have her in our lives. We will remember the occasions she helped us, especially those calls to check after a court hearing regarding my cases.   

 

Many would speak of her and share their thoughts of her remarkable and unshakable faith in God. How can anyone forget that smile of hers, which always meant so much to those who met her. We here on earth, will always love and miss our loving cousin so much.  I would like to extend our heartfelt condolences to her dearly beloved husband, Warren. who stood by her at all times and to her children Gayathrie, Gayan and Ramesh   

Death is not the greatest loss in life; the greatest loss is what dies within while we live.   

She was indeed a living Saint.   

Damayanthie, may you rest in peace.   

Premakumar Fernando
