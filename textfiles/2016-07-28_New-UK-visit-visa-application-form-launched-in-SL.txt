New UK visit visa application form launched in SL


	

As part of a global rollout, a new visa application form, Access UK, has launched in Sri Lanka for customers applying for a UK visit visa, the British High Commission in Colombo announced.

The new form will make it quicker and easier for customers to apply for their UK visa. Benefits include:

-A shorter form, with questions logically ordered based on customer feedback

-More local languages, although customers will need to provide their answers in English

-The application fee is displayed in the correct local currency

-Customers can apply, book their Visa Application Centre (VAC) appointment to give biometrics, and pay for the relevant service standard seamlessly

-The service is available on mobile devices

-The form can pre-populate a Schengen Visa application form which customers can then download and print. This makes it much easier for customers applying for both visas at the same time.

Following the successful launch of Access UK in China in June 2014, UKVI is rolling it out globally to customers applying for a Standard Visitor Visa, Visitor (Marriage & Civil Partnership), or Visitor (Permitted Paid Engagement) Visa, it said.

To make it more straightforward for customers, Access UK will soon be rolled out in Hindi, Tamil, Gujarati and Bengali, with a roll-out of more languages planned.

Access UK is available at www.gov.uk/apply-uk-visa. However the Visa4UK website will continue to be available for visitors and for applicants applying visas on other routes, the statement added.

UK Visas & Immigration Regional Director for South and Southeast Asia, Nick Crouch said:

“The UK remains committed to improving the visa service for customers and making it quicker and easier for customers to apply for UK visas.

“The new form, known as Access UK, successfully launched in China in 2014 and received excellent feedback from customers. We have further refined it and are now rolling it out globally. We look forward to hearing further feedback on the form, and hope that it will encourage more customers from Sri Lanka to visit the UK.”

British High Commissioner to Sri Lanka James Dauris said:

“The strong relationship between the UK and Sri Lanka is built on people to people links, including through business relationships and cultural exchange.  The UK welcomes genuine visa applications and the new Access UK form will make the process of applying for a business or tourist visa quicker and easier.”
