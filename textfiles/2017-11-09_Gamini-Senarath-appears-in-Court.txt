Former president’s chief-of-staff Gamini Senarath appeared at the Colombo Fort Magistrate’s Court today.

Mr. Senarath had filed a fundamental rights petition in the Supreme Court on November 6 seeking an order to prevent the Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID) from arresting him in connection with a magisterial inquiry on him, under the Public Property Act.

Meanwhile, former Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation Managing Director Piyadasa Kudabalage and former Samurdhi Commissioner Neil Bandara Hapuwinna also filed two separate FR petitions with an undertaking that they would appear at the Magistrate’s Court today.

They had been named as suspects in a case at the Colombo Fort Magistrate’s Court alleging that they had misused Rs.4 billion in government funds.

On a request by the FCID the Magistrate banned them from leaving the country. (Yoshitha Perera)
