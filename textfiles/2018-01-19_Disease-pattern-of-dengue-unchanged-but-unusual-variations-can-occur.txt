Dismissing reports indicating that the disease pattern or the dengue virus had significantly changed as baseless, Negombo's Clinical Head of the Centre for Clinical Management of Dengue Dr. LakKumar Fernando said there could be some unusual variations of the dengue virus.

He told the Daily Mirror that all diseases and biological events had a classical pattern that affected the majority while some unusual manifestations could occur to a small minority.

“Clinicians should identify these and treat them accordingly to the best of their ability. Treatment can also turn the disease bringing unusual results and with proper treatment most patients can be saved,” Dr. LakKumar said.

Sources had claimed that a new dengue strain had been detected and the behaviour of Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever (DHF) had changed drastically during the dengue epidemic.

According to reports several children with abnormal disease patterns were found and consequently it has become a real challenge to detect and manage the disease.

“It is important for the public to improve their own behaviour to protect themselves from mosquito bites and also doctors to improve their clinical management practices than blame the virus for unusual behaviour," Dr. LakKumar said.

Normally the Platelet count decreases on the third day of a dengue patient, but there are also occasions where Platelet count decreases on the second day.

Normally the leaking of fluid occurs between the 3rd and 4th days, but it can also occur before or after the relevant period.

“Settling of fever alone can deteriorate the nature of dengue. It means that some patients presume that when the fever gets cured, the whole dengue situation has come to an end. Perhaps it is not. The patients have to be more vigilant and go for frequent treatments until it is recommended by a qualified physician,” Dr. Lakkumar said. (Sheain Fernandopulle)
