Archbishop Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith today said that the human rights had become the religion among the Western nations.

He said so attending the morning service of the St. Matthew’s Roman Catholic Church in Ekala.

He said that the human rights were introduced recently but Sri Lankans inclined its through religion for centuries.

“Human rights was found recently. If we can live in a correct manner there is no need for human rights. Those who do not practice religion are the ones who hang on human rights. We should not deceive by these charms. We should act wisely,” he said.

He also added that though the Western nations attempt to teach lessons on human rights to Sri Lanka it has a multireligious society that practice human right through religion for centuries. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
