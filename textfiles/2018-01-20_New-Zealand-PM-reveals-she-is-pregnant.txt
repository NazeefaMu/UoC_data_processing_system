WELLINGTON AFP Jan19, 2018- New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced Friday she is expecting her first baby, and is set to become the country’s first leader to give birth while in office.   


The 37-year-old, who was sworn in last October, made global headlines when she slapped down pre-election questions over whether she intended to start a family, insisting pregnancy had no bearing on a woman’s career opportunities.   


Ardern was all smiles Friday as she appeared with partner Clarke Gayford at their home to announce the “unexpected but exciting” news of their first baby.   


 “Clark and I are really exited to share...that in June we are looking forward to welcoming our first child,” she told reporters.   


 The charismatic leader enjoyed a rapid rise to the top ranks of politics, winning office last year just months after taking the helm of the centre-left Labour Party.
