AIA Group Limited announced that it is the only company in the world to have achieved the largest number of Million Dollar Round Table (MDRT) members for two consecutive years. 
MDRT is internationally-recognised as the standard of excellence in the life insurance and financial services business. Its members are required to generate a certain level of premium, commission, and income, and demonstrate exceptional professional knowledge, strict ethical conduct and exceptional client service.
A total of 5,687 AIA agents and agency leaders registered as MDRT members by 1 August 2016, representing an increase of over 47 per cent in members of this elite group from 2015.
“This record-breaking result truly demonstrates the successful delivery of our Premier Agency strategy in driving growth in activity and productivity across the whole of our agency force,” said Joe Cheng, CEO of Group Agency Distribution of AIA Group.
“Our Premier Agency strategy places particular focus on the quality of our agents, spanning from the recruitment process to training and professional development. We also invest significantly in technology to help our agents improve the means by which they serve our customers through our innovative digital platforms. Our commitment to our Premier Agents not only allows us to provide high quality and professional service to meet the growing needs of our customers throughout the region, it also underpins the sustainability and quality of our growth.”
Launched in 2010, AIA’s Premier Agency strategy has been supporting agents with industry-leading technology. The Group’s interactive Point of Sale (iPoS) system is now well established as the principal sales tool for agents across AIA’s markets. 
This interactive technology allows AIA to enhance customer experience, reduce turnaround times, and increase agent efficiency and productivity. Embedding iPoS in the company’s second-generation interactive Mobile Office (iMO) platform enables AIA’s agents and agency leaders to manage all of their activities, from recruitment and lead generation to the face-to-face sales process and training, efficiently on one single mobile device.
