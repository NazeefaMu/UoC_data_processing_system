A group of Opposition MPs led by UPFA MP Dinesh Gunawardane left Parliament chamber a short while ago in protest over several Financial Acts which are being debated in Parliament.
The MPs claimed the government was attempting to pass the Acts illegally.
However, Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said that the Attorney General had mentioned that there was no fault in the way the government was passing the Acts. (Yohan Perera)
