A peon is better off than my post as State Minister: Sujeewa


	

State Minister of International Trade Sujeewa Senasinghe said he could not perform even a duty assigned to a peon with his portfolio as State Minister.

“I don't have powers. According to the gazette my duty is 'settlement of disputes'. That has not prevented me from doing my duty despite the problems. I continue with my welfare work. I will quit politics when I am unable to do so. I will not change my party either.”

Addressing an event in Kolonnawa, State Minister Senasinghe also said, “I work with restraint. I know how J.R. worked with patience. Some people ask me whether I have plans to join the opposition. I will remain in the party and not join the opposition. I will rather leave the party and go home without changing the party when I feel that I am unable to do my duties. Even if I am given a powerful post, I will refuse to accept it. We should stick to our principles. If we are neglected, we have nothing to do. Those below our ranks, had gone to the top. They are the favourites. They get top posts. I was deprived of getting a top post above my lawyer’s position. I could have become a President’s Counsel. This government should take advantage from us . There are other MPs who think like me.“ (Shantha Seneviratna)
