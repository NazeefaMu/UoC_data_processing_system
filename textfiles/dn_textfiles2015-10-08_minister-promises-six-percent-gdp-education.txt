The government will allocate six percent of the Gross Domestic Product for education through the next budget by honouring its pledge, said Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake.
The minister said so participating as Chief Guest of the certificate awarding ceremony for the winners of a drawing competition held at Sri Sanghabodhi Vidyalaya, Thotalanga recently.
"Education should not be confined to book knowledge. Children should be accorded the opportunity to showcase their talents in sports, aesthetics and other fields. We all have a responsibility towards ensuring sound education for children," the minister said.
He said Dr. C.W.W. Kannangara introduced free education to guarantee a better future for children. However, contrary to ideals of free education, the allocation for education had witnessed a gradual decline over the years, he said.
"The government aims to transform schoolchildren into purposeful citizens. We are ready shoulder this responsibility. We will bring about radical changes through education by increasing the allocation," Karunanayake said.
"Our objective is to make Sri Lanka the country with the best education system in Asia," he said.
