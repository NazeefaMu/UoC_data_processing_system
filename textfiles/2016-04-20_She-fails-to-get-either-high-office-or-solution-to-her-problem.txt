She fails to get either high office or solution to her problem!


	



 

A fair Diyawanna member, who faces the threat of forfeiting her seat in the august assembly over a ‘personal problem’, was for some time working her way into the graces of a high political authority seeking his influence to sort out her problem. 

 


Finding that the expected help was not forthcoming, she has now begun running again after her mentor, a former political strongman, they say.


The fact that three other members hailing from her district have now been raised to higher status overlooking her, had made her realise that she had gone after the wrong person.


She had met the political authority on several occasions seeking his help and was inching towards the yahapalanaya to the chagrin of her camp mates. She had even absented herself from the House at the vote-taking on an important Bill taking no chance of incurring the displeasure of the high political authority - all in vain.
