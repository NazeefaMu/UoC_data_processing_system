	Lawyers appearing for former defense secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa, Avant Garde Chairman Nissanka Senadipathi, former Navy Commanders Jayantha Kolabage, Jayantha Perera, and former assistant secretary to the defense ministry Damayanthi Jayaratne raised objections over the PRECIFAC naming their clients as respondents in an inquiry into the alleged fraud and corruption at Rakna Arakshaka Lanka Ltd when the matter was taken up before the commission today.
	Presidents Counsel Kuvera De Zoysa, Attorneys Sugath Kaldera and Nishan Premathiratne who appeared for them at the inquiry today argued that their clients should not have been named as respondents in the inquiries.
	On hearing the submissions, the commission asked the lawyers to furnish in writing why their clients should not be regarded as responsible in the inquiry on or before December 2, a senior official of the commission said.
	He said the commission had not taken a decision to name the former defence secretary, Avant Garde Chairman Nissanka Senadipathi, former Navy Commanders Jayantha Kolabage, Jayantha Perera, and former assistant secretary to the defense ministry Damayanthi Jayaratne as respondents even though the lawyers raised legal points over that.
	The official said the next public hearing on inquiries into the Rakna Arakshaka Lanka controversy had been fixed for December 3, 4, 11, 22 and 23.
	Mr. Rajapaksa, the Avant Garde Chairman, the former Navy Commanders Jayantha Kolabage, Jayantha Perera, and former assistant secretary to the defence ministry were yesterday summoned by the commission to record evidence with regard to the alleged fraud and corruption at the Rakna Arakshaka Lanka Ltd.
	However, Avant Garde Chairman Nissanka Senadipathi did not appear before the commission today as he was out of the country. (Ajith Siriwardana)
