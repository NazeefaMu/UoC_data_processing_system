We restored subsidies to the new Budget proposals - Nimal

Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said that certain subsidies pruned in the original budget proposals by the Finance Minister were restored after pressure was exerted at the Cabinet meeting. Accordingly the fertilizer subsidy; the Rs. 80 per kilo guaranteed price for green tea; the stable price for paddy and for rubber remain unchanged, he said.
He said their action also forced the Finance Minister to drop the proposal to amalgamate the Samurdhi fund with the National Savings Bank, and enabled state banks to continue providing leasing facilities. He said both the President and the Prime Minister, as pragmatic and democratic leaders, had responded positively to the representations made by them.
The Minister, addressing a 'Jana Hamuwa', in Welimada, December 20, said certain people had thought the present government would fall within a few weeks.
"This government cannot be defeated for another four and a half years. According to the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, not even the President has the power to dissolve the government for four and a half years," he said.
The Minster also said it was the bounden duty of the SLFP to capture power at the forthcoming local government elections.
