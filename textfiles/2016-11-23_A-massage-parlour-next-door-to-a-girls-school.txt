A massage parlour next door to a girls’ school


	



 

A massage parlour has been opened in Colombo 7 in close proximity to a well-known girls’ school which had produced even a Prime Minister and a President of the country, they say.

 


Discreet inquiries made by highly ruffled parents have revealed that a political heavyweight whose two-syllable name -- a household word in the country these days -- is the real weight behind the person who opened the parlour. 


Girl students as well as their parents have already made representations to the Big Two in the regime about the unwelcome parlour close to the school.


However, the authorities have so far turned a deaf ear to their representations. Concerned parents wonder now whether they have to make their supplications to some powerful deity given the deafening silence on the part of those responsible in yahapalanaya.
