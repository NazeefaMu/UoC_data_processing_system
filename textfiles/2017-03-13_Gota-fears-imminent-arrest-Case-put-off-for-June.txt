When the fundamental rights petition filed by former defence secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa was taken up by the Supreme Court today, the Additional Solicitor General Yasantha Kotagoda said investigations were continuing.

He said if there was evidence of a cognizable offence the mandatory requirement was to arrest the offender.

The ASG appearing for the respondents and the Attorney General told Court that the interim order preventing the Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID) from arresting him granted on May 13, 2015 was still in operation and asked Court to fix an early date to argue the rights application.

The Bench comprising Chief Justice Priyasath Dep and Justice Anil Gooneratne fixed the matter for argument on June 15.

The Court had on October 3 last year fixed for yesterday the hearing of the rights petition filed by Mr. Rajapaksa fearing imminent arrest and detention by the FCID. (S.S. Selvanayagam)
