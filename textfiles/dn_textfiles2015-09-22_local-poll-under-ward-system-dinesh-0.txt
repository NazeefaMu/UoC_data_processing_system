Local poll under ward system - Dinesh

No matter what the UNP Working Committee says, according to President Maithripala Sirisena, the next Local Government election will be held according to the ward system.
The system of holding elections should not be changed/decided on the chances of one political party having to win the election, MEP Leader and MP Dinesh Gunawardena said.
Addressing the media in Colombo yesterday, he said this was announced by the President during a meeting held recently between President Sirisena and the SLFP MPs. President Sirisena is powerful than the Working Committee of the UNP.
Therefore the next LG Polls will be held under the ward system. MP Gunawardena pointed out that the people of Sri Lanka demanded a new electoral system and therefore the next LG Polls should be held under the new system.
The electorates had been demarcated and amendments had been made by the committee headed by Speaker Karu Jayasuriya. There is no way of going back to the preferential system.
Speaking on the latest UNHRC Report on Sri Lanka, Gunawardena said the Commission Report handed over to President Sirisena by retired High Cort Judge Maxwell Paranagama should be presented in Geneva. In that report he (Paranagama) vehemently rejected the 40,000 deaths claim made in the UN Report. The Sri Lankan judiciary is independent and has the capability of conducting any type of investigation. That is why Sri Lankan judges functioned and still function in International bodies and in foreign countries. Considering hearsay evidence and producing witnesses after 30 years is unacceptable on any grounds, he added.
