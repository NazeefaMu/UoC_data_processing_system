App to help Colombo commuters
	
A mobile travel application is to be introduced by the Ministry of Megapolis and Western Development in a bid to further reduce traffic congestion and facilitate convenient travelling to the ordinary passenger.
Minister Champika Ranawaka explained it as a cloud application which could be downloaded to smart devices allowing the public to be aware of traffic congestion in the area as well other information such as bus time tables.
The Ministry aimed to pull out passengers before or after peak hours to reduce congestion at the time.
People can save time and fuel by doing this, he said.
A pilot project had already been conducted in Kandy and the results and experience gained through the project was sufficient to implement the same in Colombo.
He also said that the Innovation & Entrepreneurship Department of the Moratuwa University had developed the application. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Arundika removed for criticising Govt: Namal
	
Deputy Minister Arundika Fernando was removed from his ministerial portfolio because he criticised the government and its work , MP Namal Rajapaksa said today.
He said Mr. Fernando had attempted to put the government to the right track and as a result he lost his portfolio.
The MP said both President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe stated that the ministers had a democratic right to reveal the wrongdoings of the government.
However, the government expels those who reveal wrongdoings. They expelled Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe first and now did the same to Deputy Minister Fernando. The government shows to the international that they are democratic but remove its own ministers who criticize government work, he said.
He said that Mr. Rajapakshe was sacked and threw-out for criticising the Hambantota Port selling and Mr. Fernando was removed for telling the government to stop revenging.
Therefore, Mr. Rajapaksa said that the entire unity governments democracy was a lie.
Meanwhile, he said the government was attempting to survive by launching an oppressive programme.
Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake is criticising religious leaders. He also challenges the countrys law and order, he said.
MP alleged that both the Presidents and the Premiers actions have made the government members to criticise the judiciary and the back bench Parliamentarians are also acts with taking the law on to their hands as a result. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

The swarthy big one who lost his high office soon after switching from finance to foreign affairs is said to be visiting places of religious worship one after another here and abroad these days seeking divine blessings to see an end to the malefic period he is going through.

The former purohita was seen taking things in stride until his kinsman running the development lottery was given the walking papers. Informed sources say that it was the authority in the highest echelons who was responsible for the ouster, not the purohita handling the subject.
The man is in a sulk these days over the shabby treatment meted out to his kinsman after his fall, they say.

Cant compel Aloysius to give evidence: Bond Commission
	
Ruling that Perpetual Treasuries Chairman Arjun Aloysius cannot be compelled to testify before it, the Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) into the bond issue today informed his counsel Gamini Marapana PC to notify the commission regarding the willingness of his client to give evidence by tomorrow.
Delivering a comprehensive order, the PCoI stressed today that it required Arjun Aloysius to testify, but considering the rule of law concept and the established law, as moved by his Presidents Counsel Gamini Marapana that an accused cannot be compelled to give evidence, the Commission was of the view that Aloysius could not be compelled to give evidence if he was unwilling to do so.
The commission, citing various precedents and established laws also stated that Aloysiuss evidence as a witness who possessed knowledge on certain matters was crucial to the Commissions mandate.
Based on the evidence before the Commission so far, the PCoI mentioned in the order that it requires Aloysius to give evidence with regard to matters as to:
i) The reasons for Perpetual Treasuries (Pvt) Ltd bidding for large amounts of Treasury Bonds at some Auctions of Treasury Bonds;
(ii) transactions on the Secondary Market of Treasury Bonds which Perpetual Treasuries (Pvt) Ltd obtained by successful bids at Auctions of Treasury Bonds;
(iii) the dealings and relationship which existed between officers of Perpetual Treasuries (Pvt) Ltd and some officers of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka;
(iv) the dealings and relationship which existed between officers of Perpetual Treasuries (Pvt) Ltd and some officers of the Employees Provident Fund, Pan Asia Banking Corporation PLC and some other Primary Dealers;
(v) whether Perpetual Treasuries (Pvt) Ltd was in possession of information relevant to Auctions of Treasury Bonds which was not available to other Primary Dealers; and
(vi)4he profits and/or capital gains received by Perpetual Treasuries (Pvt) Ltd as the result of the aforesaid transactions on Treasury Bonds and the disposal of these profits and/or capital gains by way of dividends, fund transfers and transfers of profits (if any) and investments.
In addition, the evidence that is now before the PCoI, by way of the testimony of witnesses, documents and several audio recordings, has made it desirable that the Commission of Inquiry requires Mr. Aloysius to give evidence with regard to several matters which are directly within his personal knowledge, including, inter alia:
(i) (the ownership, control and structure of the group of Companies of which Perpetual Treasuries (Pvt) Ltd is a member;
(ii) the role played by Mr. Aloysius in applying for and obtaining a Primary Dealers License from the Central Bank of Sri Lanka;
(iii) the role played by Mr. Aloysius in preparing the Business Plan of Perpetual Treasuries (Pvt) Ltd which was submitted to the Central Bank of Sri Lanka at the time Perpetual Treasuries (Pvt) Ltd applied for a Primary Dealers License and the subsequent Business Models followed by Perpetual Treasuries (Pvt) Ltd;
(iv) the role played by Mr. Aloysius in the day to day operations of Perpetual Treasuries (Pvt) Ltd while he was the Chief Executive of that Company;
(v) the reasons for Mr. Aloysius resigning from the post of Chief Executive of Perpetual Treasuries (Pvt) Ltd;
(vi) the role played by Mr. Aloysius in the day to day operations of Perpetual Treasuries (Pvt) Ltd after he resigned from the post of Chief Executive of that Company;
(vii) the profits and/or capital gains received by Perpetual Treasuries (Pvt) Ltd and the disposal of these profits and/or capital gains by way of dividends, fund transfers and transfers of profits (if any) and investments;
(viii) the audio recordings of telephone conversations which are said to have taken place between Mr. Aloysius and Mr.Kasun Palisena with regard to Auctions of Treasury Bonds held in March 2016 and the matters discussed therein including the information which Mr. Aloysius is said to have claimed, he possessed with regard to those Auctions;
(ix) the role played by Mr. Aloysius with regard to the Fine imposed by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka on Perpetual Treasuries (Pvt) Ltd in April 2016 after the aforesaid Auctions;
(x) the nature of the relationship between Mr. Aloysius and some officers of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka;
(xi) the nature of the relationship between Mr. Aloysius and Mr. Arjuna Mahendran, the previous Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka;
(xii) the nature of the relationship between Mr. Aloysius and some officers of the Employees Provident Fund including Mr. Saman Kumara and Mr. Navin Anuradha;
(xiii) the nature of the relationship between Mr. Aloysius and Mr. Nimal Perera, the previous Chairman of Pan Asia Banking Corporation PLC and the resulting transactions on Treasury Bonds entered into by Pan Asia Banking Corporation;
(xiv) the reasons for Mr. Aloysius telephoning Mr. Richie Dias of Pan Asia Banking Corporation PLC during the period when Mr. Dias was furnishing his statement to the Commission of Inquiry; and
(xv) the reasons for Mr. Aloysius leasing an apartment which was occupied by Mr. Ravi Karunanayake and family.
The Commission was of the view that Aloysius is in a position to provide vital evidence to the Commission with the matters falling within the scope of the inquiry.
Earlier, Mr. Marapana PC citing various precedents and laws said a person who is accused of an offence cannot be compelled to give evidence in the backdrop of the principles reflected in the Constitution as right to fair trial and Presumed innocent until proven guilty.
However, Additional Solicitor General Dappula de Livera had contested earlier that these proceedings are regarded as inquisitorial process and therefore the concepts adapted in criminal procedure cannot be applicable as the Commission is of a fact finding mission.
The Commission considering the both submissions today delivered a comprehensive judgment considering the concepts of Rule of Law, the fairness, and the equity.
The Commission stated in the order that they are mindful of the fact that in the event Aloysius is compelled to give evidence and his evidence is considered in the Commissions report then the question will arise whether to make any recommendation be made available to the Attorney General to take appropriate actions under criminal proceedings because Aloysius evidence would then be an evidence which was compelled to give.
We are not willing to depart from established principles of law. if Aloysius is unwilling to give evidence and does not want to explain and clarify his stance relating to the maters transpired during the proceedings, then the Commission will be compelled to proceed on the basis of the evidence it has, the Commission stated
After the order was delivered, Mr. Gamini Marapana PC said that Aloysius was not prepared to give evidence.
At this point, Chairman of the Commission Justice K. T. Chitrasiri and Commissioner Justice Prasanna Jayawardane reminded Marapana PC to go through the content of the yesterdays order and let the Commission know precisely whether his client is willing or not to give evidence before the commission today (14).

Following confirmed reports that a group of at least 12 Blue party members of the government are about to defect en bloc, several Betel leaf seniors in yahapalanaya have launched a plan behind the scene to hook several stalwarts from the JO. Meanwhile, Number Ones confidant from the deep South holding secretarial status is said to be making a sustained effort to woo a vociferous JO front-liner from the Colombo district whose forte is economics.

However, the gabby one being wooed had reportedly waved off the carrot saying they had gone through the worst for the last three years and they were sufficiently tempered to bide time for yet another two years.

EU praises SL govt. for progress made but states many areas still to be delivered
	
The European Union (EU) on Wednesday praised the Sri Lankan Government for the progress made in advancing human rights, labour and environmental standards but stressed that there were still many areas where reform had yet to be delivered.
EU Ambassador Tung-Lai Margue, who met Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe Wednesday afternoon, said the Governments excellent cooperation is a reminder of how much the situation has changed in the country including real advances in human rights.
However, there are still important concerns about the lack of concrete progress in key areas. Torture has to stop. It is of paramount importance that the Government delivers on its commitments including the replacement of the Prevention of Terrorism Act, he said.
He said the PTA should be replaced with a counter-terrorism legislation consistent with international standards and allowing people in custody to have access to a lawyer from the point of arrest.
Issuing a statement, the EU said concerns were raised about continued discrimination against women and girls and against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Sri Lankans.
Meanwhile, the Ambassador said the fate of those who disappeared at the end of the war should be clarified.
The Ambassador led a team of visiting EU senior officials, who were in the country for the last 10 days on a fact-finding mission, to the meeting with the Premier.
The mission has focused on the status of the implementation of 27 international conventions of which Sri Lanka is a signatory.
The EU said progressive implementation of the conventions is the condition for continued preferential access to the European Union market under the GSP Plus.
The assessment, along with that of the other countries benefitting from GSP Plus, will be published in January 2018. It will be considered by the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers.

The state purohita hailing from the Puttalam district, after exchanging friendly greetings with his old colleagues, had not only taken a number of selfies posing with them, but also had posted a comment on his Facebook page saying that he called at the Pohottuwa political office. Meanwhile, a well-seasoned politico from the prominent political family from Giruwapattu who carefully observed the buoyant behavior of the state purohita had told him: Malli, dont be in such a neck-break hurry to demonstrate your loyalty to Pohottuwa. Go slow. Otherwise, you too may have to do a stint in the state-run lodge - a fate staring in the face of our family members today.

Meanwhile, a story doing rounds in political circles says that he has received an invitation from yahapalanaya and he has indicated that he is prepared to make a positive response if the right offer is forthcoming.
He had initially indicated his preference for the media subject, but given the subject is already being handled by a senior purohita, their attention has turned to an alternative subject like Mahaveli, they say.

How I Found that  Bright and Guiding  Light in my Fathers Loving Wise Eyes
	
PROFESSOR C. C. DE SILVAHow I Found thatBright and GuidingLight in my Fathers Loving Wise EyesA daughters tribute to her doctor father
It is 30 years after my fathers death, and I thought it was time I paid a tribute to him. Sri Lankans from all over the world still contact me to get his book Mother, Your Baby, which they say was the medical bible that their children were brought up on. They want it now so that their children could do the same. My thoughts go back to my childhood when my tall, incredibly handsome father was my hero and the only man in my life! He had little time to spend with us, as he was busy building up his private practice in Dehiwela and in Kollupitiya.
I would long for his company and my happiest hours were spent on his lap, listening in rapt, awesome wonder as he related tales about his childhood and family legends about his grandfather, the late Charles Henry de Soysa. My father to me, was the embodiment of love, faithfulness, sacrificial giving and strong faith. He lost his own father, the late Dr W.H de Silva when he was just four years old and was brought up in his early childhood, by the late Lady Catherine de Soysa, his maternal grandmother at Alfred House.
The late Dr. W.H. de Silva, was the first person from Ceylon to qualify as a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh in Opthalmology and on his return worked without a salary at the Eye Hospital soon after it was built. My fathers colleagues at that time, who were in and out of our home, were all great names in medicine, the Late Professor M.V.P. Peiris, the late Dr. Noel Bartholomeusz, the late Professor Milroy Paul and the late Dr. A.D.P.A. Wijegoonewardene, whose son Preethi, is now my doctor. During the many trips I made with my parents to Europe, it was a privilege to meet leading paediatricians all over the UK, Europe and Scandinavia. 
While in private practice, my father was family doctor to many well-known families and also the school doctor at Bishops College, which was his first Alma Mater, before going on to St Thomas College, Mt Lavinia, where his portrait now adorns its walls as a distinguished old boy. After his schooldays, where Im told he had a brilliant academic record, he entered Medical College here for the first year, and then proceeded to University College, London for the rest of his years as a student where he got his degree. When he returned, he started his private practice here.
My fathers special interest was always Paediatrics and he was made the first Professor of Paediatrics in 1949. It was a sacrifice financially, but his heart was with paediatrics and researching the subject. He was keen on finding out more about both prevention and cures to help decrease suffering in children. He took a special interest in the children in his ward 1 at the Lady Ridgeway Hospital and every Christmas, straight after Church we would go there, laden with gifts for the children and staff.
The children loved him and one of my most vivid memories of those days was the exuberant and loving way, they greeted my father. He was also in charge of the newborn babies at the De Soysa Maternity Hospital. As Professor, he entertained every group of students. Among his favourite students and interns were the late Dr. Tony Don Michael, the late Dr. Hubert Aloysius, the late Dr. Christopher Canagaratne and Dr. Denis Aloysius. Denis related an anecdote when he was once late for a ward round. My father had inquired why and when Denis said he had danced all night, Thaththi had danced with him down the ward to the amusement of staff and patients. Most doctors today refer to father as a legend.Among his other great enthusiastic interests were reading, writing and music. He had a vast library at home, full of every kind of book, biographies, history, fiction and we were encouraged to read anything we wanted to, from his library. He later gifted much of this to the Jaffna library, when it was burnt. He was a founder member of The Ceylon Paediatrics Association, and was its President three times.
The Ceylon Association for the Advancement of Science, where he was President General in 1961 and The Family Planning Association. He founded The Convalescent Home for Children at Talagolla and paid regular visits there even after his retirement. He chaired the National Committee of the Freedom from Hunger Campaign and The Meals for Millions Campaign Foundation of Ceylon. He was also Chairman of the Board of Governors of C.M.S. schools which included Ladies College, Trinity and Mowbray in Kandy and Chundikuli Girls School and St Johns Jaffna and visited all these schools regularly. The first book authored by him was Mother, Your Baby, written in collaboration with Mrs.
Visvanathan and is still being used and talked about. After his visit to Russia, he wrote a book about it called Out Steppes The Don. After his retirement, he chose to live at Kaduwella, grew acres of passion fruit, which unfortunately was lost through land reform, other fruit and had a few chickens as a hobby. Later on he returned to Colombo to my childhood home Ellora Green Path and I occupied the upstairs with my husband and family, while my parents lived downstairs. Despite his failing health, he wrote his autobiography, Life As I Lived It, the title was suggested by me. The book was finished the day before he died and it was my privilege to hand him the first copy to look at. I slept by his side that last night, but left to go to Church early that morning, when I returned he had breathed his last. He was always keen that I follow his footsteps into medicine. Not being a studious, academic type, the idea didnt appeal to me.
But Im glad that I have followed him into his other great interest, writing and I know that from wherever he is, he is my inspiration. I always knew that he was regarded as the last word in Paediatrics in Sri Lanka, but to my surprise, I learned with great pride the other day, about how great a reputation he has in the UK.
A Paediatrician from the UK who was here a few years ago for the Paediatric Conference and the commemoration oration for my father, told me that it was because of my fathers research and writing that Paediatrics gained importance in the world map of medicine. It made my day to hear those words. I miss my beloved Thaththi more and more each day, especially when I feel ill and regret the headaches I gave him in my rather rebellious youth! Oh for the touch of a vanished hand and the sound of a voice that is still. 
He dedicated his autobiography to his six grandchildren, with these words What else is wisdom What of mans endeavor Or Gods high grace so lovely and so great. To stand from fear set free, to breathe and wait. To hold a hand uplifted over hate; and shall not loveliness be loved forever. 
From the translation of Euripedes bySir Gilbert Murray.

It happened after all
	

A jail term staring in the face of a onetime white collar bigwig sent several individuals with close ties to him into jitters and they soon swung into action. 

A rumour went viral soon afterwards that several politicos had been offered Rs.6 million each as inducement to use their influence to save the white collar bigwig in hot water.
A follow-up rumour said the politicos who accepted the inducements held a strong brief for the white collar bigwig at a meeting of a high-powered team that discussed the impending court case.
Nevertheless, what had to happen, happened after all, they say.

It was ideal grist to the opposition mill
	

The statement made by the battle-scarred hero now a purohita, attributing war crimes to a big one of the same tribe triggered a howl of angry protests from various quarters in the country and a highly ruffled Number One was compelled to publicly dissociate himself and yahapalanaya led by him from the serious allegation.

However, the beleaguered purohita made matters worse when he began hurling abuse at his detractors.
Seeing the situation taking a turn for the worse, the Top Two after holding a hurried council warned the purohita to shut his gab without causing further damage to the governments image when decisive polls are round the corner.
The purohita has gone silent after the warning, but the angry protests continue to plague the yahapalanaya leadership

NDB Wealth Regular Income Plan helping meet lifes milestones
	
No matter the financial goals one aspires to, whether it is buying a home or car, or paying to educate ones children, a Regular Income Plan from expert financial planner NDB Wealth is one of the best options for true success.
Achieving a goal is incredibly satisfying, and it is even better when you meet financial goals related to payments or income. So, if you are looking to make a down payment on a home or car, or go on a vacation you have always dreamed about, a Regular Income Plan takes care of it all, said NDB Wealth Financial Advisor Christina Wesley.
NDB Wealths Regular Income Plan allows the saver to withdraw a predetermined amount, at regular intervals, from an existing saving or investment account at NDB Wealth. These intervals can be monthly, quarterly and will be credited to your bank account on the date
specified by you.
Wesley added: The Regular Income Plan from NDB Wealth can also help you with a variety of ongoing financial commitments, from paying your monthly insurance premium, or your kids college tuition, to even securing your long term future by providing a steady retirement income.
The Regular Income Plan is so flexible it lets clients take out a part of the capital as well as income you make from it or, alternatively, only withdraw the income made on investments, enabling capital to stay invested.
Plans also have a number of other benefits, including being tax-free regular income (tax free in the hands of the investor). Additionally, there are no penalties or fees associated with the NDB Wealth Regular Income Plan, so you can withdraw all or part of your money, at any time. You can even start generating an income immediately by depositing today, and even increase or reduce the amount you withdraw later based on any new requirements. NDB Wealth also helps by facilitating periodic bill payments to third parties.
These plans are proving particularly useful in case of medical, or other, emergencies since you can take out all, or part, of your money, at any time. Without penalty or fee. However, if you remain disciplined, and stay true to the plan, the overall advantages you accrue are considerable.

No emergency repair work during strike: CEB union
	
No repair work will be carried in the case of a breakdown or power failure except at government hospitals, during the strike to be launched from noon today, Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) Workers Union said.
Union Secretary Ranjan Jayalal said the work stoppage was being resorted to in the absence of any government response for the workers' demands which include the salary revision from 1:6 to 1:9.
Addressing the media at the Centre for Society and Religion, he said the salary scales of administrative officers at the CEB had been increased on numerous occasions, but the salary scale of lower level employees had remained unchanged.
These increments had resulted in the salary ratio between the administrative staff and lower level employees widening from 1:9 from 1:6 in 2015, Mr. Jayalal said. If we do not receive a favourable response by September 15, we will continue with the strike.
Mr. Jayalal they expected the government to respond by noon on Friday and was adamant that special committees should not be appointed to resolve their issues.
The corruption within the CEB is larger than the recently concluded 'sil redi' case. Because of huge financial frauds the consumers have to pay higher bills to cover up the losses incurred by the fraud and corruption. As a Union we will not allow the government to increase the electricity bills by even a cent, he said. We had discussions with the subject minister and other officials and we did everything we could, hoping our demands will be met. We resorted to strike action because nothing happened. It is now the ministers turn to speak up and reveal to the public the burden of corruption palmed off to them by the higher levels of the CEB.
Mr. Jayalal said the union had no political or personal agendas and what they were looking for was a change in the salary ratio. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

## Title: NSB, EPF and SLIC dealers involved with PTL benefited as friends in a ring DSG
## Section: Breaking News
## Date: 13 September 2017 10:16 pm
NSB, EPF and SLIC dealers involved with PTL benefited as friends in a ring DSG
	
Deputy Solicitor General Milinda Gunatilleke observed today before the PCoI that dealers in the National Savings Bank (NSB), Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation (SLIC), the EPF and the DFCC (intermediary) who were involved in the process where Perpetual Treasuries Limited (PTL) sold bonds to Government Institutions in the Secondary Market were friends and benefited as part of a ring.
DSG Gunatilleke also played several voice recordings and cross-examined PTL CEO Kasun Palisena on PTLs transactions with its related companies (Perpetual Capital Holdings, W.M. & Mendis Co. and Perpetual Asset Management) as well.
Earlier, it was explained that theses inter-company transactions had resulted in capital gains transfers to other group companies, which are also owned ultimately by Arjun Aloysius.
In two voice recordings it shows that W.M. & Mendis Cos financial consultant was unaware about some transactions between PTL and W.M. & Mendis Co, and also the Chief Dealer of PTL, Nuwan Salgado and its back office head, Manjula also had faced difficulties in finding about several inter-company transactions.
Mr. Milinda Gunatilleke therefore said that the transactions reflected in the PTL documents provided to the Commission largely represent fictitious deals as it only mirrors how the money moved from one pocket of Arjun Aloysius to another.
He also said that some of these transactions were also a mystery to their own employees as reflected in the voice recordings.
When questioned by Justice Prasanna Jayawardena, PTL CEO Palisena said that all of the decisions had come through Arjun Aloysius to engage in transactions with its own group of companies.
DSG Gunatilleke then questioned the witness on PTLs transactions with NSB, SLIC and the EPF, which had been done through an intermediary (DFCC).
The names of the persons, who had handled these transactions in different institutions, were also revealed before the Commission. They are:
Nuwan Salgado- Chief Dealer PTL
Naveen Anuradha  Dealer NSB
Kaveen Karunaratne- Dealer DFCC (intermediary)
Dhanuka- Dealer SLIC
Saman Kumara- Dealer EPF
It was a selling process of Treasury Bonds from PTL to the aforementioned government institution in the secondary market directly and through an intermediary by PTL.
DSG Gunatilleke said that all these dealers (in NSB, DFCC, EPF, SLIC) were involved in the process as friends and benefited as part of a ring when PTL sold bonds to Government Institutions in the Secondary Market.
The DSG was of the view that the whole process was a racket which resulted in government institutions suffering huge losses.
Earlier it was said that these bonds had been sold to those Government institutions at a lower rate contrary to the prevailing yield rate in the market.
However, PTL CEO Palisena disagreed with the DSGs statement.
At this point, the DSG played another voice recording in which Palisena and DFCCs dealer Kaveen are in conversation.
In this conversation, Palisena tells DFCC dealer, Kaveen that PTLs finance department will call him to know all transactions done through DFCC to NSB by PTL. Palisena at the end of the conversation tells Kaveen: This is not for them but something for you.
DSG Gunatilleke and Justice Jayawardena explained it was about asking a figure in the transactions to give something to the dealer who acted as an intermediary in those transactions.
However, Palisena said he asked it with the purpose of evaluating PTLs transactions through DFCC.
Justice Jayawardena: Why would you be interested in getting DFCC details
Kasun Palisena: To promote transactions through the intermediary (switches) in the future.
At this comment by Palisena the Commissioners sarcastically smiled looking at each other.
DSG Gunatilleke also submitted the bonus payments and profit benefits paid to Kasun Palisena before the Commission and said they were much higher than the next highest paid in PTL.
It was also revealed that NSB dealer, Naveen Anuradha was once an employee of the CBSL EPF department.
It was also revealed that DFCC dealer Kaveen was a very good friend of Kasun Palisena.
When questioned by Justice Jayawardena it was explained by Palisena that Arjun Aloysius had known all of those dealers very well.
Justice Jayawardena: Did Naveen Anuradha work at EPF
Witness Palisena : Yes
J: What about SLIC dealer, Dhanuka
W: That I dont Know
J: Do you know that in 2013, when Perpetual Asset Management was selling bonds to the EPF, Naveen Anuradha was at the EPF as the dealer
W: That I dont know
J: Arjun Aloysius knows about all of these dealers, right
W: Yes
J: What about other individuals at the CBSL Public Debt Department would Arjun Aloysius know them as well
Witness was thinking
J: What about Sarathchandra in the PDD Would Aloysius know him
W: Yes, and Dhammika Nanayakkara.
J: What about Paduman
W: Yes
J: Could you think of high ranked individuals in the PDD whom Aloysius knew well
Witness was thinking again and said that he was not sure about that.
Cross examination of PTL CEO Kasun Palisena would continue today.
The PCoI comprising Justice K.T. Chitrasiri (Chairman), Justice Prasanna Jayawardena and K. Velupillai Kandasami will resume sittings at 10 am today. (Shehan Chamika Silva)

Over 12 million without power
	

By Joel Achenbach, Katie Zezima, Mark Berman, William Wan  (c) 2017, The Washington Post  Sep 12, 2017 - 
MIAMI - As Hurricane Irma dissipated into a tropical storm on Monday, Floridas residents emerged to streets littered with debris and downed trees while nearly two-thirds of the state was left without electricity. 
The once-powerful storm left trailer homes sliced open like ripe melons, boats tossed upside down on roadways and centuries-old trees strewn across power lines. As it trailed off on Monday, Irmas rains caused floodwaters to rise from Jacksonville, Florida, to Charleston, South Carolina, continuing to impact a massive area of the American southeast. 
But it could have been much worse. 
That was the grateful mantra on the lips of many on Monday, even as an estimated 12 million Floridians prepared for a dark night without air conditioning in the muggy post-storm swelter. 
The lack of electricity across most of South Florida was the most pressing and crippling problem. Millions could remain in the dark for days or even weeks as utility companies struggle to navigate impassable roads and floodwaters to slowly restore power. 
Waters in Jacksonville, in the states far northeast, sent residents scrambling to the top floors of their houses Monday morning. The St. Johns River, which cuts through the city, overflowed its banks, flooding bridges and streets. 
Rescuers used boats, water scooters and even surfboards to get to residents surprised by the rising waters, said Kimberly Morgan, a spokeswoman for the Clay County emergency center. You have to get creative in a situation like this, she said. 
Morgan said that evacuation shelters, which already held 700 people before Monday, were expected to fill up even more. 
We dont think were going to see the end of this until Friday, she said. 
Authorities warned that it was not yet safe for evacuated residents to return to their homes in many areas of Florida, the threat of floods still looming as rivers swell with rainwater and storm surges continue to send rising ocean waters into towns, especially in northern Florida. And state officials warned that another approaching storm, Hurricane Jose, is pushing still more water toward the northern part of the state.

Pakistan says US has not issued demands over Afghanistan
	

DAILY MAIL, 12 September, 2017-Pakistan has not received specific requests from the US to target alleged militant sanctuaries, Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi said Tuesday, as he vowed to tighten security along the border with Afghanistan. 
The premiers remarks come weeks after President Donald Trump lambasted Pakistan during a speech outlining US policy on Afghanistan, accusing Islamabad of hosting safe havens for insurgents who cross the border to attack Afghan and NATO forces. 
During a press conference Abbasi denied the accusations that Pakistan supported militants groups as he batted away suggestions that Trumps comments would upend relations between the Cold War allies.

We dont think the Pakistani-US relationship will be defined by Afghanistan, the prime minister told reporters in Islamabad. 
This relationship is 70 years old and cannot be redefined by one issue or it should not be redefined by one issue.

Peace pact for their mutual benefit
	

Two politicos in a certain area embroiled in a protracted rivalry had suddenly entered into a peace pact, they say. 

The twosome, a JO Diyawanna member and a provincial council member who met by chance at a funeral on their home turf the other day were the focus of the attention of the people at the funeral house for the bad blood between them was an open secret.
The JO Diyawanna member is a well-known racketeer engaged in activities such as illicit sand and gravel mining. The PC member, a typical opportunist, is an influential figure backing yahapalanaya.  
The people closely following the movements of the two politicos had expected them to avoid even eye contact with each other. However, to their surprise, the duo had greeted each other like long lost friends and were later seen engaged in an intimate conversation.
The pro-yahapalanaya PC member had during the conversation told the Diyawanna member: You carry on your business Theres no reason to worry
Two or three people who had overheard this remark made by the PC member had immediately put two and two together and decided it was an assurance given to the Diyawanna member that he could go ahead with his illicit sand and gravel mining activities without the fear of being troubled by the law enforcing authorities.

PTL earned phenomenal profits by selling at lower rates to EPF: DSG Gunatilleke
	
Senior Deputy Solicitor General Milinda Gunathileke said yesterday Perpetual Treasuries Ltd (PTL) would not have earned phenomenal profits in Treasury bond trading if it hadnt ultimately sold bonds, which had been bought from Primary Auctions, to the EPF and other Government institutions in the secondary market at a yield rate which was relatively low.
He made this observation when concluding the cross-examination of PTL CEO Kasun Palisena on the PTLs secondary market transactions.
During the cross-examination, it was explained that PTL had bought Rs.5 billion worth of bonds directly and through the Bank of Ceylon at the primary auction on February 27, 2015. Thereafter, part of those bonds had been sold to the EPF in June, 2015 in the secondary market.
It was also explained that PTL had bought those Treasury Bonds at a higher yield rate between 11.5 % and 12.27% at the February auction and subsequently sold them to the EPF in June at less than 10.5%. (This is at an advantage to PTL)
DSG Gunathileke also explained that PTL had bought Treasury Bonds from an auction in October 2015 at a higher yield rate and in the very next month sold them to the EPF at a lower yield rate through an intermediary (PABC) gaining considerably higher profits.
Comparing both instances, when PTL had sold bonds to EPF at a lower rate, in June and November, 2015, DSG Gunathileke explained that on both occasions PTL had in fact engaged in outright transactions with its other counter parties at higher yield rates which are not comparable to its sale rate with the EPF.
However, Mr. Palisena was of the view that PTL had not dealt with EPF at rates which prevailed in the market at that time. He said the other outright transactions mentioned by the DSG were actually not outright sales but a transaction mode called sell and buy back, which happens on an agreed buying back date when the parties involved enter into a transaction.
He said the sell and buy back took place at a different yield rate when compared with the prevailing rates in the market and therefore could not be taken into consideration when determining the markets prevailing yield rate at that time.
However, Justice Prasanna Jayawardena appeared unconvinced by the explanation given by the witness about the sell and buy back yield rates and repeatedly questioned Palisena about it.
He also questioned the witness based on the documents provided by PTL on its secondary market transactions and pointed out several transactions which were not apparently sell and buy back because of the differences reflected in the entering day of the transactions.
The witness was of the view that those sell and buy back transactions could have gone through a method called roll over with counter parties. Justice Jayawardena again appeared unconvinced with the answers given by the witness.
DSG Gunetilleke questioned the witness from where PTL had adopted the sell and buy back method, because the witness said those sell and buy back transactions were not similar to REPO transactions (which are frequently used in bond trading).
Mr. Gunetilleke was of the view that CBSL has no product called sell and buy back.
The witness said he was taught about it at a seminar conducted by ACCA over the potential of using such a method in their bond trading.
DSG Gunathileke was of the view that during the time period where PTL had sold bonds to the EPF in the secondary market at a lower yield rate, PTL had also engaged in outright sales with its counter parties at higher rates when compared with its sale rate to the EPF.
The DSG was of the view that PTL would not have gained significant profits if they had not sold bonds bought from primary auctions to the EPF at a lower rate.
PTL CEO Kasun Palisena will be re-examined by Nihal Fernando PC today. (Shehan Chamika Silva)

It is the top management of the Road Development Authority (RDA) that is behind the move to privatize or lease all the existing and the proposed highways, the Alliance to Protect the Trade Unions of Road Development Authority said yesterday.
Addressing a media conference, the convener of the alliance, Milton Wijesundara said the Cabinet approval had also been given in that regard and added they had not been informed about any action in connection with leasing or privatizing.
We dont say that all the officials in RDA are responsible for this action but those who are in the top are the ones who are promoting and taking the leadership in the move to privatize these precious resources to a company. We are opposed to these actions, Mr. Wijesundara said.
Meanwhile, an engineer Grani Jayalath revealed that the annual revenue of the three existing highways was Rs. 5 billion and that the current revenue was adequate to find the expenses for the maintenance of the highways in the future too.
When we have this amount of profit out of the three existing highways, there is no need of transferring the ownership of them or that of the proposed ones to a private company, Mr. Jayalath stressed.
He urged the government to desist from this arbitrary move which would badly affect the country's economy. (Sheain Fernandopulle)

Reading meaning into the unusual present!
	

A Diyawanna member of the political party dominating the countrys North had received a very unusual gift parcel from his party leader recently.

This party leader whose residence is located in an area far away from the city would on his return to Colombo bring with him some garden produce for distributing among his partys Diyawanna members.
The gift parcel that the particular Diyawanna member had received from his party leader upon his return from the East had given him much food for thought for it was a kind of popular vegetable in the North known to be rich in ginseng properties.
You, the readers, must be wondering as what could be the kind of vegetable that the Diyawanna member  by the way one with ties to a section of the media  had received as a present from his party leader.
It was a big bundle of drumsticks!

Residents return to Florida Keys as Irma death toll rises
	

Residents returned on Tuesday to parts of the Florida Keys archipelago that was hammered by Hurricane Irmas high winds and storm surge, while the death toll rose in the second major hurricane to hit the United States this year. 
Irma, which had rampaged through the Caribbean as one of the most powerful Atlantic hurricanes on record, was downgraded to a tropical depression on Monday and would likely dissipate from Tuesday evening, the National Hurricane Center said. 
At its peak the storm prompted evacuation orders for 6.5 million people in Florida, the largest evacuation in modern U.S. history. 
Irma killed 43 people in the Caribbean and at least 11 in Florida, Georgia and South Carolina. 
A local Florida official said there had been more deaths yet to be reported, particularly on the Florida Keys, where Irma arrived on Key Cudjoe as a Category 4 hurricane with sustained winds of up to 130 miles per hour (215 km per hour) on Sunday.

Robbery on Central Expressway not second to Bond scam: JO
	
The joint opposition (JO) yesterday said the government was attempting to commit a financial fraud not second to the Bond scam by handing over the construction of the Central Expressway to a consortium of two Japanese companies.
Addressing a news briefing, Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) Chairman Professor G.L. Peiris said the initial preparations were made to obtain funds for the construction of the Expressway from the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA).
Since the JICA is a firm of the Japanese Government, there will be no commissions. Therefore, the Mitsui Bank entered into the deal. Meanwhile, the government is trying its best to hand over the construction work of the highway to Fujita Corporation, he said.
He said a Technical Evaluation Committee appointed had ruled that the Fujita Corporation lacks adequate financial and technical knowledge to carry out the highway constructions.
The Committee said Fujita has no financial power as it had not undertaken a single project worth more than USD 600 million within the last five years. Then, the government roped in another company called Taisei Corporation which has technical skills. However, instead of rejecting Fujita, the government forced Taisei to establish a consortium with Fujita to construct the highway, Prof. Peiris said.
He said the Technical Committee had estimated the constructions of the Expressway could be carried out with Rs. 123 billion but the government expects to give Rs. 132.5 billion to the Corporations. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Rohingya militants:  Terrorists or freedom fighters
	

By Max Bearak 
(c) 2017, The Washington Post 
Sep 11, 2017 - 
Over the past 2 weeks, the coastal borderland between Myanmar and Bangladesh has become the site of almost incomprehensible misery and suffering. 
Around 300,000 people, most belonging to Myanmars Rohingya ethnic group, have fled with nothing but the clothes on their backs. They are escaping what many say is a scorched-earth campaign led by the Myanmar military to drive an unwanted, mostly Muslim minority from the country, complete with indiscriminate killing, systematic rape and the burning of entire towns. 
Despite the evidence - which by Monday had led the United Nations chief human rights officer to call the atrocities a textbook example of ethnic cleansing - the Myanmar military and government say they are not targeting civilians but rather a group of terrorists that claim to protect the Rohingya but are in fact militants bent on creating an Islamic state in southwest Myanmars Rakhine state. 
The situation calls to mind the adage: One mans terrorist is anothers freedom fighter. 
The Rohingya (pronounced Ro-hin-ja) have been referred to as the worlds most friendless people and are undoubtedly in need of protection. For decades they have faced persecution and been denied citizenship in Buddhist-majority Myanmar, which is also known as Burma. With the countrys democratic reforms in 2011, ending half a century of military rule, many hoped the Myanmar government led by Aung San Suu Kyi, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate and self-proclaimed pacifist would provide that protection. 
But Suu Kyi has no direct control over Myanmars military under the new constitution. And she also subscribes to the belief held by many in Myanmar that the Rohingya are essentially illegal Bangladeshi interlopers, despite evidence of their presence in the region for generations, if not centuries. The Myanmar government officially refers to the group as Bengali.  Until recently, Bangladeshis felt similarly about the Rohingya. Bangladeshis once had hatred for us, a Rohingya man named Mohammed Yunus told The New York Times earlier this year. But now they have the idea that we are persecuted. 
That idea has spread far and wide, especially among Muslims around the world. Images and testimony shared by Rohingya have galvanized people from Chechnya to Jakarta to come out in mass protest against Myanmars treatment of the Rohingya. Bangladesh now hosts 750,000 Rohingya refugees, and the government in Dhaka recently described Myanmars actions as genocide. Only international pressure could persuade Myanmar to accept most of the refugees back, given that almost none would hold Myanmar citizenship. 
According to an investigation by the International Crisis Group published last December, the plight of the Rohingya has also inspired wealthy individuals in Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and elsewhere to fund a ragtag insurgency.
When the report came out, the fledgling Rohingya militancy was known as Harakah al-Yaqin, Arabic for faith movement. The group now calls itself the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army, or (ARSA).  Money and weapons are channeled through groups of Rohingya expatriates living in the Persian Gulf and Bangladesh and eventually reach Myanmar, where local fighters receive training. The ICG report says that ARSA has growing popular support among Rohingya in Myanmar, but the recent crackdown was sparked by a co-ordinated Arsa attack on nine Myanmar border police posts that killed at least 12 officers last month. On the other hand, the crackdown may inspire many Rohingya to join the militants.  Still, calling the conflict between the military and ARSA lopsided would be an understatement. ARSA likely has a only a few hundred fighters. There is little evidence that foreigners have joined the fight. On Sunday, ARSA declared a unilateral cease-fire, hoping to assuage the humanitarian crisis. The Myanmar government refused to enter into talks with them.  The Rohingya remain deeply unpopular in Myanmar, but ARSAs attacks, even if they pale in comparison to Myanmars retaliation, only widen the divisions and serve the governments narrative. With the Myanmar military essentially treating all Rohingya men as possible terrorists, and effectively blocking humanitarian aid, the vicious spiral of persecution and militarization is in full spin.

The importance of listening to language
	
Wimal Abeysundera is closely associated with the Colombo School of Poets that had a profound impact on Sinhala poetry mainly during the period from 1940 to 1970.There was much poetry written during this period. Admittedly, much of the poetry written during this period is mediocre. However there were poets like Wimalaratna Kumaragama and Sagara Palansuriya who wrote poetry worthy of serious consideration. Wimal Abeysundera distinguished himself from most other Colombo poets by his deep knowledge of Sinhala, Pali, Sanskrit and his intimate acquaintance with Buddhist thought. 
One feature that marks Wimal Abeusunderas poetry is its display of a Buddhist consciousness. It inflects his themes, tropes, and vision. When we examine his poetry we see that it is closely related to Buddhist thought and Buddhist sensibility. It is evident that in his poetry he has been inspired by traditional Buddhist narratives. Among his interesting poetic compositions are retellings of traditional Buddhist narratives. He has also recreated vividly various sites of Buddhist worship which generate in the reader a sense of awe and reverence. In addition Abeysundera has sought to recreate the power and glory of diverse Buddhist personalities that have a relevance to the generality of readers. Most Importantly, Abeysundera was keen on displaying the continuing relevance of Buddhist understandings, values, norms and outlook for contemporary society. 
Heidegger subscribed to an extreme form of this constitutive theory of language. He said that it isnt man that speaks language, but language that speaks through man. He asserted that, We dont merely speak the language. We have already listened to language. What do we hear
In order to understand the true significance of Abeysunderas poetry we need to pay closer attention to Buddhist values. As a consequence of the forces of modernization and globalization the face of society is changing rapidly. This has profound consequences on the values and norms that guide our lives.
Abeysundera was clearly perturbed by the inimical and destructive forces unleashed by the consumer society. The imperative of the consumer is everywhere and he views with alarm the corrosive effect it has on the day to day lives of people. In order to counteract these unhealthy forces, Abeysundera, through his poetry, has sought to underscore the importance and relevance of Buddhist values. This indeed constitutes an important facet of his poetry. 
In addition to his poetry, Abeysundera has written a number of important critical essays that deal with the discourse of poetry as well as the distinguishing features of the poetry produced by the Colombo School. Some of these critical essays offer us many significant insights in to the ambitions, preferred pathways, agendas and visions of this group of poets. He does so based on his intimate experiences with this group of poets. 
As I stated earlier, a significant feature that serves to differentiate Abeysundera from many other poets belonging to the Colombo School is the vast linguistic resources he had at is command. His fluency in Sinhala, Pali and Sanskrit stood him in good stead. This verbal facility is intimately linked to what I think is an important concept on poetic discourse, namely, the distinct ability to listen to language. The ability to listen to language sensitively and purposefully, it seems to me, is a mark of a good poet. 
The phrase listening to language was put into wider circulation by the German philosopher Martin Heidegger. He is, to be sure, a controversial figure. His flirtation with Nazism for a short period of time permanently tarnished his reputation. At the same time, most esteemed philosophers regard him very highly. Some even claim that he was the most original thinker of the twentieth century. He had important things to say about a variety of topics including language and poetry.
As I stated earlier, a significant feature that serves to differentiate Abeysundera from many other poets belonging to the Colombo School is the vast linguistic resources he had at is command. His fluency in Sinhala, Pali and Sanskrit stood him in good stead
To my mind, Heideggers approach to language merits very close attention, especially if those of us are deeply interested in poetry. His favourite poet was the German poet Holderlin. He had very many interesting observations to make about Holderlins poetry and the intricate ways in which language works in and through his poems. It seems that we in Sri Lanka havent paid adequate attention to Heideggers specific views on language and poetry. 
As I stated earlier Heidegger was responsible for putting into wider circulation the idea of listening to language and its compelling significance in order to understand the true important of this idea. Let us first explore in broad outline martin Heideggers approach to language or as he would prefer to say path to language. As he sees it, there are two broad approaches to language, instrumental and constitutive. The first seeks to encircle the fact that language is an instrument of communication, that we exchange ideas, thoughts and opinions that are re-formed through the medium of language.
Those who subscribe to this view believe that language can be understood within a picture of life. This means that language arises from within this framework, but the framework itself operated independently of, or prior to, language. The constitutive approach, on the other hand, states emphatically that language is no mere instrument of thought, but rather that it is constitutive of thought. Here language becomes pivotal to thought formation. Heidegger subscribed to an extreme form of this constitutive theory of language.
He said that it isnt man that speaks language, but language that speaks through man. He asserted that, We dont merely speak the language. We have already listened to language. What do we hear We hear language speaking. His central trope of language was that of a house of being. This encapsulates ably the essence of his thinking on language. He was of the opinion that it wasnt possible for us to step outside language, because human beings was inescapably within language already. Heidegger isnt interested in the surface phenomena of language, the communication that transpires within a context that is already fashioned, but rather in the manner in which language makes that very context possible. He once remarked that, only when there is language is there a world. 
In order to understand Heideggers constitutive approach to language, we need to pay close attention to the way he commented upon admiringly on Holderlins poetry. The language of poetry, for him, was of paramount importance. The significance of poetry for Heidegger resides in the fact that it reproduces the original moment before speech. This original moment is marked by our willingness to allow language to speak to us. In an essay titled language in the poem, which deals with the poetry of Georg Traki, Heidegger remarked that, the dialogue of thinking with poetry aims to call for the nature of language, so that mortals may learn to live with language again. What he is stating here is that in the poem language should be regarded as an opening to language, and it is only by listening to language that we can situate ourselves in the very existence of the world. 
One feature that marks Wimal Abeusunderas poetry is its display of a Buddhist consciousness. It inflects his themes, tropes, and vision.
What this discussion about Heideggers attitude to language and his vision of poetry tells us about our own endeavours to study Sinhala poetry in terms of the uniqueness if a given language and its intersections of phonetic and syntactic structured are the following; language should be seen as constitutive of meaning, nothing happens outside language, we operate within specified linguistic universes, the uniqueness of languages and their respective and informing acoustic patterns merit very close study. These observations have a pointed relevance to Abeysunderas poetry. He was sensitive to languages; he listened to language much more intently than most other Colombo school poets. 
Distinguished English critic Graham Hough, in his book on essays, makes the point that each language, whether it be English or German or Chinese, has its own distinctive phonetic and semantic features which demand close attention.
These features could constitute a useful basis for the productive exploration into the complexities of the poetic experience and the nature of poetry. Similarly George Steiner, in many of his critical essays, has drawn attention to the lexical, syntactic, phonetic features of different languages and what this means to the understanding of poetry.
As I stated earlier Heidegger was responsible for putting into wider circulation the idea of listening to language and its compelling significance in order to understand the true important of this idea.
This linguistic uniqueness, in my judgment, can become a useful point of departure in investigating the defining and constitutive features of poetry. Perceptive poets are sustained by the conviction that recognition of the uniqueness of his or her linguistic terrain is a prelude to poetic achievement. Abeysundera was deeply aware of this fact. 
What I have sought to achieve in this short essay, then, is to focus on the constitutive theory of language and the imperative need to listen to language as a way of illuminating an important facet of Abeysunderas poetry. Poems contained in a book, such as the Manasa, illustrates this point forcefully. This is all the more important in view of the fact that much of the poetry written today displays a conspicuous lack of this desire to listen to language intently, to hear language speaking to us.

The new iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus
	
At its annual September iPhone event, which took place on September 12, Apple unveiled three new iPhones: the iPhone 8, the iPhone 8 Plus, and the iPhone X. While the iPhone X is the new high-end flagship device, the iPhone 8 and the iPhone 8 Plus both feature some major improvements.


Like the iPhone X, the iPhone 8 and the iPhone 8 Plus feature an all-glass design, with new aluminum-framed glass bodies available in Space Gray, Gold, and Silver. Apple uses a seven-layer color process for "precise" hue and opacity, and the devices are constructed from the most durable glass ever used in a smartphone.
Aside from the glass design, the two new devices are otherwise nearly identical to the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus, available in 4.7 (iPhone 8) and 5.5-inch (iPhone 8 Plus) size options with Touch ID and standard bezels. Both the iPhone 8 and the iPhone 8 Plus are IP67 water and dust resistant, and the speakers in the device are 25 percent louder with deeper bass.
New Retina HD displays have been added, with support for True Tone to match the color of the display to the ambient lighting for a more natural paper-like viewing experience. The display is the same brightness as the display in the iPhone 7 and continues to offer cinema-standard wide color gamut.
A new A11 Bionic chip features a six-core CPU design with two performance cores that are 25 percent faster and four efficiency cores that are 70 percent faster than the A10 Fusion chip in previous-generation devices.
Apple is introducing a new second-generation performance controller that's able to harness all six of the cores at the same time, for 70 percent better performance for multi-threaded workloads. The A11 Bionic also includes a three-core GPU that's up to 30 percent faster than the previous-generation GPU.
There's an improved 12-megapixel rear camera in the iPhone 8, with a dual-camera setup again available in the iPhone 8 Plus. Both models feature larger and faster sensors, a new color filter, and deeper pixels. With a new image signal processor, there's advanced pixel processing, wide color capture, faster autofocus in low light, and better HDR photos.
A new quad LED True Tone Flash with Slow Sync provides more uniformly lit backgrounds and foregrounds when using the flash.
When it comes to video, the camera can capture 4K video up to 60fps and 1080p slo-mo up to 240fps. A new video encoder offers up real-time image and motion analysis for better quality video.
On the iPhone 8 Plus, there's a new Portrait Lightning feature available for Portrait Mode, which is designed to allow iPhone users to add studio lighting effects to Portrait photos.
The iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus have been designed with augmented reality experiences in mind. Each camera features individual calibration with new gyroscopes and accelerometers for more accurate motion tracking.
With their glass bodies, the iPhone 8 and the iPhone 8 Plus support Qi-based inductive wireless charging and are able to charge using a range of Qi-supported charging mats.
The iPhone 8 and the iPhone 8 Plus are available in 64 and 256GB capacities, with pricing starting at $699 for the iPhone 8 and $799 for the larger iPhone 8 Plus.
Apple plans to begin accepting pre-orders for the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus on September 15, with the devices seeing an official launch on September 22.

Their patience has begun wearing thin!
	

Purohitas and the members reportedly set to cross the great divide are said to be receiving phone calls from the palace almost on a daily basis.

And all these calls convey an earnest request to them: Be patient at least for another three months. These calls have produced some effect on at least three purohitas for they have decided to rethink the decisive step they were about to take and have stopped spitting venom at the government, they say.
However, according to informed sources, all others in the dissident group stand firm on the decision to quit
Meanwhile, the JO members waiting with open arms to welcome the defectors have got irked by the latters dilly-dallying. For instance, the fire-breathing lady from the gem city area has insisted that she be given the partys district leadership for they have waited long enough for the senior one from the district to take the plunge, they say.

The former tuition master, now the JOs economic whizkid, called on the purohita currently handling finance to air a grievance of his.

The former tuition master told the purohita: I started work on a film at the time your government did not spare the film industry too from high taxes. I used all resources available  in fact  I had to scrape the bottom- to finish the work on the film. However, yahapalanaya turning its back on the solemn promise given to promote a free media banned my film when it was about to be released. Dont you think this is quite wrong amethithuma 
The purohita handling the finance portfolio replied: We dont believe in banning films By the way what is the film you are talking about
Its the one based on the murder of journalist Richard de Soysa!
Ah! Why should we ban the film replied the purohita. Go ahead with the arrangements to screen it. By the way cant you add another episode to the story of your film
On what
On the murder of Lasantha Wickramatunga!
How to weave two different stories into one! said the former tuition master after a moments silence. However, he bade adieu to the purohita without pressing his point, they say.

Will Harvey  and Irma  be a wake-up call
	

By  Jennifer Rubin  
(c) 2017, The Washington Post 
The Miami Herald reported last week: 
Speaking from Miamis Emergency Operations Center in downtown, where the citys senior public safety and political authorities will ride out Category 4 Hurricane Irma this weekend, [Republican] Mayor Toms Regalado told the Miami Herald that he believes warming and rising seas are threatening South Floridas immediate and long-term future. 
This is the time to talk about climate change. This is the time that the president and the EPA and whoever makes decisions needs to talk about climate change, said Regalado, who flew back to Miami from Argentina Friday morning to be in the city during the storm. If this isnt climate change, I dont know what is. This is a truly, truly poster child for what is to come. 
The mayor is on firm scientific ground. Last year, Scientific American reported: The Florida cities and counties grappling with the effects of climate change have been skillful at identifying issues they must address in the immediate future, said [Ben] Kirtman, the University of Miami scientist. Hes seeing a turning point from previous discussions, where there might have been too much conversation about gloom and doom and a focus on what will happen in 2100, instead of in peoples lifetimes. The sea levels rising. Its clear, he said. Theres no indication whatsoever in the next 25 years that that trend is going to change. Theres nothing. You can argue until youre blue in the face whether its man or its because of natural cycles. But that doesnt matter. So they have to deal with it. They recognize it. Lets put it this way: If Republicans opposed building codes designed to withstand more intense hurricanes, theyd be run out of town the next time a hurricane ripped through town. If politicians in Louisiana, which between 1932 and 2010 lost more than 1,800 square miles of coastland to a myriad of factors, including sea level rise, subsidence (land settling or sinking), and oil industry development, did not support a master coastal plan to prevent literally losing their state, theyd be booted out as well. (Thats why the 2017 plan aimed at combatting the effects of rising sea levels passed the state legislature unanimously.) And yet Republicans from Texas (both U.S. senators and a slew of congressmen), Florida (most especially Gov.
Rick Scott and Sen. Marco Rubio), Alabama and Louisiana, among other locales, refuse to acknowledge the clear cause of rising sea levels and temperatures that add to the destructiveness of hurricanes that devastate their states. The GOP pols like to dodge the question by saying they are not climate scientists - and then refuse to accept the findings of 97 percent of the scientific community. Bluntly put, theyd rather cling to their know-nothingism than take steps to abate a known danger to their states. How is that any different from refusing to build levees and pumps or update building standards (Of course, the climate-change denier in chief did cancel a flood regulation that took account of global warming, something he should be asked about when he goes for his next photo op.) 
Perhaps these lawmakers will never change their minds, given how afflicted they are with the tribalism of the GOP. Apparently, they have no future in a party if they think clearly and dispassionately about the subject. But the voters of the states they represent shouldnt tolerate such recklessness. If Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, refused to vote for Harvey hurricane relief, hed surely lose reelection in 2018, yet he plans to stand for reelection firmly opposed to the science and remedial action that could save lives and property. Its remarkable that Cruz and others can look voters in the eye and refuse to take measures that would ameliorate their suffering and the suffering of generations to come. In 2015, former secretary of state George Shultz reviewed a batch of data about warming waters, sea levels and melting snow caps and glaciers. He wrote: These are simple and clear observations, so I conclude that the globe is warming and that carbon dioxide has something to do with that fact.
Those who say otherwise will wind up being mugged by reality. He reasoned, We all know there are those who have doubts about the problems presented by climate change. But if these doubters are wrong, the evidence is clear that the consequences, while varied, will be mostly bad, some catastrophic. So why not, he figured, take out an insurance policy Move to clean energy, invest in more R&D and consider a carbon tax. And, I would add, return to the voluntary restrictions the United States agreed to as part of the Paris climate agreement. (Its not as though coal is coming back, no matter what Trumps Environmental Protection Agency does.) 
Its time we started treating climate-change denial as a menace to public safety. The voters in states most immediately affected by climate-change deniers recklessness and who bear the brunt of their representatives willful scientific illiteracy should give state and federal politicians a choice: Give up the climate-change denial, or make way for someone who will be willing to take out some insurance for the sake of future hurricane victims.

## Title: Will the Chinese build a colony  in Sri Lanka

Will the Chinese build a colony  in Sri Lanka
	
China emerging as a big player among the global investors in Sri Lanka raises concerns which the island nation should reflect on closely. 
As much as Sri Lanka needs to keep ends warm with India, the same approach is needed in its dealings with China, the biggest investor in the island. A huge work force from China is at present on Sri Lankan soil. They are at present working along with Sri Lankans at work sites and only time will tell whether the islanders will adopt the work ethics and commitment shown by the Chinese, when given a task. 
When expatriate workers seek employment they also consider other factors like entertainment
	But there are concerns that a prolonged stay by the Chinese here may give rise to the establishment of a Chinese colony
	The cultural upbringings of the people of these two nations will serve as a yardstick that will help maintain a working relationship between the two work forces
The two nations share similarities and its wise to assume that Sri Lanka can benefit greatly through its dealings with the country thats led by Xi Jinping- a leader who isnt a dictator and one who values diplomacy and harmony. President Maithripala Sirisena also subscribes to these philosophies when governing a country. Both presidents know that the people of the two nations are fond of tea and their rice. But more than that President Sirisena is certainly aware of the fact that China has great interest in our ports, given that the nation with the highest population in the world is hell bent on investing on potential naval bases along the Indian Ocean. 
When expatriate workers seek employment they also consider other factors like entertainment. Weve heard so much about expatriates having illegitimate wives and children in the countries they find employment in. We had enough examples of this during the times of the British rule in Sri Lanka. 
Some people have raised such concerns already. Two people getting together to copulate or genuinely raise a family is their choice. But there are concerns that a prolonged stay by the Chinese here may give rise to the establishment of a Chinese colony. We shouldnt forget that the Hambantota Port has been leased out to the Chinese Government for 99 years. That agreement is in black and white and Sri Lanka cant go back on the word given by them to the Chinese Government. 
Now what we can hope for is that the cultural upbringings of the people of these two nations will serve as a yardstick that will help maintain a working relationship between the two work forces representing the two nations. 
We all know that the menfolk who go abroad for employment enjoy certain liberties. This is when cultural values and religion play a major role in disciplining an individual. 
Some believe that the Chinese have no religion. But a peep into their history reveals that like us Sri Lankans they too practise three religions common to both nations: Buddhism, Christianity and Islam. Like the islanders the Chinese too allow astrology and the match-maker to play a huge role in marriage. So its quite unlikely that a Chinese, like any Westerner coming here for employment, will raise an illegitimate family with a Sri Lankan female. A Chinese will think twice before getting in to a marriage and consider many aspects when compared to a European put in that position. 
The Chinese made their presence felt in Sri Lanka during the times of the Rajapakse regime. That was the time when the islanders got the taste of driving on expressways, thanks to Chinas expertise on road construction. No country shows a liking to another country without reason. The Chinese constructed the Nelum Pokuna as a gift to Sri Lanka. But we have to observe the issues China is faced with like the slow growth in their economy, reaching industrial overcapacity, imbalance in development, the income disparity and the territorial disputes with neighbours in the South and East China seas. 
It just goes to highlight the potential Sri Lanka has as a stopover point in the Indian Ocean which is why China got ahead of India in extending a helping hand in developing one of Sri Lankas ports. But this doesnt mean that the Sri Lankan authorities should allow the Chinese work force here to do as they wish and threaten cultures and practices and disturb the peaceful way of living here in the island. 
Sri Lanka is handicapped with a weakened economy at present and is desperate to attract foreign investors. The islands poor economic situation is the result of spending heavily to finish off a three-decade war against separatist Tiger rebels. The Government of Sri Lanka shouldnt compromise on this hard-earned peace by opening the doors for an expatriate community to build a mini empire here.
