A leading figure in yahapalanaya the other day called on a prominent religious dignitary in the city. Civilities over, the political high up came to the purpose of his visit. 
“Reverend Sir, I hope you will not mind if I make a request to you!”
“Of course, not. What is it?” the prelate asked.
“I know that you are a close friend of our former leader.  Please ask him not to create problems for our political party by giving unnecessary recognition and encouragement to other minor parties!” the political high up said.
The prelate had replied after a brief silence: “True, he is a friend. But how can I intercede in a controversial political issue like this? Don’t you think that this is an issue you should resolve by consultation among yourselves within the party?”
