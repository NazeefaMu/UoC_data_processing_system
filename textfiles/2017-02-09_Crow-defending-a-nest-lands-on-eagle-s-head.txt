This set of hilarious photographs capture the moment a black crow circles an eagle and then lands on its head.

Judging by the pictures, it is quite clear the bird of prey is not too pleased with its unwanted guest crashing down onto it over and over again.

The encounter was spotted in Tamilnadu, India. The eagle was sitting close to a nest, which the crow was trying to defend.

'The short-toed snake eagle was perched on a branch near the nest and the crow was trying to chase him away.'  (Daily Mail)
