About 800 kilograms of cocaine with an estimated value of Rs.12 billion was detected on board an Indian-bound vessel docked in the Colombo Harbour today following a tip off received by the Police Narcotics Bureau (PNB).

DIG Ajith Rohana told a news conference that the cocaine which was concealed inside a container loaded with teak logs was reportedly the largest quantity of cocaine detected so far in Sri Lanka and the South Asia.

“The ship was bound to India from Ecuador via Colombo. The ship, ss Fabiola had left Ecuador on October 2 and had reached Belgium on October 20 and was said to be on its way to India through a circuitous sea route,” he said.

The raid was carried out by 30 PNB personnel led by PNB Director SSP Kamal Silva under the directions of Police Chief Pujith Jayasundera and DIG Nandana Munasinghe. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)
