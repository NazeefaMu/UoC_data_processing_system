FTA with S'pore: GMOA wants to brief President


	

The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) has written to President Maithripala Sirisena seeking a meeting with him before its token strike on Thursday to discuss the detrimental factors in Free Trade Agreement (FTA) signed with Singapore.

GMOA Secretary Haritha Aluthge said the contents of the agreement had not been disclosed to the Cabinet and the country and that there were regulatory issues in various employment sectors without the necessary safety measures.

The GMOA condemned the Government’s decision to sign FTAs with Singapore and the Economic and Technology Co-operation Agreement (ETCA) with India outside a national policy.

Dr. Aluthge said was unfortunate that the foreign consultants preparing these agreements are deciding the country’s fate.

Meanwhile, the GMOA Executive Committee had decided to continue with its work stoppage on May 17 and an indefinite strike if the President failed to intervene.

GMOA Assistance Secretary Samantha Ananda challenged Development Strategies and International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrama to reveal the truth about the Singapore FTA to the public. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
