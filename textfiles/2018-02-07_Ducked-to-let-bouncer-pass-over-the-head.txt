The big boss in yahapalanaya at his recent election rally in the gem city extended an open invitation to the Pohottuwa faction team up with the Betel leaf group to form a government of their own.

 


Intrigued by this invitation on the eve of an election, the former strongman had phoned up the friendly senior purohita based in the gem city to inquire into the nitty-gritties of the invitation. 


The senior purohita had explained that a group of 20 members had given an undertaking to throw in their lot with the Betel leaf in the event of the two factions getting together to make up the headcount of 96 and the big boss had made the invitation on the strength of the undertaking given by the group of 20. 


The former strongman had greeted this explanation with a derisive guffaw and quipped: “That’s yet another bouncer given the election is close at hand!”
