Maithri to strive for SLFP govt. with MR, CBK


	

President Maitripala Sirisena, addressing the Nuwara Eliya district committee of the SLFP yesterday, said that he would strive to form a government led by the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) and include former presidents Mahinda Rajapaksa and Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga in it.
He said he would team up with all possible forces to form such a government.
He said his team would never leave room for the party to split, and, if any other group tried to split it, the people would take note of it.
He said aggressive behaviour and short political talks with various parties would not help to form a government.
The president said certain elements, who threatened to break ranks with the SLFP-led the UPFA and form different political fronts, were doing a great injustice to the party.
He said votes from the Sinhala Buddhists alone would not suffice for an electoral victory and, therefore, there would be an action plan to win over the Tamil and Muslim voters.
Besides, he said, a programme for containing corruption and fraud was also needed to win the people over to the party at the elections. (Amil Priyankara)
