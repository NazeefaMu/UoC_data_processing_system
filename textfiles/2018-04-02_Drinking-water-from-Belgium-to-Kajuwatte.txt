Increasing numbers suffering from various ailments connected with kidney are reported very often from the dry zone of the island. Many residents in the villages and some parts of new – colonization schemes in Polonnaruwa, Anuradhapura and Kurunegala districts have the repeated complaints connected with the non-availability of drinking water.

 


"Many voluntary social-service organizations have constructed drinking water projects in many colonization areas. Each project supplying drinking water for about 300 – 400 families will cost little over two million rupees."



The little quality of water available in the cultivation wells or drinking water wells is not suitable for drinking. Nevertheless, in the absence of any better – clearer water, they continue to drink whatever is available. Unavoidable result is kidney ailment.
The central government and the local provincial authority often take actions to distribute pure water transported in bowsers.
Anyhow, this arrangement cannot continue forever. Many voluntary social-service organizations have constructed drinking water projects in many colonization areas. Each project supplying drinking water for about 300 – 400 families will cost little over two million rupees.
