Diyawanna seat too is to be restored to him


	



 

The government authorities in the highest echelons are inundated with requests these days regarding filling the vacant Lands portfolio and the national list seat, they say.

 


The most pressing requests have come from the family of a yahapalanaya purohita.


This purohita who was among the first to raise the battle cry for yahapalanaya has urged that the Field Marshall be nominated to fill the vacant national list Diyawanna seat and also be appointed to the vacant portfolio. However, the purohita’s son, now a Diyawanna member, has insisted that a certain Soysa be offered the vacant Diyawanna seat in accord with a pre-election agreement signed with the Green party and he be appointed to the vacant portfolio. This has, incidentally, led to a dispute between the duo living under the same roof.


Meanwhile, the Big Boss and the second in command of yahapalanaya have reportedly decided on the Field Marshall as the best choice for the vacant national list Diyawanna seat. So the much respected old soldier is expected to return to Diyawanna wearing a new mantle shortly.
