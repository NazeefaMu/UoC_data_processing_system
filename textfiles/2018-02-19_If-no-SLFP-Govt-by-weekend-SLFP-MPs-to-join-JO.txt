SLFP National Organizer Minister Susil Premajayantha has informed former President Mahinda Rajapaksa on Friday (16) that unless the President takes steps to form a government sans members of the UNP by the end of the week, 15 SLFP ministers and parliamentarians including himself would be willing to join the joint opposition.

He gave this promise during a meeting he had with the former president at his official residence at Wijerama Mawatha in Colombo.

He said that the present 'Yahapalana' government had lost the people’s mandate and therefore should cease to exist.

In response, former President Rajapaksa had said he would welcome all of them into the fold. (Nalaka Sanjeewa Dahanayaka)
