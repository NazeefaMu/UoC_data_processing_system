AIA Lanka 3Q net soars amid higher premiums and investment income
	
AIA Insurance Lanka PLC (AIA), the local unit of Asia-based AIA Group Limited, saw its September quarter net profits (3Q16) soaring 45 percent to Rs.79.2 million from a year ago as the life business premiums rose and the income from its investment portfolio increased amid rising interest rates, the interim financialaccounts showed.
The earnings per share rose to Rs.2.57 from Rs.1.78 a year ago.
The gross written premiums (GWPs) rose over 15 percent year-on-year (YoY) to Rs.2.57 billion.
Further, the investment income rose 23 percent from a year ago to Rs.1.22 billion as the market interest rates were on an upward pressure during the period. 
The AIA Insurance Lanka group had a financial assets base of Rs.41 billion by the end of September 30.
AIA Group Limited, the third largest Asia-based insurer by market value, entered the Lankan market in December 2012 by acquiring 92.7 percent of the then AVIVA NDB Insurance in a deal valued at US $ 109 million.
In October 2015, the company divested its fully-owned general insurance subsidiary, AIA General Insurance Lanka Limited, to Janashakthi Insurance PLC for a consideration of Rs.3.2 billion to fully concentrate on life business.
AIA Insurance Lanka is the third largest life insurer in Sri Lanka based on GWPs. However, countrys life insurance penetration level stands just above 0.5 percent of the gross domestic product based on GWPs. 
The Hong Kong stock exchange listed life insurance giant, which already has presence in 18 Asian markets, further bets its future growth on increasing disposable incomes, powerful demographic and urbanization trends and very low insurance penetration rates in the region.
China is the second biggest market for AIA Group based on the Value of New Businesses (VONB).
Meanwhile, during the quarter AIA Insurance Lanka paid Rs.1.13 billion as net claims and benefits.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the company posted a net profit of Rs.198.7 million or Rs.6.46 a share, recording an increase of 40 percent from the same period last year.
The surplus of the life insurance business is reported annually at the year end and is therefore not included in the profit reported during interim periods in the year.
The GWPs for the same period rose 22 percent YoY to Rs.7.42 billion. Investment income grew 24 percent YoY to Rs.3.51 billion. The company paid Rs.3.47 billion worth of net claims and benefits.
AIA Group had a 97.16 percent stake in AIA insurance Lanka PLC as of September 30, 2016.

2017 Budget -- Deficit bridged with taxes, loans and fine
	
The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) said today, the 2017 Budget based on the conditions imposed by the International Monetary Fund, had pushed the people from the frying pan to the fire.
Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake has assured the IMF that the government would take steps to reduce the budget deficit by imposing taxes, JVP MP Vijitha Herath said and added that the
JVP was opposed to this anti-people budget and would vote against it in Parliament.
Mr. Herath said the Government had no option other than obtaining loans, imposing taxes and fines to bridge the budget deficit.
The present government is also placing the country in a debt trap just like what the Rajapaksa regime did. The government hopes to obtain Rs.390 billion from the new taxes introduced in the 2017 budget and about Rs.230 billion was from the tax on goods and services, he said.
Mr. Herath said the government had no plans to increase State revenue by increasing production but instead had burdened the people.
The government has inconvenienced the people by imposing new taxes such as carbon tax on vehicles and airport tax and much more, he said adding that the allocation for education and health had also been reduced considerably in the budget.
The allocation for health was reduced from Rs.174 billion to Rs.160 billion and the allocation for education from Rs.171 billion to Rs.76.9 billion when compared with this year's budget. The allocation for higher education has been reduced from Rs.171 billion to Rs. 63 billion, he said.
Mr. Herath said the government had hoodwinked the people by reducing prices of certain goods while taxing them on others.
The total price reduction is Rs.67 but the government is taking it back on just a one phone call. The government charging about Rs.50 from a Rs.100 phone card, he said. (Ajith Siriwardana)

ComBank September profit up 14% on loan growth but margins come under pressure
	
Sri Lankas largest private sector commercial bank by assets, Commercial Bank of Ceylon PLC (ComBank) increased its net profit for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 (3Q16) by 13.5 percent to Rs.3.69 billion or Rs.3.71 a share from a year ago, amid relatively strong growth in the loan book though the margins came under pressure, the interim financial accounts showed.
The ComBank share ended 60 cents or 0.41 percent higher at Rs.148 at yesterdays
market close.
The net interest income (NII) rose by a moderate 7 percent to Rs.8.22 billion as the rise in the interest expenses outweighed the
corresponding income.
The bank on a standalone basis expanded its loan book by 13 percent or Rs.67 billion during the nine months  little under Rs.7.5 billion a month  to a total of Rs.593 billion. 
Rupee overdrafts rose by Rs.14.6 billion, leases by Rs.1.4 billion, credit cards by Rs.1.0 billion and housing loans by Rs.4.9 billion during the period. Meanwhile, the deposits rose by 14 percent or Rs.86.4 billion to Rs.624.1 billion but the low-cost deposits base  current and savings account ratio (CASA)  fell to 44.5 percent from 49.7 percent in
December 2015.
The bank has an asset base of Rs.953.3 billion, up 8.4 percent during the nine months.
The net interest margin (NIM) slipped to 3.53 percent, which is about the industry average from 3.62 percent in December 2015 as the rise in deposit rates outweighed the loan rates.
The net fee and commission income rose by a healthy 35 percent year-on-year (YoY) to
Rs.1.8 billion.
However, the bank made a loss of Rs.238.4 million from its trading book against a gain of Rs.926.3 million a year ago.
However, the unrealized gains on the banks financial assets under the available-for-sale category turned in a profit Rs.1.93 billion from a loss of Rs.3.5 billion during the same quarter
last year.
Despite the stronger growth in the loan book, the bank was able to enhance its asset quality as the banks gross non-performing loan ratio edged down to 2.49 percent by the end of September from 2.74 percent at the start of the year.
Further, the provisions made for possible bad loans also declined to Rs.252.8 million from Rs.1.1 billion a year ago. 
Meanwhile, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the bank posted a net profit of Rs.10.2 billion or Rs.11.46 a share, an increase of 21.02 percent from the same period last year.
The NII rose by 8.5 percent YoY to Rs.24.5 billion and the net fee and commission income rose by 25 percent YoY to Rs.4.8 billion. 
ComBanks capitalization levels remained well above the minimum required levels as both Tier I and Tier II capital adequacy levels stood at 11.4 percent and 14.8 percent, respectively. The regulatory minimums are 5 percent and 10
percent, respectively. 
As at September 30, 2016, DFCC Bank held a 14. 74 percent stake in ComBank while Y.S.H.I. Silva held a 9.91 percent stake. The state-controlled private sector pension fund, the Employees Provident Fund, held 9.69 percent being the third largest shareholder.

Countrywide strike if minimum penalty not removed: LPBOA
	
The Lanka Private Bus Owners Association (LPBOA) Chairman Gemunu Wijeratne today warned that they would launch a countrywide strike by private bus operators if the government failed to remove the minimum penalty of Rs.2,500 for traffic offences as proposed in the 2017 Budget.
We met Finance Minister Ravi Karunayake on about four occasions to discuss our proposals, but he never told us about increasing the minimum penalty discussions regarding our proposals, but he didnt mention about increasing the minimum penalty on traffic offenses, he said.
Mr. Wijeratne said the Budget provides little or no support for the bus services in the country.
The government has reduced the prices of vehicles with an engine capacity of less than 1000cc to encourage vehicle importers and sellers. But there is no benefit to bus services, he said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

Donald Trump had acted in a Sri Lankan film
	
Americas President-elect Donald Trump had acted in a film co-produced by the veteran Sri Lankan film-maker Chandran Rutnam along with Bo Derek.

The 1989 film Ghosts Cant Do It was directed by John Derek. "John Derek wrote a scene especially for Donald Trump to play himself in a cameo role. We shot the scene in the board room of the Trump Tower. It was a one-day shoot and a delightful experience, Chandran said.
But the negative got scratched and we had to do it again. Trump happily agreed," Chandran recalled.
In Ghosts Cant Do It, Scott and Kate are happily married despite their 30-year age gap. After Scott suffers a heart attack and is unable to make love, he commits suicide and becomes a ghost whom only Kate can see and speak with. To make it possible for Scott to return embodied, they conjure up a plan to have a young man drown so that Scott can take his body.
Bo Derek appeared as Katie Scott, Antony Quinn as Scott, Julie Newmar as Angel, Leo Damien as Fausto, and Donald Trump as himself. Sri Lanka's versatile actor, Henry Jayasena, also appeared in the film. The film was shot in Galle in South Sri Lanka, Thoddu in the Maldives, and the states of Wyoming and New York in the US.
Despite the star-studded cast, Ghosts Cant Do It bombed at the box office and got negative reviews. It won the Stinkers Bad Movie Award and Bo Derek the Worst Actress prize. Donald Trump was declared the Worst Supporting Actor at the Golden Raspberry Awards.
Chandran has sent a congratulatory message to Trump on winning the US presidential election and invited him to Sri Lanka. (New Indian Express)

Fitch affirms StanChart Sri Lanka at AAA(lka)
	
Fitch Ratings has affirmed Standard Chartered Bank, Sri Lanka Branchs (SCBSL) national long- term rating at AAA(lka). The outlook is stable.
SCBSLs rating reflects the credit profile and financial strength of Standard Chartered Bank (SCB: A+/Stable). The rating is linked with SCBs Issuer Default Rating (IDR) because of SCBSLs legal status as a branch of SCB, which makes it part of the same legal entity.
SCBs rating is higher than Sri Lankas long-term local- and foreign-currency IDRs of B+/Negative and as a result, SCBSLs rating is at the highest end of the national rating scale for Sri Lanka.
Fitch believes support from SCB would be forthcoming if required, subject to regulatory constraints on remitting money into Sri Lanka. The local branch represented 0.12 percent of SCBs total assets at end-2015 and 1.4 percent of local banking sector assets at end-1H16.
Fitch expects the branch to maintain sufficient capitalisation to support its business plans despite regular profit repatriations. The branchs Fitch core capital ratio remained high, at 23.6 percent, at end-June 2016 (2015: 25.5 percent).
Fitch expects SCBSLs loan book to remain concentrated among top-tier corporate clients, despite its focus on building its retail book. Its business model has helped sustain better-than-industry asset-quality metrics, with a reported gross non-performing loan ratio of 0.35 percent at end-June 2016 (2015:0.40 percent).

Gymkhana set to rob government
	
Once the countrys most prestigious recreational and sports clubs, Gymkhana has fallen under the iron grip of a few shady officials who have been carrying out some corrupt activity for a long time at one of Colombo Sevens most iconic landmarks to bring the club to its knees, while their latest unscrupulous adventure seems set to rob the country of a few billion Rupees.
Prasantha Wimalasena, none other than the secretary of the club has spilled the beans of a massive deal that is on the verge of robbing the government of potentially Sri Lankas most expensive piece of real estate.
Part of prime 6.5-acre State land in Colombo 7 worth Rs. Billions to be leased out by the club without government approval for apartment complex
Wimalasena, who had had enough of the corrupt activity perpetrated by a few top officials, made a bold move to become the whistle-blower of what is going on, and has been involved in a few costly legal battles for the past few months in the hope of purging the club of corrupt elements and restoring it past glory as one of Sri Lankas most elite sports clubs.
Gymkhana Club is housed at probably the most prominent Colombo Seven property which is owned by the State. The club obtained this priceless piece of land through the Land Commissioners Department, on a 30-year long-term lease from January 1, 1991.
The land which has a total extent of 6.5 acres and 10 perches has been leased to the club for its sports activities which includes a Cricket wing - CCC, Rugby wing - CH and FC, Tennis wing - Queens Club and several other disciplines like Hockey and Squash.
The lease is to expire in 2021, and it is obvious that the club has no claim for ownership or at least the right to occupy the premises beyond that. Wimalasena confirmed that he had verified with the land commissioner that no extension has been granted to Gymkhana beyond 2021 to occupy the land that they first occupied in 1957.
But on or about October 8 this year, the club president Shammi Silva and Treasurer Kapila Ranasinghe had entered into a questionable agreement with a company called Fairway Developments Limited to lease them a part of this state land at least for a period of 25 years for the construction of an apartment complex.
It had been done arbitrarily without the approval of the club members or informing the government which owns the land.
The Development company has already paid Rs. 15 million to the club and is ready to start the project pending the UDA Planning and Building approval. This payment had been made through two cheques, one for Rs. Ten million from the companys subsidiary Fairway Galle (Private) Limited and another for Rs. 5 million from another subsidiary of the company called Fairway Elements (Pvt.) Limited.
Interestingly, this agreement had been executed by the club officials who are a law unto themselves whilst a stay order has been placed by the District Court of Colombo against a special General Meeting of the club that was scheduled to be conducted on March 19, 2016 in order to obtain the approval of the club membership for the project. The stay order is still in place and will remain till January 9, 2017.
In addition to the above action by club members, Wimalasena who is the incumbent secretary of the club has initiated action against Silva and his committee members for significant irregularities and corrupt practices carried out against the interests of the club.
On June 11, 2008 Sri Lanka Survey Department had resurveyed the state land occupied by the club and issued a fresh survey plan 8924 to the club.
However, club president Shammi Silva who is also the Treasurer of Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) and his committee had sub-divided the land through a private survey for the controversial apartment project.
Wimalasena pointed out that there is no legal provision in Sri Lanka for anyone to carry out an exercise to sub-divide a state land through a private survey.
The section two of the clubs constitution states that it should be a Private Members Club established for sports recreation and social amenities. It is quite obvious that the club is not allowed to operate as a business enterprise and the government did not allocate the prime state land to run businesses but for the clubs proclaimed objectives.
The club has been winning domestic championships on a consistent basis in rugby and cricket. It was in the peak of sports activities and also in its reputation as a prominent social club by the time this prime state land was allocated to it, so no one would have had second thoughts about it as the club was obviously one of the most prestigious, if not the most, sports establishment of the country ever since the colonial era.
But things started to change in 2005, when Shammi Silva first became president of the club and told his committee that the club needed urgent remedies to its flagging financial state.
Under the guise of carrying out a gymnasium project, the club built a massive commercial building on the state land. Presently the land houses businesses like a Pub, two night clubs, a Bank, A hairdressing salon, a pharmacy and a retails shop. Additionally, on the land the government had given to the club to promote sports, there is another Karaoke club and an up-market social escort service. Wimalasena said that despite all these commercial ventures, the club was still very much in the red mainly due to the shocking commercial agreements that had been signed with the occupants at unbelievably low rentals for the buildings. A square foot in Colombo 7 usually costs Rs. 150-200 but occupants at Gymkhana premises only pay Rs. 15-20 per square foot according to Wimalasena. He added that most of the occupants strangely were either Silvas close relatives or friends.
Wimalasena also revealed that the club has defrauded the state in several other ways. He said the club had defrauded around Rs. Six million in VAT (Value Added Tax), NBT (Nation Building Tax) and ESC (Economic Service Charge) which resulted in a recent raid by the Inland Revenue Department. It was preceded by a raid by the excise department which sealed the clubs bar. The club has defaulted land tax to the UDA to the tune of Rs. Eight million while defaulting EPF and ETF dues to the tune of Rs. Six million. (Channaka De Silva)

HSBC 3Q pre-tax profit slumps 86% on Brazil unit sale charges
	
REUTERS: HSBC reported a sharper-than-expected 86 percent fall in pre-tax profit for the third quarter as the British lender booked a US $ 1.7 billion loss on the sale of its Brazilian unit and it was also hit by adverse foreigncurrency movements.
The banks reported pre-tax profit was US $ 843 million in the September quarter, down from US $ 6.1 billion in the same period a year ago, HSBC said in a Hong Kong stock exchange filing on Monday.
That was much lower than estimates of US $ 2.45 billion, based on the average of analysts forecasts compiled by the bank.
HSBC is the last major Britain-based lender to report third-quarter earnings, after Lloyds, Barclays and RBS all showed signs of coping better than expected in the aftermath of Britains vote to leave the EU.
Adjusted pre-tax profit, excluding the one-time charges, rose 7 percent during the quarter to US $ 5.6 billion, helped by increased revenue from its global banking and markets business, which houses its investment bank, HSBC said.
The bank said the main differences between reported and adjusted profits are foreign currency translation costs and significant items, including the operating results for its Brazil business as well as the loss recognised on disposal. HSBC earlier this year sold its Brazil unit in a US $ 5.2 billion deal.
The lenders core capital ratio, a key measure of financial strength, rose to 13.9 percent at the end of the September quarter from 12.1 percent at end-June, bolstered by a change in the regulatory treatment of its investment in Chinas Bank of Communications, CEO Stuart Gulliver said in a statement.
This is another action forming part of our ongoing capital management of the group that reinforces our ability to support the dividend, to invest in the business and, over the medium term, to contemplate share buy-backs, as appropriate, he said.
It also provides us with a significant capacity to manage the continuing uncertain regulatory environment.
HSBCs Hong Kong-listed shares extended gains to trade up about 2.5 percent after the results by 0514 GMT on Monday, compared with the broader Hong Kong stock markets 0.6 percent gain.

## Title: I am satisfied with my performance: President

I am satisfied with my performance: President
	
President Maithripala Sirisena said he was satisfied with his performance as the President where he succeeded in getting the 19th Amendment to the Constitution passed in parliament and getting independent commissions established.
In an interview with the Hindu newspaper, President Sirisena said he had ensured human rights, democratic rights, fundamental rights and the freedom of the people and given the maximum possible media freedom as the President.
When the people made me the President, they did not ask for food, water or clothes. They wanted a society where they could live freely and happily. I have given that to the people, he said.
Excerpts from the interview:
In November 2014, you left the ruling party to join the common opposition. At that time, you spoke of grave personal risks associated with the defection that proved historic, leading to a regime change in Sri Lanka. When you look back now, how does it feel What do you consider your biggest success as President
Now 22 months have passed since I became the President. I am satisfied with my performance during this time.
There are reasons for that. Firstly, I succeeded in getting the 19th Amendment to the Constitution (clipping the powers of the executive presidency and enabling the setting up of independent commissions) passed in parliament. We actually proposed that the executive powers of the President be reduced immediately. The Supreme Court said major clauses cannot be deleted without a referendum. Furthermore, the Supreme Court told us what could be done with two-thirds majority in parliament. So we have changed clauses to the maximum extent possible with two-thirds majority in parliament.
Earlier the President could dissolve the parliament after completion of one year of parliament, but now under the provisions of the 19th Amendment, it has been extended to four and a half years.
Establishment of independent commissions is another reason. It was essential for the country to ensure [protection of] human rights, democratic rights, fundamental rights and the freedom of the people. I have ensured that people get these rights, I have succeeded in doing that as President. I have given the maximum possible media freedom. There are no killings, abductions or cases of intimidation of media persons. They dont have to leave the country any more. Those who had fled the country earlier have now returned. That is what people expected from me.
When the people made me the President, they did not ask for food, water or clothes. They wanted a society where they could live freely and happily. I have given that to the people.
But these things should be given to a developed society, where educated, intelligent people live. Only those who are intelligent enough will use these freedoms and rights responsibly. People without a righteous mind will not realise the value of these. They are not happy about these [rights]. They might use this freedom to mislead the society. When these rights are given to the Western societies, they enjoy those rights because of their intellectual capacities.
In our ancient times, we were far ahead of the Western people in our intellectual capacities. Our history is an extraordinary one, dating back thousands of years. I do hope that people use the rights we have given them now  like human rights, fundamental rights, democratic rights and freedom  intelligently.
I said I am satisfied with what I have done in a short period of time. Before I came to power there was a fear that those who had given commands during the war could be taken to international courts of justice, that they may even face execution, and that they may have to sit on the electric chair.
The international community is so satisfied with my performance that they have completely changed their impression of the country. Now there is no threat of international courts, now we dont have to talk about electric chairs, there is no problem [of foreign judges investigating alleged violation of human rights]; I have told the international community that I cannot accept any proposal that allows foreign judges to probe our domestic matters. This is another great victory I was able to achieve in this time.
The former President Mahinda Rajapaksa called snap polls even though he had two more years in power left. There are two reasons why he called for fresh elections. Even today, he doesnt give the reasons for his decision to go for early elections.
There were two problems he could not solve as President. One was the UNHRC (United Nations Human Rights Council) proposals against our country. The second was that the country was heavily indebted at that time. We had a national debt of 9,000 billion [Sri Lankan] rupees. That was a major economic crisis for our country.
I am now dealing with the UNHRC proposals while protecting the respect and dignity of my country.
In order to solve this major economic crisis, we have been formulating a new economic plan. I believe in a mixed economy. One is the increase of foreign and local investments. We have now opened our doors to welcome investors, we provide them with tax holidays and various other concessions. Second problem was that the export market was declining, and our production for the export market was also rapidly declining. So now my second step is to strengthen the export production market and increase our exports.
My country is an agricultural nation. We are implementing a plan to develop our economy based on our indigenous production. With this vision, I have started four new projects. One is a campaign to improve national indigenous food production. Second is sustainable development, taking into consideration climate change and global warming. Third is a campaign against illicit drugs, and also gradual reduction and elimination of tobacco and alcohol usage. Fourth is addressing the chronic kidney disease affecting many. Every year, about 5,000 new cases of kidney ailments are diagnosed. Our population is 20 million and 5,000 new patients every year is a huge figure.
The new programme for national reconciliation is being implemented. It is a major initiative for reconciliation among Sinhala, Tamil, Muslim, Malay, Burgher and other communities to ensure coexistence and harmony. It is essential to strengthen reconciliation in order to prevent occurrence of another war in the country.
With all these successful efforts I am quite satisfied with my performance.
Those who have been in power and have lost power are trying to sabotage all these activities. They have sufficient funds and they use those funds to create chaos among the people and mislead people. They are abusing and misusing the democratic freedoms that I have restored in this country. They are making use of those freedoms to sabotage our efforts. I am closely monitoring these activities.
I am confident that I can face all these challenges and make our country better. The experience I have from my 50 years in politics gives me enough strength to meet all these challenges successfully.
You spoke about the economy. As someone with a Leftist background  I have read that you still have a Karl Marx picture in your living room  now in coalition with the United National Party known for its right-wing economic policies, how do you think your government can promote economic growth while safeguarding living standards and social welfare of farmers and workers
We have a consensual government of the two major parties. There are similarities as well as differences in the vision and policies of these two parties. The problems we face today are not the ones we faced 50 years ago. The world is changing rapidly. I have already told you that what is suitable for us is a mixed economy. My vision is social democracy.
Your question is how compatible is liberal democracy with social democracy. The two major parties have agreed on a consensual formula, a common plan of action has been agreed upon to continue and implement that programme. There is a broad agreement between the parties on this. We need large-scale investments. We cannot come out of the economic crisis without such investments. At the same time, enhancing social welfare and subsidies is also essential. The poor man is the one badly affected by a market economy. We have to protect the welfare and economy of the ordinary man. For that purpose, there is an agreement between the two parties in the consensual government. When there are differences in opinion, the major parties sit together, discuss them and solve them. Through discussion we solve those problems easily. We have a strong government. Some people believe that it is about to be toppled. That is a pipe dream. With perfect understanding we can take the country forward, while we solve those differences you mentioned.
You have been a frequent visitor to the Tamil-majority Northern Province  releasing some of the private land held by the army and inaugurating newly built homes for the displaced. How do you respond to the Tamil political leaderships concern over the pace of reconciliation, with unresolved issues like militarisation, political prisoners and the call to repeal the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA)
Reconciliation is not something that can be done in a few days. We got independence from colonial rule in 1948. We had the first parliamentary election in 1947. When a state leader visited Jaffna in the early days, it was almost a miracle. Very rarely did a leader go to Jaffna or the north. In the last 22 months I have been to Jaffna as President 11 times. Prior to that no leader went to the north [as often].
I feel very happy to interact  not just with the Tamil politicians in the north, but also with the people and obtain their ideas directly.
A vast majority  about 90 per cent of the people  in the north voted for me. They have confidence in me that I will solve their problems. So it is not only my responsibility, but also my obligation to solve their problems.
We are building houses for them in large numbers. We received assistance from India and many other countries for the housing projects. At the same time, we are giving back the land acquired by the military during the conflict to the original owners gradually.
In drafting the new Constitution, we are looking at a Constitution that will strengthen the reconciliation between the communities.
These things will have to be done keeping the southern Sinhala-Buddhist masses also satisfied. If the southern people are opposed to certain things, we cannot have a successful reconciliation process. Hence our endeavour towards reconciliation must also be acceptable to the Sinhalese, Tamils, Muslims and other communities. That is not an easy task. But we have to do this challenging job. We should not allow any possibility of a conflict recurring in our country.
Earlier you spoke of foreign judges. Can reconciliation proceed without accountability How will you convince the Tamils  who have little confidence in domestic judicial mechanisms  that an internal probe will be fair
When we came to power, our judiciary was very weak. One of the reasons we appointed a Chief Justice from the minority community was to enhance confidence in the judicial system among the minorities.
The leaders who were in power before I assumed office used to telephone and dictate terms to the judges, on how they should give verdicts. Major criminal charges against some people were withdrawn.
Now we dont interfere with the judiciary, we do not try to influence [the] judiciary. We improve the quality of the judiciary and its independence and impartial nature. We can obtain advice from foreign judicial experts. As per our constitutional provisions, there is no possibility of foreign judges participating in our judicial process or conducting cases. Only a citizen of our country can attend court proceedings. I dont have any mandate to act against constitutional provisions.
We have to create a judicial mechanism that has the fullest confidence of the people in the north.
We can also seek advice from expat Sri Lankans, who are judicial experts, on this process.
We are trying to work out a procedure which is also acceptable to those people speaking about getting foreign judges. We cannot satisfy everybody 100 per cent when we try to solve a problem of this nature. We can do something that is acceptable to and satisfies the vast majority.
In the context of the ongoing constitutional reform, there is a call from the Tamils for federalism. Do you think the new Constitution can meet that aspiration Some political actors in the south want a unitary Constitution, while constitutional experts seem to suggest that a compromise might be not terming the Constitution either unitary or federal.
People of the south are scared of the word federal. People of the north are scared of the word unitary. What we should do is not fight over these two words. We should come up with a formula that is acceptable to all.
It takes maturity to understand devolution. We cannot satisfy the extremist elements either in the north or in the south. We have to do what is good for, and acceptable to, the majority of the people.
As the leader of the SLFP, how will you hold the party together given the political pressure from the pro-Rajapaksa faction, even as you work with the UNP in Sri Lankas first national unity government
This is the first time in history that the two parties have come together in a consensual government. We were always used to governing separately, within the political party lines. We should not act in a backward, tribalistic manner. Separation and division are backward ideas. Those are qualities of a backward society.
The confidence in the SLFP as a party among the people is something lasting ages. People have recognised and accepted these two major parties  SLFP and the UNP. Therefore, in these circumstances, there is no possibility of new political forces coming up.
As a political party we have the ability to solve any problem.
What about pressure within the SLFP
There is no such pressure or influence within the party that I cannot withstand. The sole intention of the opponents is to disrupt and sabotage our programmes. When this governments programmes succeed, it becomes a defeat for the opponents. We can solve those internal issues.
Given the enhanced ties between India and Sri Lanka, do you think there is reason to expedite signing of the ETCA (Economic and Technological Cooperation Agreement), which has drawn considerable local resistance
Since ancient times we have very close relations with India. There are many similarities between the two countries. We have similar cultures. This relationship has been built on Hindu and Buddhist philosophies. We expect to sign trade agreements with quite a number of countries. These agreements are aimed at benefitting both the signatory countries and we dont intend signing any agreement that could be detrimental to any one country.
The proposal for India and Sri Lanka to sign a fresh [trade] agreement has been there for the last 10-15 years. Deliberations and discussions continued under different names. We will enter into an agreement which is not harmful to either party. The agreement will be signed after the approval of the Cabinet and will also be submitted to parliament. We cannot do anything in secrecy, we are transparent and accountable to the people.
Do you see a need for expediting it, or do you think it could take some more time for further negotiations
Well discuss it in the Cabinet, and after that it will also be produced in parliament. If there are any unsuitable clauses, we will have further discussions and finalise the agreement.
Work on Chinas port city project has resumed under your government amid local opposition. How is your governments policy towards China different from former President Rajapaksas
The port city agreement, when it was signed during President Rajapaksas time, was contradictory to the constitutional provisions. No government in the past had signed such an agreement. We amended certain clauses of that agreement as the new government. In such an agreement, the importance of national security as well as regional security should be taken into consideration.
Both China and India are our good friends. Our relations with both these countries go back to ancient times. Hence such agreements have to be dealt with perfect understanding. Such agreements should not interfere with the sovereignty of our nation.
The new government was able to discuss this with the Chinese government and remove unsuitable clauses in the agreement and make it good for both parties. The previous government entered such agreements in secrecy, but we are working in a transparent manner.
In a recent interview, you have said that investigation into some high-profile cases allegedly involving the former first family has not proceeded swiftly. Why do you think that is the case
In carrying out these investigations, what we expect is to fulfil the promise given to our people during the last election campaign. People gave me a mandate to govern this country by defeating an absolutely corrupt regime. There is something that people expected when they voted me into power. They expected corruption-free, good governance.
Good governance does not mean let go of the big, powerful people and punish the ordinary people. That is why I had to tell the investigation agencies, Do not act with political agenda.
Members of these commissions are excellent people, they act independently and impartially. The lower ranks supporting these commissions should also act similarly. I had to come out with that statement because there were such issues. Some of the media published my speech out of context. I believe that through that action I could get them back on the right track. I do not have a personal agenda, my agenda is for the country.
You had spoken specifically of money deposited in a bank in Dubai, the Avant Garde investigations and Wasim Thajudeen murder case involving President Rajapaksas family.
It pains my heart to see such investigations being suppressed or delayed. I do have doubts as to the reasons for this suppression. Hence I speak frankly and openly. But some people misinterpret my speeches.
Anything else you want to say
Our government has turned a new page in our international relations. Prior to my assuming office, Sri Lanka was an unaccepted country in the international community. I believe that all the countries in the world are our friends now. The manner in which I obtained the support of the international community  I feel it is a victory for me. Not just a victory for our country and people, but also a personal victory for me. In todays circumstances, no country can develop by making enemies in the international community.
At the time we came to power, even the ties with India  whose relationship we were proud of for years  was dented. Now all these have improved.

India will retrieve 115 seized boats from SL: Minister
	
Union Minister of State Shipping Pon Radhakrishnan on Thursday said the Centre would secure the release of 115 boats of Tamil Nadu fishermen.
Addressing media in Tamil Nadu, after inspecting the newly laid Danushkodi road, he said the ministerial-level meeting between India and Sri Lanka, scheduled for January 2, 2017, would discuss the contentious issue and secure the release of the boats.
On the outcome of the recent fishermen and ministerial-level talks in New Delhi, Mr. Radhakrishnan, who was part of the Indian delegation, said it was a good beginning and the first step towards finding a sustainable solution.
Mr. Radhakrishnan was confident that the Joint Working Group (JWG) on fisheries would protect the interest of Tamil Nadu fishermen when they venture into the sea. For the first time in all these years, it had been decided that officials from the two countries would meet once in three months and Ministers once in six months to address the issues, he said.
Mr. Radhakrishnan said pilgrims who visit the island had been facing problem in reaching the holy place ever since Danushkodi was destroyed in the 1964 cyclonic storm.
When the newly laid road was about to be inaugurated, high tidal waves hit the edges of the road on some stretch and caused breaches.
The National Highways Authority of India has been asked to repair the damaged part after which the road would be thrown open for traffic, he said.
On the proposed bridge between Danushkodi and Talaimannar, he said, We are ready and once the Sri Lankan government agrees to the project, the dream of Bharati will come true, he said referring to the revolutionary poets song we will build a bridge to Sinhalese island. The Minister called on APJM Maraikayar, brother of late President APJ Abdul Kalam. (The Hindu)
