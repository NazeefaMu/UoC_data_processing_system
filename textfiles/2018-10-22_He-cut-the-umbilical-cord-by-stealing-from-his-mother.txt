A millionaire businessman from Polonnaruwa had told his mother that he wanted to pay her back for having brought him into this world and clothed and fed him as a child. He wanted to know from his mother, who lived a comfortable life in Maturata with her husband from the money she got as a pension due to the disappearance of one her sons during the war, if she would like to come and live with him for some time. She was happy to accept as she loved her son.

He picked his mother up in a swanky car and took her to his home where she spent two months.During this time the woman's son, who she loved and trusted took advantage of his mother and cheated her of Rs. 150,000 that he took on two occasions from her bank account. In spite of the fact that he was an owner of a textile business and a wealthy man, he sent his mother back empty handed in a bus with just the clothes she had on her back. When she got back, she complained to the Grama Niladhari of her area about what her son had done to her, saying she he had taken the money collected by her over a period of time to be used for meritorious deeds. So much for gratitude.(By A.J. Karandagolla)
