The Navy had earned an income of Rs. 220 million (USD 1.55 million) from the operations of Avant Garde Maritime Services Ltd (AGMSL) during the period from November 13 to December 13, Navy Spokesman Akram Alavi said in a statement today.
The Government in early November decided to handover the operations of the controversial AGMSL to the Navy.
Providing security to merchant ships carrying weapons, ammunitions and related equipment and for the smooth functioning of onboard security to vessels plying to and from High Risk Areas (HRA) were some of the operations carried out by the Navy since the takeover.
The Navy bears the responsibilities of receiving, holding and issuing of weapons, ammunitions and equipment belonging to foreign and local On Board Security Teams (OBST) who operate for merchant shipping companies which was exclusively handled by M/S Avant Garde Maritime Services Ltd (AGMSL) previously.
“The Navy had carried out a total of 652 moves in Galle and Colombo Harbour during the period from November to December and earned an income of Rs. 220 million. The revenue earned from these operations is directly deposited in the Consolidated Fund of the Government,” the statement said.
