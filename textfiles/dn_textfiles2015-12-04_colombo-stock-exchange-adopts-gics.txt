Colombo Stock Exchange adopts GICS

The adoption of Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) by Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) is very important step for sector investing and portfolio diversification, said Vajira Kulatilaka, Chairman of CSE.
CSE announced that CSE is adopting the GICS to classify its listed companies along with S&P/CSE co branded sector indices. The pilot period commenced on December 02, 2015. "This globally accepted standard not only will enable foreign investors to analyze the sector diversity of the Sri Lankan equity market but also local investors to truly diversify," he said.
GICS was jointly developed by Standard & Poor's and MSCI Barra to meet the global financial community's need for one complete, consistent set of global sector and industry definitions. The world's leading financial professionals across all investment disciplines, have adopted GICS as the classification standard. The CSE intends to consider GICS as an alternative classification of companies for a pilot period of one year during which period the current classification would also be maintained alongside the proposed GICS. This will provide adequate time for the stakeholders to be comfortable with GICS facilitating a smooth transition.
Rajeeva Bandaranaike, CEO of CSE said, "We are sure that the decision to adopt GICS would enhance the market infrastructure and help the investors to better understand the characteristics and change of industry structure. The gradual implementation of the project will help smooth transition from the existing classification to GICS."
Alka Banerjee, Managing Director, Head of Equity Indices Product Management, S&P Dow Jones Indices said, "We look forward to being a part of the Sri Lankan equity market growth journey."
