The Office on Missing Persons (OMP) today expressed optimism about establishing several regional offices within the next six months.

The OMP earlier announced its plan to establish 12 regional offices, eight in the North and East, and four in the rest of the country, in order to expand its services and to receive information and complaints about the missing.

OMP Chairman Saliya Pieris PC today said if all the processes were completed smoothly, they would be able to establish not one but more regional offices in the coming months.

“Most likely, the first set of regional offices would be set up in the North,” he told Daily Mirror.

The regional offices would be established in Jaffna, Kilinochchi, Mannar, Batticaloa, Trincomalee, Ampara, Mullaitivu, Vavuniya, Matara, Kurunegala, Moneragala and Kandy.

Meanwhile, Mr. Pieris said the next outreach meeting of the OMP would be held in Mullaitivu on Saturday (2). Previous outreach meetings were held in Mannar and Matara.(Lahiru Pothmulla)
