	The Attorney General is studying the cases of 20 more LTTE suspects detained under the Prevention of Terrorism Act to see whether they can be released, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Prison Reforms Minister said yesterday.
	Minister D.M. Swaminathan said he would meet Law and Order Minister Sagala Ratnayake and the relevant officials to discuss this matter further.
	He said PTA detainees, charged with serious terrorist acts, would be prosecuted while those held up without charges would be considered for release or rehabilitation.
	“There is a delay on the part of the Attorney General’s Department in clearing these cases,” he said.
	On an earlier occasion, Foreign Affairs Minister Mangala Samaraweera said a general amnesty would be considered for all such suspects. (Kelum Bandara)
