Nations Trust Bank partnered with Unigiros, a remittance services provider in Israel, to facilitate easy remittances to Sri Lanka for the growing Sri Lankan community in Israel.


To promote the service and create awareness, Nations Trust Bank and its remittance partner in Israel collaborated to organise a campaign where every customer who used the service to remit money to Sri Lanka was entered into a lucky draw to win special prizes. Five winners were chosen and they nominated a representative in Sri Lanka to collect their prizes at a special ceremony held at Nations Trust Bank’s Head Office in Colombo.
