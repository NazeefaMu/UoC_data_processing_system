He was jeered instead of cheered


	

A former powerful political leader attended a ceremony at a place of religious worship during a visit to the periphery the other day.

 


A certain deputy purohita in yahapalanaya quietly met the former political heavyweight at this ceremony. The former political boss who was elated over the deputy’s friendly gesture in attending the ceremony, immediately announced: “Here’s yet another yahapalanaya big gun set to join us!”


The former political leader who expected the large crowd present to break into cheers and applause was visibly taken back when they greeted this announcement with boos and catcalls. “Let him come. We will take proper care of him,” some of them shouted. 


The deputy who cut a sorry figure later left the place as quietly as he came, they say.
