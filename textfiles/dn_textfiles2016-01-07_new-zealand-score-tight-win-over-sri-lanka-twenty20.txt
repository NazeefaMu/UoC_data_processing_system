New Zealand score tight win over Sri Lanka in Twenty20

New Zealand held their nerve to beat Sri Lanka by three runs in their Twenty20 international against New Zealand in Mount Maunganui on Thursday.
 
Chasing the Black Caps' 182-4 in front of a full house of 7845 spectators at the Bay Oval, the visitors finished at 179-9 in the first game of a two-match series.
 
Left-hander Milinda Siriwardana looked poised to steer Sri Lanka home but fell to a sliding catch on the mid-wicket boundary by Mitchell McClenaghan off Trent Boult after reaching 42 off 31 balls at number six.
 
The tourists needed 19 off the last two overs before paceman Mitchell McClenaghan went for just six off the penultimate over. Grant Elliott was then entrusted with the final over and did the job.
 
Boult took 3-21 at his home ground for the victors to take Man of the Match honours.
 
Earlier, Martin Guptill's dominance of the Sri Lankan bowlers continued apace as the New Zealand opener thumped 58 off 34 balls.
 
Guptill, who made 331 runs at an average of 82.75 in the just-completed one-day series, struck four sixes and four fours before being run out in the 11th over as the hosts piled the pressure on Sri Lanka from the outset.
 
He and stand-in skipper Kane Williamson put on 101 for the first wicket in 10.5 overs as Williamson made 53 off 42 deliveries, striking five fours and a six.
 
Sri Lanka's spinners had marginally more success in slowing New Zealand's run-rate but the visitors missed a chance to get rid of Guptill when he should have been run out when on 32 after being stranded by his batting partner. Williamson also had a close shave when he french-cut a delivery off Suranga Lakmal when on 30.
 
Williamson and Colin Munro scored singles off 22 consecutive balls before the usually explosive Munro broke the sequence with a six and a reverse-hit for four prior to Williamson's dismissal.
 
Corey Anderson's return to action after a long spell sidelined by injury lasted only three balls but Munro made 36 off 25 balls (two sixes and two fours) while Ross Taylor added 22 off nine balls.
 
Nuwan Kulasekera was the pick of the Sri Lankan bowlers with 2-26 off his four overs.
 
New Zealand were sent into bat by Sri Lankan T20 skipper Dinesh Chandimal, as his team-mate Angelo Mathews did in the one-dayer won by New Zealand at the same Bay Oval venue on Tuesday.
 
In Sri Lanka's chase, Boult picked up two early wickets with leg-side strangles as wicketkeeper Luke Ronchi caught dangerous veteran opener Tillakaratne Dilshan and rookie Shehan Jayasuriya.
 
And while opener Danushka Gunathilaka was making hay at one end, he couldn't find a steady partner - when Mathews swatted Matt Henry to short cover, the tourists were 42-4 after five overs.
 
Gunathilaka perished when he tried to turn leg-spinner Ish Sodhi into the on side and got a leading edge to backward point after making a threatening 46 off only 29 balls, with three fours and two sixes.
 
SCOREBOARD: New Zealand 182-4 (Martin Guptill 58, Kane Williamson 53, Colin Munro 36; Nuwan Kulasekera 2-26) beat Sri Lanka 179-9 (Danushka Gunathilaka 46, Milinda Siriwardana 42; Trent Boult 3-21) by three runs.
