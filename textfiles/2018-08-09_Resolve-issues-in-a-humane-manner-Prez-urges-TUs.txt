President Maithripala Sirisena today requested the trade unions including the railways to resolve their issues in an intelligent and humane manner without causing inconvenience to the innocent people.

Addressing an event held at the Viharamahadevi Park, President Sirisena expressed his regrets over the disruptions faced by students, who were attending the GCE Advanced Level (AL) Examination due to the strike action being carried out by the railway trade unions.

“The inconvenience will be caused to the people and not for the Government through these trade union actions. Peoples’ right should be preserved and the trade unions should look into this matter in a more humane way irrespective of their privileges,” he said.

He also said any party had the ability to discuss their issues with the Government at present unlike during the former Government.
