They came uninvited and stole the show


	



 

A former Deputy from Wayamba recently hosted a political heavyweight in the country to a luncheon at his residence.

 


The host and his wife were shocked when a sitting Diyawanna member from the same area and his charming wife who were not invited boldly stepped into their residence, walked up to the guest of honour and started a conversation with him.


What was worse was that the former deputy and the Diyawanna member were arch enemies. Some time ago the Diyawanna member’s supporters had set upon the former deputy’s son while the member looked. The strained relationship between the two had turned into enmity since that incident. 
While the hosts were fuming inwardly, the uninvited guest and his wife were seen enjoying a chat with the political heavyweight who was unaware of the undercurrents.
