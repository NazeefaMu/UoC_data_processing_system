The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) today urged President Mithripala Sirisena to convene Parliament immediately using his executive powers and debate the Bond Commission and PRECIFAC reports without issuing challenges at election rallies.

JVP MP Vijitha Herath told a news conference that the President had claimed that a coalition of VIP 'robbers' both in the government and the opposition had managed to delay the debate on the bond commission and the PRECIFAC reports and had challenged them to hold the debate on those two reports before February 10.

He said the President had convened Parliament using his executive powers during the Meethotamulla catastrophe even when the Prime Minister was not in the country at the time and added that the President could do so at this juncture as well. (Ajith Siriwardana)
