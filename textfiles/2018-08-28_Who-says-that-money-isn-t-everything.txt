A certain white-collar high-up in charge of a Province was recently promoted to the top post in the Ministry, thanks to his closeness to a political authority.




His subordinates at district offices eager to cultivate the goodwill of the boss now elevated to higher status lost no time in organizing sendoffs to him.


Some white-collar ones at a district office had decided to say farewell to the boss at a function organized on a grand scale and collected a sizable amount to buy an expensive gift to be presented to the boss.


The party organizers had been putting their thick heads together to decide on an appropriate gift when they received a decisive message from the guest himself: “I would prefer money rather than a gift!”
