Island-wide blackout lasting hours


	

The entire country plunged into total darkness following a major power failure this afternoon and the Engineers of the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) were struggling to detect the cause for the breakdown.

Power and Renewable Energy Ministry Secretary Dr. Suren Batagoda said a disruption on the main line from Polpitiya in Lakshapana to the Kolonnawa main grid seemed to be the cause of island wide blackout experienced this afternoon.

When asked whether the disruption of power was an act of sabotage Dr. Batagoda said he could not rule out such allegation as disruption of a single grid could not result in a countrywide blackout as each section has a respective protection system in place.

Meanwhile, General Manager CEB M C Wickramasekara said the current findings on the technical side of the disruption of power could not be interpreted as sabotage or not.

He said an initial technical report had revealed that the link between Polpitiya and Kolonnawa had been disrupted and that they are waiting for a full technical report to determine what exactly caused to the blackout.

Questions were being asked whether the power failure which lasted more than two hours was an act of sabotage or a technical fault.

Deputy General Manager – System Control of the CEB, H.D.S.Thimothius soon after the break down told the Daily Mirror that he was struggling to find the cause to the power failure and added the System Control branch was in the process of restoring the power gradually.

“It could be due to a strike of lightening on one of our major generators or any other reason. The entire system has suffered a break down. We are right now in the process of restoring power section by section. It will take another two hours to restore power to the entire country,” Mr. Thimothius said around 4.00 pm today.

Meanwhile, Power and Renewable Energy Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya has instructed Ministry Secretary Batagoda to appoint a committee to investigate the island wide power failure and report. (Sandun A Jayasekera, Kurulu Koojana Kariyakarawana and Darshana Sanjeewa)
