Sasini Sandeepani the female student seen in photographs being beaten by a policeman during the HNDA protest at Ward Place said she was discharged by the Colombo National Hospital doctors despite her complains of constant head pains.
At an Inter-University Students’ Federation organized media briefing today, 21-year-old Sasini said she was still having head pains though she was advised to go home on October 30.
“Because my head pains are still continuing, my parents consulted a private a doctor to do a check-up. After the check-up he advised that I be hospitalized and undergo a CT scan immediately,” she said.
She described how she was repeatedly beaten by the police during the clash between the police and the students.
“We were washing our faces at the pond after the fired tear gas when policemen and anti-riot squad personnel suddenly descended on us and started beating us. I fell when I was beaten several times on my spine. Even then they did not stop beating me,” Sasini said. Meanwhile, Sasini’s father Kingsley Kumarasiri said they had received telephone calls claiming they were from the Cinnamon Gardens Police asking Sasini to report to the police to give a statement.
He said they did not take their daughter to the particular police station fearing for her Sasini since they were doubtful about the telephone calls received.
IUSF Convener Lahiru Weerasekara challenged any senior police officer for a debate and asked the police not to act like comedians by attempting to cover up the truth. (Piyumi Fonseka)
