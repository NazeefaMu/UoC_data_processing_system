Red signals from two world powers!


	



 

A rumour doing rounds in political circles says that two missives delivered to our Foreign Ministry by two foreign diplomatic missions here have sent the government high-ups into a fluster.   

 


The two diplomatic missions represent two powerful countries and the tone of both missives is said to be ominous. Hence the high concern of the top authorities.


Each of these two missives has reportedly raised the grave concern of the guest country regarding certain public statements made by some government bigwigs which they describe as being damaging to its image. One of these two countries, according its missive, is highly perturbed over an allegation being repeatedly made about a monetary donation offered to a prominent candidate at an election here in the recent past.


The missive of the mission representing the other guest country is said to be a hard-hitting reply to an allegation recently made by a senior top team member that the country concerned is bankrolling the JO in a bid to oust yahapalanaya. 


Observers say that Yahapalanaya cannot afford to pooh-pooh these two missives as both are world powers. In fact, we are under much obligation to one of these two countries which is Asian one for pouring precious forex into the exchequer through a series of mega development projects.


By the way, reports say that the envoy from the Asian power who called on a very high political authority here sounded a note of warning about repeat allegations prejudicial to their interests.
