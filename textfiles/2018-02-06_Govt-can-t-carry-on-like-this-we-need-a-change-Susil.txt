Minister Susil Premajayantha said today President Maithripala Sirisena would be compelled to effect changes at the national level soon after the Local Government elections because the current government could not continue in this manner.

"Although the UNP stated that when the election is over the current unity government will continue as usual but anyone can understand that it was impossible to do so," he told the weekly SLFP news briefing.

"The people want a change. Most of the sectors in the country are facing a crisis, such as the prices of essential items increasing, unemployment, economic problems, and the increase in the number of robberies. Considering these facts it is necessary to have a change as soon as possible. I can't tell you now how the changes will be carried out, but the President himself has said he will take the control of the country's economy after the elections and promised to punish the corrupt. He will decide how the changes will be made, but change is a must."  (Sandun A Jayasekera)
