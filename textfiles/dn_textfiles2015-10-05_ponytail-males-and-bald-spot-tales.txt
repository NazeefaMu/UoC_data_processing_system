Ponytail males and bald spot tales!

The sixties, oh for the swinging sixties, the era we baby boomers still long for. Mention of the sixties rouses strong exciting emotions among many of us who were teens and now in our mid and late three score and something years. Many can look back at this decade of youth, excitement and inventiveness as a real turning point in societies around the world.
Still it is regarded as one of those decades which have now taken on an almost mythical aura. In a decade dominated by youth, the vogue burst into bloom in our own conservative island nation.
The country too was to soon witness a seismic shift in music, movies, clothes and hairstyles. Sri Lanka was swinging and the Galle Face Hotel’s ‘Coconut Grove’ and the Ceylinco Hotel’s ‘Akasa Kadey’ were ‘the scene,’ meaning the chic places to go. Colombo was buzzing with show bands and pulsing with half a dozen separate veins of excitement.
Yes siree, and zapped with the taste of rebellion I was in the thick of it all. Even as a school-going teenager I swung into the action as a stage-stomping presenter in the exhilarating entertainment circuit. Boy, oh boy, I was in my element making whoopee as well as pretty good ‘moolah’ in the process.
And yes, everyone seemed to be letting their hair down, both literally and figuratively. They did so without a care for the existing conservative greased down city slicker styles. Slightly longer hair trends of the day were influenced by Elvis into the 60?s. Most maverick lads traded their crew-cuts and parted with their side partings for longer brushed-back hair styles.
So I simply let my mane grow and sort of fantail reasonably longer at the back. Certainly not in the messy hippie fashion but nonetheless quite hip or modernist ‘mod’ at the time. Besides to give you a better idea of the image, it resembled the Johnny Weismuller Tarzan look. Although my kid sister Ann said uncharitably that my new-look appearance reminded her of Cheetah, Tarzan’s pet chimp.
But then it was only a matter of time before some of my peers graduated to wearing pony-tails and rat-tails which were referred to derogatorily as male-tails. Which reminds me of a recent strange coincidence that brought about a good deal of sixties nostalgia. I am talking about just the other day when I was working on the computer quite at peace. Apparently a black and white photograph had slipped out of a book our maid was dusting.
She had handed it over to my wife while going into gales of giggles. The better half duly brought it to me with the maid following and still in the throes of her irrepressible magpie titters. The maid’s name is Maggie. I have dubbed her the magpie and have added the Sinhala vernacular to the moniker, ‘Polkichchi.’ The wife flipped the photograph on my desk with the legerdemain of a casino dealer. It landed face-side up on the desk as she queried: “Guess who?”
I adjusted my glasses and took a cursory glance. The face looked distantly familiar. Then it hit me with sudden clarity. It was me! I mean the youthful me of the rebellious period with overgrown hair. The mug was sans the jowls and the double chin of the fat-faced brigand who of late stares back at me from the mirror while I shave. I usually glower back at the hostile image which in turn gives me the most irritatingly patronising curled lip smirk.
I tossed the picture back at my wife and wisecracked: “Who is he? Pretty good looking chappie! It’s probably one of your old Hollywood pinup boys?” I knew the cheeky quip was a cinch for a pinch. And I was right. Ouch! But I bore it stoically with an infuriating grin or was it a grimace as she sashayed out mumbling something about ‘the vanity of old duffers’. The maid followed still giggling.
When I was around 19 an acquaintance dubbed ‘Kaputa,’ for obvious reasons, used to sport a pony-tail. There was nothing unique about it at the time because he possessed a reasonable head of hair. But the old adage still stands good, with a little amendment of course: “Boys will be boys and so will a lot of middle-aged men.” The maxim appeared spot on for Kaputa, bald spot and all, because the male-tail remained even when he was 45-years-old and displaying a fast receding hairline.
That was bad enough contending with the decline and fall of the hairline empire puns and witticisms that followed his pony-tail. But now pushing 70 he appeared at a recent cocktail party completely bald in front but still sporting a thin, itty-bitty little rat-tail held back with a rubber band at the back of his shiny noggin.
His appearance naturally provided a great deal of grist for many an imbibing wit. To make matters worse he had grown a bushy beard to hide a multitude of chins. This prompted our incorrigible wit Surchepps to proclaim: “His beard makes him look like he has his head on upside down.” And then the whole caboodle of snipers began firing their derisory fusillades at him. Friend Collie who is being ‘follically challenged’ as well, but with no signs of a male-tail quipped: “There are three ways a man wears his hair. Parted, un-parted or like Kaputa ... departed.”
And somewhere from the back of the dimly-lit bar emerged the voice of another anonymous guerrilla marksman who had Kaputa in his cross-hairs: “For heaven’s sake make sure he doesn’t fall and suffer a hairline fracture.”
I did a lot of horsing around during my youth but was too conservative to pony my tail.
There was a time when I fashioned my hair according to the existing style. But now I have to fashion it according to my existing hair.
