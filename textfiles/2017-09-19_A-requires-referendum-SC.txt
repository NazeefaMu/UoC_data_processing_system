The Supreme Court had ruled that some clauses of the 20th Amendment were inconsistent with the Constitution and therefore, it requires a referendum after gaining two-thirds majority in Parliament, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya told Parliament today.

The 20th Amendment also includes provision to hold elections for all Provincial Councils on the same day.
