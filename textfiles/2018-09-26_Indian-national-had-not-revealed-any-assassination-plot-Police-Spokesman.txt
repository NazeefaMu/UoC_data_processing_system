Police Spokesman SP Ruwan Gunasekara today said the Indian national had not revealed any assassination plot to the CID on President Maithripala Sirisena and former President Mahinda Rajapaksa but had only spoken of a threat to several individuals following the revelation by Anti Corruption Movement’s Director Operations Namal Kumara on assassination plot.

He told a news conference that the CID in its B-report filed in the Colombo Magistrate’s Court on Tuesday had not mentioned anything about an assassination plot revealed by the Indian national.

SP Gunasekara said that the Indian National Mercil Thomas had been arrested by the CID on September 21 on information received by Anti Corruption Movement’s Director Operations Namal Kumara.

“The only thing the suspect had revealed was that he felt about a threat to several individuals after disclosing the video and audio clip of a telephone conversation by Namal Kumara at a press conference and the media reports on the incident. The suspect had said to the CID officers that he visited Namal’s residence to inquire about it,” SP Gunasekara added.

He said the Indian national had arrived in Sri Lanka in January 2017 and added that he had stayed in several places.

“However, it was yet to reveal how and from whom he received funds. CID is conducting further investigations on a detention order,’ he said. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
