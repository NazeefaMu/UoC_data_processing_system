Megapolis and Western Development Ministry, together with the Urban Development Authority (UDA) and the CHEC Port City Colombo (Pvt.) Ltd signed the tripartite agreement for the development of the CIFC replacing the previous agreement signed by the former government.

The CIFC would be governed under a new Act titled Colombo International Financial Centre Law which would be introduced in Parliament shortly.
