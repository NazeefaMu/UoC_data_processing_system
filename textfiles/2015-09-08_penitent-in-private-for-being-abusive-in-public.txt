Penitent in private for being abusive in public!


	


The new Big Boss recently chaired a meeting of the Betel leaf alliance leaders. Among the participants at this meeting was the loquacious ‘patriot’ of the farce–unto-death fame. 
When the meeting was in progress, the ‘patriot’ asked the new Big Boss whether he was planning to dissolve the Betel leaf alliance and the latter replied there was no such move. Again the ‘patriot’ craned his neck towards the new Big Boss and spoke to him softly: “Sir, Some people may have told you that I abused you at election meetings. Please don’t believe their stories…”  The new Big Boss only smiled.
However, when the media went to town with the story that the ‘patriot’ had apologized to the new Big Boss, the latter quickly dismissed the story as false and baseless.
