GTF-GSLF debate on sidelines of UNHRC session


	

One of the side events organised by the Global Tamil Forum (GTF) to coincide with the UNHRC's 37th session in Geneva was called off midway following a heated argument between GTF and Global Sri Lankans Forum (GSLF) representatives on Monday, sources said.

Two side events organised by the GTF and the GSLF were held on Monday with the objective of making the international community aware of the progress made by the Sri Lankan government with regard to reconciliation.

The GTF event was also attended by GSLF representatives. At this event, GTF members including representative Paul Newman accused the government of overpopulating Trincomalee with Sinhala people and accused the Sinhalese of massacring Muslims.

Responding to these charges, GSLF representative Nalaka Godahewa said it was the LTTE which in 1990 had ordered the Muslims to vacate the Jaffna Peninsula within 48 hours and the LTTE had massacred hundreds of Muslims.

"The LTTE also killed 147 Muslims who were praying inside a mosque in Kattankudi in 1990. Sinhalese don't complain about the increasing Tamil population in Wellawatta during the past 100 years. Any person belonging to any community can live anywhere in Sri Lanka," he said.

When GTF representatives had attempted to obstruct the GSLF speakers, the GSLF members had retaliated.

GSLF Co-President of Israel Janith Wimala said the international community which shed crocodile tears over the killing of Tamils, was silent the Sinhalese were killed.

Sources said several GSLF members including Wasantha Keerthirathna, Kumari Muahndiram and Nimala Liyanapatabendi took part in the debate held afterwards and the GTF had ended it midway without responding to GSLF allegations.(Lahiru Pothmulla)
