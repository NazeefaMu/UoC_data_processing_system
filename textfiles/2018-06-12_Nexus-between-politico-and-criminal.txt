A convict in a rape and murder case known to be a sidekick of a former powerful politico had got himself transferred from the cell to the state lodge sickbay by complaining of a serious heart condition. 

 


Doctors have found that the man is not suffering from a serious heart ailment as complained and however, he has been allowed to remain in the sickbay.


When the politico was in power, he had given orders to keep his sidekick in the state lodge close to the latter’s home town, but the man has now been transferred to a lodge in another area.


However, the politico continues to use his influence to have the convict transferred back to the state lodge close to his home town.
