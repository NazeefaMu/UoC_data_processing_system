Cargills Bank was recognized as an ICONIC Superhero for excellence in Omni Experience, at the recent International Data Corporation (IDC) Insights Awards.  


As a premier global market intelligence provider on technology, IDC’s selection of Cargills Bank underscores the bank’s world-class use of fintech to provide financial services.


The ICONIC award was based on Cargills Bank creating transformational business value, enabling customers and staff to seamlessly engage for new products, services and experiences. This transformation was done through the deployment of Cargills Cash - Agent Banking at Cargills Food City Supermarkets, a visually stunning website featuring a chatbot and extensive use of a productivity suite for workflow, e-learning, loan origination and customer onboarding.
“Banking on the Human Spirit is what motivates us and this prestigious award from IDC recognizes the passion of Cargills Bank. We have taken banking to the masses through Cargills Supermarkets by making Cargills Cash part of a customer’s lifestyle. Our website engages millennials as well as their parents by using social media technology and our use of productivity tools has created low friction business processes. It is gratifying to be recognised globally and the IDC ICONIC award will spur us to keep banking on the Human Spirit,” said Cargills Bank Limited Chief Operating Officer Rohan Muttiah.


Cargills is a brand that has been faithfully serving Sri Lankans for 173 years, built on a foundation of values and ethics. True to this heritage and the ethos of ‘Banking on the Human Spirit’, Cargills Bank is taking banking to the masses by being inclusive and accessible. 


The amazing Cargills Cash savings account is available at over 320 Cargills Food City outlets - allowing you to do grocery shopping and banking at the same place at your convenience. The Cargills Bank debit card with special offers is now a ‘must have’ for discerning customers.
