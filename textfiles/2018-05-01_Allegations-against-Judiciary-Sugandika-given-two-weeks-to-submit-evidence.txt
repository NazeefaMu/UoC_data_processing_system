Allegations against Judiciary:  Sugandika given two weeks to submit evidence


	

The Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) today said that it had given two weeks to Attorney-at-Law Sugandhika Fernando to produce the evidence to prove her allegations against the Judiciary.

BASL Chairman U. R. de Silva PC said BASL’s attention was directed to a statement made by Ms. Fernando last month, where she referred to the injustice caused by some officials of the Judiciary and the Police.

He said, though she had made such a remark, she had not complained to the BASL about such incidents.

Mr. de Silva said the BASL had written to Ms Fernando on April 26, informing her it would take necessary legal action against the wrongdoers irrespective of their positions, if Ms. Fernando could provide evidence to support her claims.

“We do not say that any of the officers are perfect. But criticizing everyone at random can lead to a collapse in the jurisdiction and the rule of law,” he said. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
