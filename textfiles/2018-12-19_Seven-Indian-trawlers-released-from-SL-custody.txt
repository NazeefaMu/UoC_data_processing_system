Seven Indian fishing trawlers held by the Sri Lanka Navy, while engaging in illegal fishing in Sri Lankan territorial waters, were released from Sri Lankan custody yesterday with the assistance of the Sri Lanka Coast Guard.

Navy said the released trawlers had been seized in 2015, 2016 and 2017 for trespassing on Sri Lankan territorial waters.

“These trawlers were moored at the jetties of Trincomalee and Jaffna, and were repaired by a dedicated team of Indian engineers who recently arrived in Sri Lanka, before their release,” the Navy said.

Accordingly, the Fast Attack Craft CG 402 of the Sri Lanka Coast Guard assisted the handing over of the seven trawlers to the Indian Coast Guard Ship Ameya at the IMBL north of Kankesanthurei last evening.
