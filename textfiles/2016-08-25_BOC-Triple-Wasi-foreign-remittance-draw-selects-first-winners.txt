Selecting 50 winners, the very first draw of BOC Tripple Wasi was held in “George E. De Silva Garden” in Kandy recently. 
The ceremony was held with the patronage of the Banks Deputy General Manager Treasury, International and Investment Banking Sarath Jayasooriya and the Assistant General Manager International S.M.W. Samarakoone. Prof. Anura Wickramasinghe and Prof. H.M.R. Herath participated in the event as guests of honor. The Bank’s Assistant General Manager Central Province R.P.S Rajapaksha, Assistant General Manager Priyal Silva, Senior Manager Trade Promotion P. Kumara and other bank staff participated at the event. 
The draw was held among customers who sent foreign remittances through Bank of Ceylon during the Avurudu season. Customers who are sending remittances could win up to 3 times the amount remitted by them, in addition to what they have remitted through BOC “Triple Wasi” promotion. 
With the bank’s foreign correspondent network consisting of over 750 correspondent banks and over 101 exchange houses around the world, customers can remit money to Sri Lanka speedily, more securely and conveniently to their loved ones or to their own accounts. Customers who receive foreign remittances through the Bank of Ceylon enjoy the privilege of obtaining money through any of 627 BOC’s branches or any of BOC 521 ATMs located across the country. Customers who receive remittances to their foreign or local currency accounts or simply receive money over the counter through a secret PIN number, are all entitled for this draw. BOC’s Head Office Personal branch at Colombo Fort is kept open 24 X 7 to provide uninterrupted banking services.
To be entitled for the second draw remittances should be sent during June 01st to July 31st 2016 and remittances sent during October 1st to December 31st 2016 will be entitled for the final draw. The Bank will disburse a total sum of Rs.12.5 million among 125 winners during these three draws. Each winner will receive the equivalent of a maximum of Rs.100,000 in Sri Lankan Rupees. Customers will stand more chances of winning by sending multiple remittances through Bank of Ceylon. 
Other than the Bank’s own BOC Smart-remit system, customers can send money through SWIFT, Money Gram, Ez-Remit, Xpressmoney, Ria, Prabhu money and Sigue to any BOC account, to any other bank account or simply to obtain cash over the counter. 
“As a part of the Bank’s digital transformation Process the bank has upgraded its system that all remittances received for BOC accounts will be credited to the account real-time and other bank remittances will be forwarded to respective banks immediately. Enhancing customer convenience the bank also notifies the recipient of the money through an SMS alert as soon as the money is received by the bank,” said S.M.S.C. Jayasuriya, Deputy General Manager- International, Treasury and Investment.
