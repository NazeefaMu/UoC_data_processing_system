Two Bills on Buddhist Affairs to be put off


	

The Government today decided to shelve two pieces of legislation relating to Buddhist Affairs due to objections from the Mahanayake Theras of the various chapters.

The Business Committee of Parliament met today to decide on the items to be taken up for debate this week.

Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said the government would indefinitely postpone the debate on the Buddhist Temporalities (Amendment) Bill and Theravada Bhikkhu Kathikawath Bill.

He said the Government would act on these matters only on the advice of the Mahanayake Theras.

“The Mahanayake Theras want to have the voting rights in the election of the Diyawadana Nilames,” the minister said.

Earlier, the joint opposition’s parliamentary group leader Dinesh Gunawardane also requested for the postponement of the debate. (Kelum Bandara)
