The Parliament complex is likely to inundated if the Ambatale Dam is not renovated and in such a situation a flood hits the Colombo District again, Megapolis Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said yesterday.

He said this when MP S.M. Marikkar pointed out that the government should focus on protecting the Ambatale Tank, which was in a dilapidated stage.

"We made a great effort to prevent the dam from breaching its banks on the previous occasion that floods hit Colombo, and it is high time for us to seriously focus on this matter," the minister said.

He said the renovating the Ambatale Dam was an urgent priority because it had been neglected since its construction during the colonial period. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)
