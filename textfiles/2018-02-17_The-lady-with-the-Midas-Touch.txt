A devout Christian, Siva Obeyesekere broke tradition by challenging the UNP at the Parliamentary election in 1965 by contesting the Mirigama seat, which is a UNP stronghold dominated by a Buddhist population. Although her opponent underestimated the chances of this 36 year old Christian from winning she beat the more experienced Wijayabahu Wijesinghe by an overwhelming majority. In 1970, her opponent was Prof. W.S. Karunaratne, Professor of Buddhism and a Sinhalese who was an eloquent speaker. The crowds, in large number also came to see and hear Siva who was able to reach out to the people with her brand of oratorical skills. Elegantly attired in her signature dress, made of homespun Sri Lankan handlooms and batik sarees, people came from near and far to see and hear Siva mesmerizing her listeners. She won the seat and almost immediately got down to nursing her electorate with a determination to alleviate poverty.
