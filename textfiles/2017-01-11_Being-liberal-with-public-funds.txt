Being liberal with public funds


	



 

It is not unusual for the Ministries and statutory bodies to print diaries and calendars for distribution among well-wishers and clients as a token of goodwill. However, a Ministry handling public funds is said to have brought out a diary for 2017 at an unusually heavy cost, they say. 

 


This attractive diary - each copy costing the exchequer about Rs.8,000 has been printed by a company owned by a ‘nightingale’ domiciled in the UK and it is intended for distribution among a select few, they say.


“What a waste of money at a time the government is in dire straits being strapped for funds even to meet essential public expenditure,” lament the Ministry employees.
