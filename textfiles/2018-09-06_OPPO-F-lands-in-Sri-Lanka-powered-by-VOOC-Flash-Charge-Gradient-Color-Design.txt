Commenting on this launch, Mr. Bob Li, CEO, OPPO Sri Lanka said, “OPPO F9 launched today has bet of both worlds – technological breakthroughs such as VOOC – OPPO’s own patented flash charging technology which lets you charge your phone at a fraction of a time of a normal charging & aesthetic milestones such as the gradient colour body which everyone seemed to have fallen love with. We in Sri Lanka are so excited about OPPO F9 - that even see the waterdrop design in the screen as resembling the shape of Sri Lanka, which incidentally is the first time ever such a ‘water-drop’ design will be introduced to Sri Lanka."

Revolutionary charging: Rapid Charge with VOOC

OPPO found that the most common problem of Sri Lankanusers is battery life. These consumers often land in some awkward situations where they are running out of battery. Keeping these in mind, OPPO F9 comes with VOOC Flash Charge. This technology, independently developed by OPPO, applies low voltage charging technology and has a charging speed up to four times faster than general charging at 5V/1A.  And if you’re in a hurry, a quick 5-minute charge is enough to maintain 2 hours of talk time.

In addition to increasing the charging speed by four times, VOOC also boasts an intelligent five-layer protection system from the adaptor to the port and interior of the phone. VOOC has replaced the voltage reducing circuit with a MCU, making VOOC a cool fast charging tech. You can also use your phone and maintain high speed fast charging, which high voltage fast charge will not be able to support. 

Since OPPO launched VOOC in 2014, VOOC has applied over 500 patents and is used by over 90 million consumers, making VOOC the most mature commercial fast charging technique. In terms of battery life, F9 is equipped with a 3500mAh battery and an optimized AI battery management. It’s fair to say F9 guarantees a great battery life.



Cutting-Edge Design: Waterdrop Screen with Gradient colors

As an increasingly popular smartphone brand among young people, OPPO taps into their tastes in fashion and style to design products with far-reaching appeal. With gradient colors, the youth can showcase their personality and attitude. 

OPPO has three gradient color combinations - Sunrise Red, Twilight Blue and Starry Purple. The Gradient Spraying Technology and “Frame Gradient” tech used by OPPO realizes a perfect combination of gradient design on the back and the user a more unified viewing experience. In the sunlight, the F9 shines like a crystal gem and flowing water. The color design aesthetics of the OPPO F9 reflects both OPPO's design ideology and insights into what aesthetics appeals to young consumers around the globe.

Besides the gradient color design, the F9 screen is also beautiful and appealing. OPPO has always believed a smartphone is not just a tool for communication but also a piece of art. The screen occupies almost all of F9 except for a small droplet shaped notch called the “Waterdrop Screen”, inspired by a water drop.

The F9 comes with an impressive 6.3-inch bezel-less screen that features a resolution of 1080*2340 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9, a super-high screen-to-body ratio of 90.8%.

Unparalleled photography: From Selfie Expert to Portrait Artist

OPPO’s legacy of strong photography is even further enhanced with OPPO F9. While OPPO initially established its expertise as the “Selfie Expert", the brand has now begun to focus on capturing all round beauty. 

For the first time, OPPO F series is equipped with dual rear cameras (16MP + 2MP). There are a few common pain points that a user faces with portrait mode. Firstly, you often get blurry and fake Bokeh effect. Secondly, the lighting condition is complicated, causing images to be either over-exposed or particularly dark. The main camera for F9 at the rear is a 16MP plus f/1.8 aperture lens. This, plus the secondary camera, will calculate the depth-of-field to achieve better Bokeh effect for rear photography.

After the hardware completed Bokeh effect, the F9 portrait mode can use the depth information to add light and apply AI beautification to get an exclusive portrait lighting style.

Users can achieve different effects using Film Light, Natural Light and Rim Light for a great portrait photography experience. In regard to shooting with the rear camera, F9 is equipped with dual cameras to catch every moment. 16 independent and 800 combined scenes can be recognized by AI Scene Recognition.

OPPO F9 25MP front-facing camera also does not disappoint. OPPO F9 can accurately collect 296 feature points for each subject, referencing them against its massive database of facial images, analyzing features before making enhancements, customized for each subject. The AI Beauty Technology 2.1 can provide users with up to 8 million different personalized beautification effects – now selfies are more attractive while keeping the natural look of each human subject intact.

Additionally, F9 supports multiple interesting camera features such as AR Stickers, Super Vivid mode and slow motion video.



Rewarding experience: ColorOS 5.2 AI Intuitive System

Based on Android 8.1, OPPO brings the ColorOS 5.2 Operating System to create a smarter interactive experience for users.  Intelligence is everywhere in ColorOS 5.2. The F9 isequipped with the Google Lens that identifies objects and shows relevant search results and information. 

When it comes to hardware, the 4GB/6GB + 64GB memory combination improves the speed of operation. F9 also supports 256GB memory expansion. To satisfy users with multiple SIM cards, F9 applies a design that contains 3 card slots, two for SIM cards and one for the storage card. 

At the launch, OPPO also announced the OPPO F9 Pro, another variant of the F series family which will be hitting the Sri Lankan market soon.
