However, despite their substantial economic value the country’s SMEs continue to face many challenges. Additionally, with Sri Lanka emerging as a vibrant economy in South Asia poised for aggressive growth through impending preferential trade access with regional countries, it is vital for SMEs to develop and compete internationally.
