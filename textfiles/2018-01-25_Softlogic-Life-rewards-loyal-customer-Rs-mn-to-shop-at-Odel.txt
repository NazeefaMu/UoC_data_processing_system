Bringing joy for Softlogic Life customers who made simple choices to colour their 2017, Sri Lanka’s fastest growing life insurer Softlogic Life successfully concluded a unique customer promotion recently.


Udara Wijesinghe from Wattala was adjudged the grand winner and took home the grand prize of one million Rupees.


As a brand that proactively drives their customers’ quality of life in terms of wellness, fitness and nutrition, Softlogic Life kick started its unique loyalty campaign called ‘Purple Christmas 2017’ for their loyal customers who have been making right choices incessantly throughout 2017. As part of this promotion, customers of Softlogic Life across the country automatically qualified for the competition. Out of all, 12 lucky winners - 10 Softlogic Life policyholders and two Corporate Group policyholders - were selected by Softlogic Life from a draw in December 2017 to participate in an exclusive shopping spree experience that Sri Lankans have never experienced before.


Each winner, alongside his family members, was given Rs.100,000 to participate in a shopping spree challenge at Sri Lanka’s premier fashion retailer Odel that ran for 30 minutes. The adrenaline-filled competition was judged by a panel which comprised of Physical Preparation Manager of the Sri Lankan Cricket team Rob Chave, Calorie Counter Founder and Managing Director Duaine Peiris and Gamya Wijedasa who represented Sri Lanka at the Miss World 2009 pageant; well-known Sri Lankan personalities who are famous among locals for their knowledge and expertise on fitness, wellness and nutrition.


After an intense contest, the final bill of each family was given to the judging panel. Shopping choices and shopping behaviours shown by the participants during the shopping spree were carefully reviewed by these judges and marks were given on the basis of how each participant’s simple choices had added colour to their loved ones’ lives.


The judging panel unanimously decided Udara Wijesinghe to be the grand winner of Purple Christmas 2017 and he walked home with once in a lifetime chance to shop at Odel with one million Rupees.
Expressing why he opted to choose a better life in 2017, Udara stated: “My father passed away untimely due to a non-communicable disease and my mother, for the rest of her life, will have to rely on different medication to improve her medical condition. Though I was unfortunate to witness their suffering, their experience motivated me to make one of the simplest of choices of my life; to choose a healthy lifestyle. I believe the right choices you make will have a lasting impact on you as well as on your family members. I want to see my children grow up and it is crucial for me to stay healthy and be their beacon of hope, when they become better citizens of this country.”


Softlogic Life Managing Director Iftikar Ahamed said: “I congratulate Udara Wijesinghe, who became the grand prize winner of Purple Christmas 2017 and thank all other families who took part in our exciting promotion. The innovative life solutions we have designed for our passionate policyholders are meant to bring quality and add more colour to their lives every day, bringing an extra bit of speciality and uniqueness to make their lives more vibrant during the festive season. This year’s edition of Purple Christmas promotion was rolled out for all our customers who made great and simple choices to make their lives colourful in 2017.”
