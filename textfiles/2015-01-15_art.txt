The Petroleum Corporation has refused to issue fuel to a petrol station in Ambalangoda town which is said to have been owned by a well known politician of the former government due to his failure to pay a sum of Rs. 170 million due to the corporation.
Motorist say they have been terribly inconvenienced as a result of the fuel station not having fuel as only two fuel stations existed for the supply of fuel in the Ambalangoda Town. The only fuel station left for them was the one owned by the co-operative society which was now becoming crowded as a result.
A spokesman of the Petrol Station Owners Association said that the fuel was supplied by the Petroleum Corporation in Kolonnawa after the money was paid to the Corporation’s account. They said that the Corporation supplies the fuel according to terms and conditions of a circular.
The employees complained that the former Chairman and staff of the Corporation had supplied fuel to the errant owner of the petrol station in Ambalangoda, contravening the rules and regulations of the circular and thereby causing a huge loss to the Corporation.
It is said that nearly one million had to be paid for a bowser of petrol, because the fuel ordered by this petrol station owner from the corporation in Kolonnawa was supplied from the Regional Fuel Store in Galle adding that Rs. 750,000 had to be paid per bowser containing 6600 litres of diesel and that the profit from one bowser was only Rs. 15000 from which they had to pay salaries to the workers.
The owner of the petrol station was said to be former monitoring MP of External Affairs and former Galle District, Sajin de Vaas Gunewardena. (Janath de Silva and Chandrasiri Jasenthuliyana)
