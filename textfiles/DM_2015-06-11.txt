Seylan frees credit card holders for first time in Sri Lanka
	
Seylan Bank PLC unveiled yet another groundbreaking product - Freedom credit card partnering with MasterCard at a recent press briefing to fulfil the needs of its every potential credit card holder.
The credit card in the process excludes the need to pay traditional fees and any other fees that would free its users from the discomfort of monthly expenses.
For the first time in Sri Lanka a credit card has been launched with no fees, basically we have taken away all the fees -- annual fee, joining fee, late payment fee, over limit fee, enhancement fee, etc., said Seylan Bank Chief Manager Cards Nimesh Fernando.
Every customer who earns a basic of Rs.50,000 or with a fixed deposit of Rs.100,000 is entitled to own the card with the additional benefit of only 20 percent nominal interest per annum.
The credit card holders are expected to spend a minimum of Rs.10,000 per month and those who do not reach this limit would be charged with just Rs.500 per month.
Decades of experience and intensive research has helped us clearly identify the different kinds of credit card users and allowed us to tailor our products to suit each type of customer. We found that while consumers appreciate the security and convenience offered by credit cards, they are increasingly weary of the plethora of fees charged, Seylan Bank Director and Chief Executive Officer Kapila Ariyaratne said.
Seylan Bank has identified customers who use the card on a monthly basis who could easily spend Rs.10,000 on a monthly basis, Fernando added.
Simply speaking, they can have the card but we need to get a commitment of Rs.10,000 a month, the only fee we would charge if at all is Rs.500 if the customer does not keep the commitment, he elaborated.
Just because the customers do not have to pay fees doesnt mean they do not get to enjoy offers that Seylan Bank has been offering, he further added, explaining about the privileges and special discounts of a MasterCard that can benefit its users.
Thus, Freedom credit card holders are subjected to many perks as a result of Seylan Banks trusted excellence.

SL to raise up to $2bn in foreign borrowings
	
	Sri Lanka's new government plans to borrow up to $2.0 billion from overseas, the finance minister said Thursday, just two weeks after raising a billion through its first international bond issue.
	Minister Ravi Karunanayake said the government was seeking at least $1.0 billion with a five-year tenure, but may increase the loan amount to $2.0 billion depending on the market response.
	"Tomorrow we will advertise and call for bids. We hope to collect $1.0 billion in a couple of days. It would even go up to $2.0 billion," Karunanayake said.
	The move to raise foreign cash comes amid rising domestic spending and shortfalls in revenue collection, the minister said, while accusing the previous administration of overstating revenues and under estimating expenditure.
	"We want to borrow at low interest rates to pay off the high interest loans taken by the previous government," the minister told the Foreign Correspondents' Association of Sri Lanka.
	The Central Bank of Sri Lanka last month raised $988 million through the combination of a 10-year bond and shorter term bonds at a weighted average cost of 5.261 percent a year.
	The government has increased welfare spending and reduced the price of fuel and utilities in line with election promises ahead of the January 8 presidential vote won by Maithripala Sirisena.
	Despite a marginal improvement in tax collection, President Sirisena's government is hard pressed for cash to meet new spending commitments.

Champika objects compensation to LTTE cadres
	
Minister of Power and Energy and Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) General Secretary Patali Champika Ranawaka said today the cabinet paper submitted to grant government compensation for injured LTTE terrorists had to be withdrawn after he protested against it.
Some ministers submitted a cabinet paper proposing that the injured LTTE terrorists should be compensated by the government. I strongly objected it and it had to be withdrawn, he said.
Minister Ranawaka said JHU was strongly opposed to hosting a festival of Diaspora as claimed by the Foreign Affairs Ministry and that hosting such a discussion would instigate racisms and terrorism.
There has been no discussion within the government about this. We do not think hosting such a discussion with organizations banned by the defense ministry through a gazette notification would ensure peace in the country. It is an instigation of terrorism, Mr. Ranawaka said.
He said if this issue was to be resolved, those Tamil Diaspora organizations should accept the unitary state of the country and that such issues could not be resolved holding discussions while they were still stick to Tamil Eelam and added that it was done to achieve petty political ends.
This government has not received any mandate to have discussion with separatists. It should obtain a mandate to have such discussions, he said. (Ajith Siriwardana)

Appointments of new ministers: Acts of political bribery-JVP
	
The recent appointments of four deputy ministers were acts of political bribery by President Maithripala Sirisena to retain power, Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) General Secretary Tilvin Silva charged today.
While slamming the decision to appoint more ministers, he said the incumbent government was following the footsteps of the previous government in expanding the Cabinet of Ministers.
There is no political requirement to appoint a new set of ministers. We are completely against this decision. We can only assume that the appointments were given for narrow political gains, he told a news conference held at party headquarters.
Mr. Silva said that a proposal was included in the 19th Amendment to the Constitution which was enacted recently, to limit the number of ministers in a government because of the peoples displeasure received for maintaining a jumbo cabinet in the past.
He claimed that the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) had split into two factions today, one supporting President Maithripala Sirisena and another backing former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. He said the ministerial appointments were attempts of strengthening Maithripala faction.
Former Prime Minister D.M. Jayaratne had been appointed as a senior adviser to the President today. Mr. Rajapaksa also did the very same thing. He made numerous appointments to secure the two thirds majority in the parliament. Though Mr. Rajapaksa was defeated, the political culture he followed still continues, Mr. Silva said.
Meanwhile, Propaganda Secretary Vijitha Hearth said the 20th Amendment to the Constitution is being delayed because of cold war brewing in the SLFP. (Lahiru Pothmulla and Sanath Desmond)

Australia denies officials paid refugee smugglers
	
Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop has denied claims by Indonesian police that Australian Customs officials paid thousands of dollars to people smugglers to take asylum seekers back to Indonesia, ABC News reported.
A boat carrying 65 asylum seekers crashed onto a reef near the remote Rote Island, off West Papua, last week and those on board said Australian authorities had turned them back.
Rote Island's police chief said the captain of the boat, a man called Yohanis from North Sulawesi, told police an Australian Customs official paid each crew member $5,000 to bring asylum seekers back to Indonesia.
A Sri Lankan asylum seeker called Kajuran told ABC News a similar story, but the claim was difficult to understand or verify.
"They picked up money. [An] Australian man, Customs, he gave money," Kajuran had told the ABC in broken Bahasa Indonesia. "They made a deal."
Deputy senior police commissioner Hidayat said the Customs officer was called Agus and spoke fluent Bahasa Indonesia.
Hidayat said the boat crew, who are still under arrest, asked police to help send the money to their wives and police agreed.
He said it was their money because it was not received from people smugglers.
Indonesian laws that cover people smuggling prohibit helping people leave or enter the country without permission and benefiting from doing so.
The boat crew will still be charged with attempting to take people out of Indonesian territory.
When asked whether Australian authorities ever paid people to return asylum seekers, Ms Bishop had replied: "No."

Dubai - A 49-year-old unemployed man faced charges on Thursday for allegedly molesting a 3-year-old boy on the beach.

The nanny said that she was surprised by the man kissing the boy on the lips.
When I asked him about the reason behind what he did, he insulted me. He also told me it was none of my business and that I was only the boys nanny.
She called the police adding that the way the defendant kissed the little boy was inappropriate.
Another Filipina housemaid, 48, said that she was with the nanny and the boy at the time of the incident. She confirmed having seen the defendant sitting on his knees in front of the boy, who was then playing, kissing him and then giving him a rose.
A police sergeant quoted the accused as admitting to have kissed the kid. He claimed the kiss was spontaneous and did not mean anything.
A verdict will be pronounced on July 9. (khaleejtimes)

MPs with no A/Levels, questioning CC: CaFFE
	
It was ironic that MPs who were among the 142 MPs who hadnt passed their Advanced Level, were questioning the qualifications of the three members nominated to the Constitutional Council (CC), the CaFFE organisation said today.
We have identified that a number of MPs, who were infamous for election law violations, election related violence, abusing State property, attempted intimidation of public servants and bribe voters, are at the forefront of the campaign to stop the CC being appointed, Executive Director of CaFFE Keerthi Tennakoon said.
Campaign for Free and Fair Elections (CaFFE) is an election watchdog in the country and had been vociferously in support of the 19th and 20th Amendments to the Constitution.
A number of MPs, including National Freedom Front (NFF) Leader Wimal Weerawansa, questioned the qualifications of the three nominated civil members to the CC, Dr. A.T. Ariyaratne, Dr. Radhika Coomarswamy and A.W.A. Salam, Tennakoon said.
These are Parliamentarians who havent even passed their Advanced Levels in school, he said.
Tennakoon said that with the failure of Parliament to come to a consensus on the three civil members, the activities of the Bribery Commission and the appointment of the Elections Commissioner have come to a standstill. (DS)

Audio: No bus fare hike - LPBOA
	
	Bus fares would not be increased as claimed by certain persons, who claimed to be the general secretary of a private bus federation, President of the Lanka Private Bus Owners Association (LPBOA) Gemunu Wijerathne said today.
	The General Secretary of the All Island Private Bus Company Federation (AIPBCF) Anjana Priyanjith said on Wednesday that he had planned to request a bus fare increase of ten per cent with the increase of minimum fare to Rs.10 from the National Transport Commission (NTC).
	However, Wijeratne rejected the claim.
	As LPBOA we have not taken any plan to request a bus fare increase. The annual review of bus fares falls on July 1. When revising bus fares twelve factors are taken into consideration; Diesel cost, employee salaries, servicing and oil, tyre and tubes, air condition service and repairs, daily expenses, monthly expenses, annual expenses and the finance cost, he said.
	The bus fare increment is not for the private buses but also for the government services. There had been sixteen increases, while the fare had been revised down only four times, Mr. Wijerathne said.
	There are eleven ministers, who own buses in the private bus industry and it is a great loss to the bus industry. The Internal Transport Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara had taken a decision to terminate the semi-luxury bus service and the super luxury services, which had a devastating impact on the entire bus service in the country, he said.
	This type of category is not found anywhere in the world. This is a malpractice introduced by the previous government.
	A new facility will be introduced in the near future to grant ten per cent discount for commuters, who use the electronic pre-paid Touch Travel Pass card, he said.(Chaturanga Pradeep)
