New entry period for US Diversity Visa


	

The registration period for the US diversity visa (DV-2019) has been revised due to technical issues, the US Embassy said today.

In a statement, it said the new entry period would be open for electronic entries on October 18 from 11:00 am to November 22 until 11:00 am.

Due to the new entry period, all entries made prior to October 18, 2017 should be resubmitted for the entrant to be considered, it said.

The technical issue was the failure to properly account for country of eligibility if the entrant was selecting a country of eligibility other than his/her place of birth, which is permitted in certain limited circumstances.

“This was not a result of any outside interference or hacking attempt. We regret the inconvenience to Diversity Visa entrants. In order to ensure fairness and protect the integrity of the process for all those concerned, however, we must restart the entry process for this year (DV-2019).

An application entered before Wednesday, October 18, 2017 will not be considered and another entry must be submitted during the new registration period,” the statement said.

Applicants may submit one new entry without being disqualified for submitting multiple entries.

Individuals who submit more than one entry during the new registration period will be disqualified.

Applicants can access the electronic DV entry form (E-DV) at the official E-DV website, dvlottery.state.gov, during the registration period. DV instructions are also available on the Department of State’s public webpage at usvisas.state.gov/dv/instructions. All other eligibility requirements remain the same.

Beginning May 15, 2018, DV-2019 entrants will be able to use their unique confirmation number provided at registration to check the online Entrant Status Check at dvlottery.state.gov to see if their entry was selected.

Entrant Status Check will inform successful entrants how to apply for DVs for themselves and their eligible family members. The Department will also confirm visa interview appointments through the Entrant Status Check.
