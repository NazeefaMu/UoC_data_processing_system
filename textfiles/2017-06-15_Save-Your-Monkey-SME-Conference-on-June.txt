Save Your Monkey (SYM) an online insurance product comparison platform that debuted recently has embarked on a new initiative to empower small and medium-sized businesses in the country. 
The new initiative by the company looks to empower small and medium-sized businesses in the country to protect themselves against possible risks, especially in light of the events that the country has experienced lately.  
As the initial step to this initiative SYM is offering all small and medium enterprises (SMEs) the opportunity to be a part the first SYM SME conference which will be held on 16th June. The conference will focus on understanding the importance of insurance for SMEs along with valuable knowledge that will allow business owners to make well-informed and independent decisions when purchasing a policy.  The conference, which will be accessible to anyone free of charge, will be facilitated by Hiran De Mel, Head of Insurance at SYM Insurance Brokers, an expert in the field with over 3 decades of experience both in the corporate sector and the insurance industry.

The main objective of the SYM SME conference is to give more transparency to the benefits of insurance and to help business owners understand how to plan their financial investments, while including insurance to their list of priorities. Those who attend the event will also have the opportunity to discuss their options with insurance consultants at SYM and to establish a safer and risk-free a way forward for their business.
