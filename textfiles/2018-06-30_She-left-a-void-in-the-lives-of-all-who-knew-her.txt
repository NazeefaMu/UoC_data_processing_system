Peace Emilda Devapriya Somaratne (nee Karunaratne)

 

“ For to me, to live is Christ, and to die is gain” Philipians 1:21  
My beloved sister Devapriya went to be with her Precious Lord Jesus on the 21st of December 2017. It’s hard to accept that we won’t see her smiling face, or hear her gentle voice, encouraging, comforting and guiding us.   


Akka was born on the 18th of April 1943, the second in a family of five. She was just fifteen months older than me. Though we were totally unlike each other in looks and temperament, we were often mistaken for twins. We were the best of friends, studying and playing together. It was hard for me when we were separated at the O’ Level class, when she went into the Arts stream as she excelled in Arts subjects, and I was selected to do Science.  


Akka made a distinctive contribution as a student to Methodist College, being appointed a prefect for two years; as House vice captain for one year, and captain the other. She was also the leader of the Sinhala debating team, and a member of the English debating team. 

 
She entered the University of Peradeniya in 1961 to read for a Bachelor of Arts Degree in Economics. During this time there was a revival of Sinhala Drama under the influence of Prof. Ediriweera Sarathchandra. This exposure gave her the vision and skill to direct “Chora Pabbathaya” and “Sakkaya Ditthi” two highly successful, stylized Sinhala dramas.  

 


Akka was the epitome of simplicity often dressed in white. She shunned jewellery, wearing only a simple pair of ear studs. Her adornment was her beautiful smile, which radiated her goodness and inner peace


 


She married Professor G.P.V. Somaratne in 1966 and accompanied him when he went to London to read for his PhD in History. She was his devoted and caring wife for 52 years.  


On their return to Sri Lanka in 1969, she joined the tutorial Staff of her Alma Mater Methodist College. She was a gifted teacher, having the skill to kindle an interest in the subjects she taught: History, Sinhala and Economics, in the O’ Level and A’ Level classes. She was a strict disciplinarian, but earned the warm affection and loyalty of her students, as they sensed her genuine concern and interest in their welfare.  


Students and staff alike were devastated when akka gave up teaching in 1982. She had been invited to join a team who had taken on the challenge of editing a new Sinhala translation of the Holy Bible, spearheaded by the Ceylon Bible Society. She felt that part-time involvement was insufficient to do justice to such a tremendous task. 


Though she loved being a teacher, she willingly gave it up, as she was convinced that this was God’s calling for her. She was also responsible for editing a Sinhala Study Bible, which had hitherto not existed. She got actively involved in supporting her husband in helping with research, editing and proof-reading the many books he wrote in the past two decades which have enriched Christian literature. She was indeed “the wind beneath his wings”.  


Akka was the epitome of simplicity often dressed in white. She shunned jewellery, wearing only a simple pair of ear studs. Her adornment was her beautiful smile, which radiated her goodness and inner peace. Akka’s compassion and caring knew no bounds. She would reach out to those in need, those who were hurting, and was able to comfort, encourage and heal.She was always ready to lend a helping hand, paying the school fees of less affluent students at Methodist College, providing a regular supply of dry rations to families who were struggling economically, all without publicity or fanfare.The daily maid who helped her with cleaning, tearfully told me that akka had given her Rs. 1000 to buy Christmas gifts for her two little boys just before she was admitted to hospital in December.  


Akka was a gifted speaker, but she never showed off. She never used big words or high flown theology. Her words were simple, and touched the hearts of her listeners, and made an indelible impact on them. When she prayed, we felt that she had a ‘hot line’ to Jesus.   


Akka has a son Dasharatha (a Chaplain in the US Army) and a daughter Prarthana Devi (a Primary School Teacher), both who reside in the US. She provided them with love, support, and guidance and most of all inculcated in them a steadfast love for their Savior Jesus. These two well balanced, outstanding young people are witness to her good parenting. Akka has eight grand children and five great grand children. She was the beloved “Priya akka” to her many cousins and a much loved “Loku achchi” to her grand nieces and nephews.  


After akka’s demise, many of her past pupils at Methodist College, scattered in Sri Lanka and abroad contacted me to express their sympathy. Many stated that they are who they are today because of the sound moral and Christian values that were instilled in them by their beloved teacher at a young and impressionable age.  


Goodbye my dearest akka. Your departure has left an aching void in our lives. We will hold you in our hearts, and find comfort in the sure knowledge that you are safe in the arms of Jesus. We look forward to the glorious day when we will meet again, beyond the sun set.
