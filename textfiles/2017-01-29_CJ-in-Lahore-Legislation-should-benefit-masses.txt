CJ in Lahore: Legislation should benefit masses


	

Chief Justice K. Sripavan yesterday underlined the need for legislation that could directly benefit the masses and all those approaching the courts in search of justice.

Addressing the SAARC Law Conference in Karachchi, Pakistan, he agreed with his counterpart from Pakistan that both Bar and the bench must play their role for the cause.

“SAARC countries must make concerted efforts in this regard,” he said.

Justice Sripavan said that supremacy of law was a prerequisite for the prosperity and healthy growth of any society.

Meanwhile, Chief Justice of Pakistan Mian Saqib Nisar said the Judiciary had Constitutional Rights to prevent administration from misusing its powers.

The CJP said it was incumbent upon the Judiciary to protect the fundamental Rights of people in general.

He particularly referred to the Suo Motu (on its own motion) notice taken recently by the Supreme Court about the plight of the child Tayyaba.

Senior advocate of Supreme Court of India, K.K. Venugopal, the keynote speaker, made his presentation titled “Poverty – An Alarming Violation of Human Rights.”

He said that the test of progress for any country was not that it had added to the abundance of those who already had much, but whether the country could provide to those who had too little.  

The event concluded with a discussion on success and failure in the SAARC.
