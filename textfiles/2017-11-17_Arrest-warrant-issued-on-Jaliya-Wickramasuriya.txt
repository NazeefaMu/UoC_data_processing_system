Colombo Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne today issued an arrest warrant on former Sri Lankan Ambassador to the United States, Jaliya Wickramasuriya.

Mr. Wickramasuriya was earlier arrested for allegedly misappropriating funds allocated for purchasing a building for the Sri Lankan Embassy in US. He was later released on bail by the Colombo Fort Magistrate.

Mr. Wickramasuriya had gone abroad citing medical treatment as the cause. The arrest warrant was issued since he failed to appear in the court today when the case was taken up for hearing.

The Magistrate also issued notices on the persons who signed as securities to grant bail for the accused. (Yoshitha Perera)
