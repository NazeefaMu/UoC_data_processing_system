The Sri Lankan government does not condone any form of torture, Foreign Affairs Ministry Secretary Prasad Kariyawasam told the third Universal Periodic Review (UPR) of Sri Lanka in Geneva on Wednesday.

Responding to questions and concerns raised by other nations, Mr. Kariyawasam said Sri Lanka seeks to work with all including bilateral partners as well as international organisations, to seek assistance in terms of sharing experience and expertise as well as technical support to ensure the elimination of torture and to prosecute anyone responsible.

He said disciplinary action had been taken against 33 members of police for assault and torture and one officer had been dismissed in 2017 up to date.

“Disciplinary matters against 100 police officers are pending. In 2017, 28 complaints of assault and torture had been received so far,” he said.

Meanwhile, the representative of the Attorney General’s Department told the forum that the government maintains zero tolerance on hate speech and religious violence. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
