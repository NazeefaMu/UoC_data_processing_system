Black flag campaign in Vavuniya


	

A group of Tamils in Vavuniya held a black flag campaign this morning saying the Tamils in the Northern Province were unable to celebrate the 68th Independence Day in freedom.
The protest was launched by the Collective of the Families of Disappeared Persons and the citizens committee in the Vavuniya district.

“Even though the war has come to an end, many Tamils are detained as political prisoners. The Government is still not able to provide any information about the people who disappeared during the war and resettlement in the north has not been completed. In such a situation, Tamils in the North are not in a position to celebrate Independence Day in freedom,” the protestors claimed. (Romesh Madushanka)
