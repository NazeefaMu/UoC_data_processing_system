Twenty four ex-LTTE detainees were today released on strict bail conditions after providing sureties from their places of residence.
They are a section of the 31 ex-LTTE detainees, who were earlier released on strict bail conditions by the Colombo Magistrate’s Court yesterday but had to return to prison because they were unable to provide sureties as specified by Court.WATCH
