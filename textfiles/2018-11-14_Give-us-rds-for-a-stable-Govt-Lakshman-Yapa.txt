Give us 2/3rds for a stable Govt.: Lakshman Yapa


	

UPFA MP Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena said today they were prepared to form a stable government after rectifying their previous mistakes if they were given a two-thirds majority at the general elections.

He told a media briefing at the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) head office that they were drafting a manifesto to bring about a huge transformation in Sri Lanka.

“We are only asking the people to give us a 2/3rds majority at the election. Today, the people understand that the country cannot be taken forward without a stable government. We made several changes but there were allegations against us in certain sectors. We will rectify our mistakes and provide the people a better administration,” Mr. Abeywardena said.

He said they had appointed a committee to prepare a manifesto aimed at the general election and the committee would come up with ways to revive the economy.

“Our main focus is to revive the economy. Sri Lanka’s tea production is today ranked fifth in the world. We have to change that. Without giving into IMF demands, we will strengthen our rural economy,” he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
