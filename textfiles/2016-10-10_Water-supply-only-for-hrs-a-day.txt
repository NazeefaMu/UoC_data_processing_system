The 24 hour water supply will be curtailed to 18 hours a day in the near future, due to the adverse drought conditions prevalent in the country, National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB) Chairman K.A. Ansar said.

Ansar said they looked forward to public support to collect water for those affected by the drought while conserving remaining water resources.

“We will be at risk if we supply water in a continuous manner during such weather,” Ansar said.  (Jayantha Samarakon)
