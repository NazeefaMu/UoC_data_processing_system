Health and Nutrition Minister Rajitha Senaratne, in his first public address after recovery from a heart surgery at Mount Elizabeth Hospital in Singapore, said yesterday he intended building three similar hospitals in Sri Lanka with financial backing from Russia, Austria and Germany.

At the ceremony at BMICH, the minister appearing for the the first time in public after his by-pass surgery, said the Health Ministry would train health staff with the assistance of TEMASEC Foundation in Singapore to further develop the health sector and make our free health service more meaningful.

Commenting on the joint opposition, he said the gentlemen in Geneva knew quite well the joint opposition and the good governance in Sri Lanka and were capable of separating milk from water.

He said one must not get anxious over the venomous tongue wagging against Sri Lanka in Geneva by members of the joint opposition.

Commenting on his recuperation at Mount Elizabeth, the minister said he was treated by a Sri Lanka doctor named Sivadasan and added the hospital was generous and patient-friendly. (Sandun A Jayasekera)
