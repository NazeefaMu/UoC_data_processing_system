The Body Shop in Sri Lanka is ensuring that you don’t neglect your skin this Summer, with the introduction of free skincare consultations at all three of its stores in Sri Lanka.

Trained beauty specialists will be on hand to offer their expertise on how best to take care ofskin during the dry and dusty period, with an extraordinary new product that not just effectively deep cleanses but also moisturisesand vitalises dull skin.

Through The Body Shop’s one on one consultations, customers will receive personalised advice on how to implement cleansing into their daily morning skincare routine, or even when removing make-up at the end of the day. 

The Intensely Revitalising Cleansing Oil-in-Gel from The Body Shop is a matchless new addition to the nourishing Oils of Life™ skincare range; an essential upgrade to an everyday skincare routine during the hot Summer months. 

Suitable for all skin types, its unique texture undergoes a sensorial transition from a rich, gel-like texture on application, into a light, milk lotion once in contact with water; removing residual impurities and leaving skin feeling supple and moisturised for an entire 72 hours.

As its name suggests, the Intensely Revitalising Cleansing Oil-in-Gel is in essence a rejuvenator. The cleanser is infused with a blend of three precious seed oils; black cumin oil from Egypt, rosehip oil from Chile and camelia oil from China; rich in antioxidants, oleic acid, and omega 3 and 6 respectively. This exceptional formula, additionally enriched with 18% Community Trade olive oil, protects against free radical damage, helps nourish, and also protects the skin’s natural moisture barrier.

For skin that looks as smooth and radiant as it feels, the new Intensely Revitalising Cleansing Oil-in-Gel and entire Oils of Life™ skincare range will be made available at The Body Shop flagship store at the Fairline Building near Bagatale Road, and outlets at Odel Alexandra Place and at the Kandy City Centre.

For free consultations customers are advised to contact the store on 011 5765656 (Bagatale Road Outlet) 081 2233008 (KCC Outlet) 0772102777 (Odel outlet)to schedule an appointment in advance.
