Auditors go red on MP remarks


	

Sri Lanka Audit Service Association yesterday warned of tough action if the reports and queries of the Auditor General were continuously rebuked publicly, in an attempt to create a public opinion against the legitimacy and validity of them.

Recently, the Government MPs tried to rubbish the Auditor General’s reports on the Central Bank Bond sale, and the State borrowings in excess of the approved limit.

Also, Government MP Nalin Bandara Jayamaha, disputed an audit query regarding the coal transaction.

Commenting on the latest trend of disputing Auditor General’s reports, Association Chairman Nayana Kumara told the Daily Mirror that Auditors would keep an eye whether this would be done continuously.

He said such criticism would compromise legitimacy of the Auditor General’s queries and reports and erode public confidence in them.

“If the trend continues, we will definitely take action. Otherwise, people will lose,” he said.

Besides, he stressed the need to legislate on National Auditing by Parliament.

“The Finance Minister has assured that the National Audit Bill would be presented in Parliament within the next fortnight. We wait till then,” he said. (Kelum Bandara)
