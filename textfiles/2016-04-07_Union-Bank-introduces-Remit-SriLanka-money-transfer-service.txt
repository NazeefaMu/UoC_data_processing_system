It is an ideal solution for today’s busy individuals, since it allows money transfers via an online portal accessible even via mobile devices - to anyone living in Sri Lanka and has a valid, active bank account. I’m confident that this latest addition to the gamut of progressive retail banking facilities provided by the bank will afford enhanced convenience to our clients and enrich their banking experience with Union Bank.”
