Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake said yesterday they would support the Constitution-making process based on several facts including the abolishing of the executive presidency and changing of the electoral system.

The JVP MP told Parliament that the constitution was meant to protect the social and economic policy of the country and added that they were against that policy and the constitution in general.
He said however they would support the constitution making process on the aspect of making democratic reforms.

He said they were of the opinion that a new constitution should be introduced as the present constitution had been amended 19 times mainly to ensure the power of the government in office.

“We will participate in the constitution making solely to abolish the executive presidency which was detrimental to the country. The democracy could not be upheld while maintaining the executive presidency and it should be abolished to protect the peoples' rights and uphold democracy,” he said.

Mr. Dissanayake said the electoral system also should be changed and added that if parliamentary electoral system was to be changed, it should be done within the constitution not by amending it.

He said the constitution should ensure equal rights of all communities and added that no faction should participate in the constitution making with racial ideology. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)
