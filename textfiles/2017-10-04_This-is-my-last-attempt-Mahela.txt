Soon after accepting a request to join a Cricket Advisory Committee formed by the Minister of Sports, former Sri Lanka skipper Mahela Jayawardena said this would be his last attempt to help transform the game. Jayawardena is part of the six-member committee headed by Hemaka Amarasuriya to make sweeping changes to the way Sri Lanka Cricket is administered and the game is managed.

This committee also comprises three former national captains--Anura Tennakoon, Aravinda de Silva and Kumar Sangakkara-- the Director General of the Sports Medicine Unit Dr. Lakshman Edirisinghe and Ruwan Keragala (Secretary). A few years back Mahela Jayawardena prepared a blueprint on lifting the standard of domestic cricket but this was left to collect dust.

“I wasted a good one year last time making recommendations. I sincerely hope whatever we proposed will be implemented for the good of the game,” Jayawardena said. “This is my last attempt and if I see things are not moving the way we expect, I will definitely quit.
