Dissident SLFP MPs pick holes in the budget

Dissident SLFP Parliamentarians who met President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday voiced concern over the budget proposals noting that they were based on the policies of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and not that of the President.
Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) Parliamentarians representing what they call the joint opposition
in Parliament met President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday morning to air their views concerning Budget 2016 that was presented in Parliament by Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake last week.
These MPs on Monday (23) requested a separate meeting with the President to discuss issues in the Budget that was presented.
Speaking to Daily News a Senior Parliamentarian representing the ‘joint opposition’ said that during the election period President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe had presented two policies and that the current Budget was according to the policy of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
The parliamentarian added that the MPs of their group could not agree to such a budget that is detrimental to the people. He added that 14 points were raised regarding the Budget presented by Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake including, the plan to merge the Employee Provident Fund and Employees Trust Fund, the deception that shows as allocation of close to 6% for education, the tax on vehicles and the disregard shown to the farmers .
The parliamentarian further added that while the President had acknowledged several shortcomings in the budget had agreed to set up a meeting between Prime Minister Wickremesinghe ,Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake and the Opposition MPs from the SLFP before the vote of the budget, to discuss the issues that were raised at the meeting.
The MPs during the discussion with the President also raised several privilege issues faced by the SLFP opposition MPs in Parliament. The MPs are not allocated sufficient time to present their views and only the Tamil National Alliance and Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna MPs are allowed to speak, he added. The TNA always speaks about the LTTE, while the JVP is whitewashing the UNP, he stated. The MP further added that opposition MPs from the SLFP were not part of COPE or any other committee of importance and this was also raised with the President.
