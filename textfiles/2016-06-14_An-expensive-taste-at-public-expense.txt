An expensive taste at public expense


	

Believe it or not! The head of a state-owned commercial establishment has purchased three coats at a cost of Rs.3 million!




One of these coats had cost Rs.1.8 million. The other two had cost Rs.800,000 and Rs.400,000 respectively.


This dude is said to be the only white collar bigwig in state service going in for expensive coats. 
Employees of the commercial establishment say that even the heir to the British throne may not be wearing such expensive coats as their boss.
