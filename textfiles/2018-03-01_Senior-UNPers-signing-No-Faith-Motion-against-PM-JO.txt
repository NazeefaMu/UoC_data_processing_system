The Joint Opposition today said several stalwarts of United National Party (UNP) had started signing for the No-Confidence Motion, which was to be brought against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.

Joint Opposition member MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage told a news conference that they would support for the No-Confidence Motion against Prime Minister Wickremesinghe and it would be presented in Parliament in the coming days.

“Earlier we have planned to bring a No-Confidence Motion against Prime Minister Wickremesinghe however it was delayed.

“We will sign for the No-Confidence Motion and would remove Prime Minister Wickremesinghe from his post,” he said.

He said the most significant fact was that powerful members attached to the UNP would support the No-Confidence Motion and added that they were currently signing it. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)
