Dreadlocks and poets herald new face of Spanish Parliament

SPAIN: When Alberto Rodriguez of Podemos turned up for the new Spanish parliament's first session in the grand chamber in Madrid, his dreadlocks, jeans and scruffy jumper drew a look of disapproval from the staid prime minister, Mariano Rajoy.
Such scenes are likely to become commonplace with the end of two-party domination of Spanish politics and a new wave of delegates takes their seats alongside the well-groomed ranks of the old guard.
It is more than just a style issue, however.
The national election on Dec. 20 left Rajoy's ruling People's Party (PP) without a majority and opened parliament's doors to two new parties, the anti-austerity Podemos and the centrist Ciudadanos.
Rodriguez, 34, and his cohorts want to reform a political class tainted by its handling of Spain's economic crisis and corruption scandals that have reached as high as Rajoy himself.
"Rajoy has not understood that we are in a new political era in which parliament is not the private reserve of the few," Rodriguez, a former oil refinery worker, told reporters when he made his parliamentary debut last week.
Although the 218 first-time delegates in the 350-seat lower house mark only a slight increase from five years ago when Rajoy won a comfortable majority, they come from diverse backgrounds - from actresses and poets to restaurant-owners and winemakers.
Party leaders are now wrangling over forming a government, with the opposition Socialist's leader, Pedro Sanchez, proposing a leftist coalition and Rajoy a "grand coalition" of centre-right and centre-left parties.
Podemos says the fuss kicked up by the traditional parties over Rodriguez and his dreadlocks was to distract people from the problems at hand. Despite a rebound in the economy, Spain still has Europe's second-highest youth unemployment rate.
"It is a symptom of how the political class want to prevent change," said Sofia Castanon, a well-known poet and Podemos delegate for Asturias, a mountainous region on Spain's northern coast.
Parliament had lost the trust of Spaniards, Castanon told, and Podemos would restore it by eliminating the privileges politicians had enjoyed, such as official cars, generous tax allowances and special pension schemes.
Podemos leader Pablo Iglesias has restricted his lawmakers' salaries to three times the minimum wage of 757 euros ($824) a month, a change Castanon, 32, said showed how the party was in touch with Spain's economic reality.
Political analysts said that how far the new parliament could go in changing the course of Spanish politics remains to be seen, especially if the next government is a fragile coalition of many parties that could struggle to agree on a strong reform agenda.
