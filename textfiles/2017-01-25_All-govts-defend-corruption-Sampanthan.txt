All govts. defend corruption: Sampanthan


	

All governments, past and present, defend the corrupt, said Opposition Leader R Sampanthan yesterday.

Speaking during an adjournment debate in the House, Mr. Sampanthan said corruption was endemic in the country.

“Parties hit each other on corruption during elections. This government is also being attacked on corruption. One party is defeated and another party comes to power. However corruption continues. They blame each other, but do nothing to end corruption. People are getting sick of this situation,” he said

“Corruption might end democracy in this country. Nepotism and dictatorship have always followed rampant corruption in many countries. People who are guilty are not punished. Is there anyone who was punished by a court for corruption? There is no one. You are just fooling the people,” he said. (Yohan Perera)
