'Hello' There - Adele's First Song in Three Years

Remember how Adele made you feel all the feels with every single song she ever wrote? Well, she's done it again.
With her debut album, 19, in 2008 and then with her sophomore album, 21, in 2011, Adele sung her way into the hearts of people all around the world. Then she just disappeared.
Now she's back and greeting her fans with a new single, conveniently titled "Hello." The emotional black-and-white music video was directed by Canadian filmmaker/actor, Xavier Dolan.
Adele fans will not be disappointed with this heart wrenching ballad. Seriously, there have been so many times that the world needed the 27-year-old singer's impossibly powerful vocals and emotional lyrical dexterity.
While 21 was her last album, Adele did croon the theme song, Skyfall, for the 2012 James Bond movie of the same name. This hit even earned her an Oscar. "Hello," which was released early Friday morning, is the first single off her upcoming album 25, which comes out Nov. 20.
Adele wrote an open letter on Facebook recently about her new album. "My last record was a breakup record and if I had to label this one I would call it a make-up record.
I'm making up with myself," she said. "Making up for lost time. Making up for everything I ever did and never did." It sounds like this could be her most poignant album yet, which is equal parts scary and exciting.
Adele announced the track list for 25 as well, with songs titled "Send My Love (To Your New Lover)," "When We Were Young," "Water Under the Bridge," "Love in the Dark" and "I Miss You."
It sounds like fans might never stop crying when listening to Adele's powerful, raw emotional music. Yahoo
