Al-Jazeera journalists walk free in Egypt after Sisi pardon

EGYPT: Two Al-Jazeera journalists walked free after being pardoned Wednesday along with scores of others by Egypt's president, following criticism of his government for jailing opponents.
The release of Canadian Mohamed Fahmy and colleague Baher Mohamed was welcomed by their supporters, with Al-Jazeera saying it was "delighted" and Fahmy's lawyer Amal Clooney calling it "a historic day".
The 100 prisoners pardoned by President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi included women activists Sana Seif and Yara Sallam, the president's office said, in a goodwill gesture on the eve of a major Muslim holiday.
The move came a day before Sisi is due to head to New York to deliver a speech at the UN General Assembly. Within hours of the announcement, Fahmy and Mohamed were dropped off by authorities in the upmarket Cairo suburb of Maadi in their blue prison uniforms.
They told an AFP correspondent on the spot that they were looking forward to being reunited with their families.
"I'm feeling ecstatic knowing that I don't have to worry about lawyers, police officers following me all over the place and knowing that I'm going to share my apartment tonight with my beloved wife," said Fahmy.
"Now we're free, me and (my wife) Marwa are going to celebrate. We're going to go back to Canada and travel and... get on with our lives."
Mohamed said: "We're very, very happy. But we're a bit surprised about how it was done.
"I can live a normal life with my family, with my children. The whole nightmare is over finally. Thank God." - AFP
