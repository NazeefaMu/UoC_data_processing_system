The Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) said today they would have a discussion with President Maithripala Sirisena on December 18 with regard to the issues concerning the 2016 budget proposals.
GMOA Spokesman Dr. Navin de Soysa said they had not been invited to the discussion with Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe today.
The GMOA earlier said a decision would be taken at tomorrow's Central Committee meeting with regard to their future course of action.
The doctors launched a countrywide strike last week against certain proposals of the 2016 budget.
