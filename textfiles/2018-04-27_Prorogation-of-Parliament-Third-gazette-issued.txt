President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday issued the third gazette over the prorogation of Parliament. The latest extraordinary gazette amended the venue of the next parliamentary session from 'Parliament Hall' to the 'Chamber of Parliament'.

The previous gazette was issued by the President with the powers vested in him by ‘Article 70 (4)’ of the Constitution. However, it was amended to ‘Article 70’ in the new gazette.  

The second gazette said "KNOW YE that by virtue of the powers vested in me by Article 70 (4) of the Chapter XI of the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, I Maithripala Sirisena, President do by this Proclamation summon Parliament to meet at the Parliament Hall, Sri Jayewardenepura, on the Eighth day of May, Two Thousand and Eighteen at 02.15 p.m."

The third gazette was changed to read "KNOW YE that by virtue of the powers vested in me by Article 70 of the Chapter XI of the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, I Maithripala Sirisena, President do by this Proclamation summon Parliament to meet at the Chamber of the Parliament, Sri Jayewardenepura, on the Eighth day of May, Two Thousand and Eighteen at 02.15 p.m."
