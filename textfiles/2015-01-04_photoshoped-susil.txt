The government keeps former LTTE arms procurer Kumaran Pathmanathan alias KP in safe custody to use him at the right time at the right place to counter UNHRC allegations and fight international propaganda against Sri Lanka in Geneva and elsewhere, General Secretary of the UPFA, Environment and Renewable Energy Minister Susil Premajayantha said.
Minister Premajayantha said the opposition had stooped to the lowest level of misinformation and disinformation as a picture of President Rajapaksa has been distorted to give a wrong impression to the public.
“In the genuine picture taken during a birth day party of Sri Lanka’s doyen of cinema, Dr. Lester James Peiris shows that President gives a hug to Dr. Peiris to congratulate him. But in this altered picture shown by the opposition, the head of KP has been super imposed to the head of Dr. Peiris to give a wrong impression that President hugs and greets KP, which is highly offensive,” Minister Premajayantha said.Video by Sanath DesmondPix by Kushan Pathiraja
