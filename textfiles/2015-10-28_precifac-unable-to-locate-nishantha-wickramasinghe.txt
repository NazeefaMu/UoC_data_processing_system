The Presidential Commission of Inquiry to Investigate and Inquire into Serious Acts of Fraud, Corruption and Abuse of Power, State Resources and Privileges (PRECIFAC) said today it was unable to hand over the notice summoning former SriLankan airlines chairman Nishantha Wickramasinghe because he was not at his residence in Mount Lavinia.
The senior PRECIFAC official said when its officers visited Mr. Wickramasinhe’s residence in Mount Lavinia his wife had told them he had not come home for three years and that she was unaware of his whereabouts.
He was expected to report to PRECIFAC at 9.00 a.m. on Friday in connection with a complaint regarding irregularities in the SriLankan airlines catering service.
Former Civil Aviation Minister Priyankara Jayaratne was also asked to report to PRECIFAC on Friday but his statement was recorded today because he was unable to make it on Friday. (Ajith Siriwardana)
