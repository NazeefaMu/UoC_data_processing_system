The Neonatal Transport Project carried out by Dr. Ramya de Silva, Senior Consultant Paediatrician at the Lady Ridgeway  Hospital for Children, Colombo won the prestigious British Medical Journal (BMJ) South Asia Award for 2017 in the category of ‘Healthcare Innovation of the Year.’    


Dr. Ramya de Silva received the award from Chief Guest Shri Ashwini Kumar Choubey, the Indian State Minister of Health and Family Welfare, at a ceremony held at Hotel Shangri la, New Delhi, on November 18. 


Dr. Fiona Godlee, Editor in Chief of the BMJ said, “This fourth edition of the BMJ awards has become bigger than previous editions with 2015 nominations from across the region. We had the hard task of shortlisting 30 finalists and eventually selecting 13 winners in different categories. The work done by all of them are of the highest standards and innovative in approach, that eventually makes a positive impact on the lives of so many people.”  The Neonatal Transport Project initiated by Dr. de Silva has now become a national programme. Sri Lanka is the first country in South Asia to have a neonatal transport service at national level. The Health Ministry has incorporated the neonatal transport service as a way forward to reduce neonatal deaths that contribute to 75.1% of deaths that occur under the age of five. 


Recently, Dr. Ramya de Silva was elected an Honourary Fellow of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, UK in recognition of her outstanding contribution to children. She was the President of the Sri Lanka College of Paediatricians (2015/2016), President of the Prenatal Society of Sri Lanka (2012/2013) and the Founder President of the Neonatal Transport Forum of Sri Lanka.
