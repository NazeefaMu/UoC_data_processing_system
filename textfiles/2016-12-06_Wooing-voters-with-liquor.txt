Wooing voters with liquor!


	



 

A local politico in the deep South representing a main political party was recently appointed as the chief organizer of a constituency which had long been a stronghold of a prominent political family. This politico now thick in the party’s propaganda activities in the area is reportedly throwing parties for supporters where hard liquor flows like water.

 


The irony is that this local politico is liberally serving liquor to woo new votes and entertain supporters when his party leader is engaged in a crusade against liquor and narcotics. 


The politico would usually place an order for several dozens of bottles well in advance to entertain those expected to participate in the party propaganda programmes organized by him, they say.
