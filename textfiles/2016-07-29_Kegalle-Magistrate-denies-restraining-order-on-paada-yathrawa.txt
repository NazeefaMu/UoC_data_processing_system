Kegalle Magistrate denies restraining order on paada yathrawa


	

Kegalle Magistrate Gayan Meegahage yesterday refused to grant the restraining order requested by the police seeking to prevent the paada yathrawa organised by the Joint Opposition from entering the Kegalle city limits from Karandupana.

HQI Kegalle Police had filled the petition on behalf of the police and cited several reasons why the procession should not pass through the city.

The HQI had stated that the president was scheduled to travel through Kegalle on July 29 and the march could create a public disturbance.

Police further stated that the UNP had planned to hold a propaganda campaign in Galigamuwa on the same day and that a clash could possibly occur between the two groups.

The magistrate asked the police whether the paada yathrawa had caused any disturbance to the public so far and whether a clash had occurred during the march so far. The police informed Court there had been no such incidents.

Subsequently, the magistrate had denied the request and given approval for the use of one lane for the paada yathrawa.

However, the magistrate had told the police to stop the protest march if there was a disturbance or clash and to inform the Court immediately if such should occur. (Rohan Kumara)
