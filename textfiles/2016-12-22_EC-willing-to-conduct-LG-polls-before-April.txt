Elections Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya said yesterday his office was willing to conduct the local authorities’ election before April 10 as otherwise it would be difficult for candidates to be in the fray during the festive season.

Mr. Desapriya remarked this in the wake of President Maithripala Sirisena informing his party men that he would take necessary steps to conduct the election.

The election chief said he would need at least 90 days to conclude the process of election once the electoral wards were gazetted.

“We would like to conclude the whole process before April 10. Otherwise, it will be difficult for candidates to be involved in their activities during the festive season,” he said. (Kelum Bandara)
