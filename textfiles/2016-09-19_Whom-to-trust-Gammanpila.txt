Top government leaders had different opinions on the unitary character of the country and the prominence given to Buddhism which had resulted in utter confusion, Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) General Secretary MP Udaya Gammanpila said today.

He said the President and the Prime Minister had assured to leave the prominence given to Buddhism and the unitary character of the country as it is but former President Chandrika Kumaratunga had expressed contradicting sentiments.

“Mrs. Kumaratunga is the in-charge of reconciliation. She recently said she wanted to create a federal yet a semi-secular State in Sri Lanka. This contradicts what the President or the Premier had stated. We don’t know whom to trust anymore,” he told a news conference. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
