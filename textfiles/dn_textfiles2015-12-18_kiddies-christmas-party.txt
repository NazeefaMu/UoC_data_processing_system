Kiddies Christmas Party

On December 6, the Water's Edge held it's third annual “Kiddies Christmas Party” at the Grand Lawn. Santa himself made a grand appearance on a sea plane while his merry little elves arrived on a boat. The traditional lighting of the Water’s Edge Christmas tree also took place later that evening.
“The Water’s Edge Kiddies Christmas Party is the highlight of the season for us at the hotel. Every department gets so deeply involved in making this day extra special for all the little ones who come in wide-eyed wonder to see what special offerings we have for them every year. Our chefs go all out to make mouth-watering treats, while the décor and event teams put their creative caps on to make magic. We are very excited to see the reactions of the children this year when they walk in to the Winter Wonderland”, Water’s Edge Director Sales and Marketing Thilanka Muthukumarana noted.
Special appearances by cartoon characters and superheroes such as Dora, Batman, Ironman and Thor were the highlight of the evening. A scrumptious buffet overflowing with traditional Christmas favourites was on display as a compliment to the culinary prowess of the Water’s Edge chefs.
