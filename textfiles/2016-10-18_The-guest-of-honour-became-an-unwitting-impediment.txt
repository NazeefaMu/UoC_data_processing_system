The guest of honour became an unwitting impediment


	



 

An unusual incident where the guest of honour had to walk out to enable starting a stalled session of a workshop held exclusively for a select group of women participants, has been reported from a gem-rich area in the country. 

 


The guest of honour, a young handsome deputy purohita had tea with the participants following the inaugural session. About 100 fair participants present were in a jovial mood and the young purohita soon became the centre of their attraction.  One of them took a selfie or two with the young politico and that set the ball rolling. All participants were soon seen falling over one another in an endless bid to take selfies with the politico. 


The time set apart for the tea recess had ticked away and the young deputy purohita, now a virtual prisoner of the participants was still posing for the selfies being taken by them.


Several requests made to the women to go back to their seats for the second session fell on deaf ears. Realizing that the selfie-mad participants would not let go of the young politico so long as he was present, the organizers made a kind request to the latter to walk out of the hall for a while.  
The participants rushed back to their seats as their guest of honour walked out, they say.
