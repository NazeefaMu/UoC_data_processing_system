The Betel leaf party leadership summoned all Western Province local politicos seeking party candidacy at the upcoming PC polls for a powwow recently. Eighteen sitting PC members and several Blue party front-liners had attended this meeting, they say.

 


Giving a pep talk to the prospective candidates, the Betel leaf secretary had asked them to get busy with attending to the pressing needs of their respective areas assuring them that funds necessary would be made available to them. 


However, the participants had pointed out that no amount of work for the people would bring votes unless they entered the ‘battle’ with the ‘correct leaders’.  Some of them had posed the direct question: “Who are going to be our allies at the upcoming polls?”


After some hesitation, the Betel leaf secretary had replied: “Who else could be our election ally if not the Green party?”


“What about the JO?” most participants had asked in unison.The secretary had only smiled.
