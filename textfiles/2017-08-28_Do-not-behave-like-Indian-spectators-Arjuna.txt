World Cup-winning cricket captain and Minister Arjuna Ranatunga today requested Sri Lankan Cricket lovers to stop behaving like Indian spectators at the end of cricket matches.

Addressing the media at the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation Head Office yesterday he said an incident had been reported as spectators had thrown plastic bottles into the ground during the third one day international cricket match between Sri Lanka and India at the Pallekele International Cricket Stadium in Pallekele on Sunday.

“Such incidents should not be repeated. Sri Lankans love cricket and they feel sad when we lose a match. We have made lots of sacrifices for cricket and those sacrifices had been made while loosing lots of things. Every cricketer in out team are mentally depressed,” he said.

Therefore, I request our cricket lovers not to behave like Indian spectators. We have a very good history and culture. Such misbehaviour is not accepted in our culture and history,” Mr. Ranatunga said.

"Several cricketers had been summoned before the Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID) and I informed about it to President Maithripala Sirisena who promised to look into the matter", he said.

The outspoken Minister also said an interim committee has to be appointed to probe frauds and irregularities at Sri Lanka Cricket, alleging that cricket was now being virtually run by gamblers who have put cricket at stake. (Chaturanga Pradeep)
