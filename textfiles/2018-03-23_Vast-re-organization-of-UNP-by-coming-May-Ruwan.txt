Vast re-organization of UNP by coming May–Ruwan


	

The country would be able to witness a large-scale re-organization of the United National Party (UNP) before May this year, State Minister of Defense Ruwan Wijewardene said yesterday.

Mr. Wijewardene made this comment at a ceremony held to mark the 66th death anniversary of the late Prime Minister D S Senanayake in Colombo last evening.

“The committee appointed to look into the reorganization of the party had recommended that a large-scale reorganization process was needed and Party Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe has given his blessing for this process to take place as soon as possible. Therefore, it was decided that these changes should take place by May this year,” Mr. Wijewardene said.

He said the committee had recommended that the re-organization process begins from the grass-root level and the younger members of the party should be given this task. This he said is recommended in addition to the reshuffling of office bearers of the party.

Referring to the no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Wickremesinghe, Mr. Wijewardene said he was confident that it will not be successful. “The joint opposition boasts that they have the support of 21 UNP MPs but they will not get even two UNPers supporting their cause,” he said while highlighting the fact that the UNP Parliamentary group and other MPs who represent the United National Front (UNF) had pledged their fullest support to Mr. Wickremesinghe.

He said the JVP and the TNA would also think of the country when deciding on whether to support the motion. (Yohan Perera)
