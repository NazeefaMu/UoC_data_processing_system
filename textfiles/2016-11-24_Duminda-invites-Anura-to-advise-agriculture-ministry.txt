Agriculture Minister Duminda Dissanayake yesterday invited Chief Opposition Whip and Janatha Vimukthi  Peramuna (JVP) Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake to play an active role in developing the agricultural sector by becoming an advisor to his ministry.

“You spoke about reviving the agricultural sector, but you too failed in this endeavour during your tenure as the agriculture minister. However why don't you support us by accepting the post of advisor to my ministry," the minister asked the JVP leader.

Mr. Dissanayake response was not audible because his mike was not switched on at that time.

However, President Maithripala Sirisena who was in the chambers was seen to be smiling at whatever was said.

The JVP leader accused the agricultural unit at the President's office getting involved in the agricultural sector bypassing the agriculture ministry. The President walked into the chambers at the time Mr. Dissanayake was making the allegation but there was no response from the president. (Yohan Perera)
