Law Commission to propose measures for updating country’s laws

The Law Commission is planning to make several recommendations to the government on measures to update and modernize the country’s laws and regulations which are considered outdated.
A spokesman for the Commission said the recommendations would help simplify the laws of the land for the benefit of the people. Among the recommendations would be amendments to simplify the procedure of filing cases to the Supreme Court and measures to prevent damages caused to the privacy of individuals through Face Book and other social media.
The recommendations also dealt with clearing the interpretations of partition case decisions which inconvenienced official residents in vihara and devalaya lands and resolving problems relating to deeds of gift. These recommendations will be handed over to Justice Minister Wijayadasa Rajapaksha by Law Commission Chairman Romesh de Silva PC, the spokesman added.
