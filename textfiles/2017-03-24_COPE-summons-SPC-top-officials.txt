The Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) in Parliament has summoned top officials of the State Pharmaceuticals Corporation (SPC) over the alleged financial fraud said to have taken place when importing a cancer vaccine.

A member of the committee who wished to remain anonymous said the SPC officials were summoned before COPE on April 6 over their alleged involvement in importing the vaccine ‘Taxacad’ locally known as ‘Hearticad’.

Speaking to Daily Mirror, Chairman of the SPC Mr. Sarath Liyanage confirmed that COPE had summoned them. However, he said it was only to question them regarding the 2014 SPC Annual report. He said it was not unusual, as COPE had the right to do so and that it was only a normal check on another Corporation.

Recently the joint opposition revealed that malpractices had taken place when importing ‘Hearticad’- a breast cancer vaccine, and accused Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne and top officials of the SPC of being involved in the racket.

The JO had lodged a complaint with the Bribery Commission on March 01 stating that the Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne committed a crime by importing Rs.1, 500 million worth of vaccines which were detrimental to the health of cancer patients and putting their lives at risk.
