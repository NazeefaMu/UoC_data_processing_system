Don Ladylike Dresses to Meet Pope Francis

What do you wear to meet the Pope? If you’re one of the Obama ladies, ladylike perfection, of course!
Clad in pastel hued and A-line silhouettes, Michelle Obama and her daughters, Malia and Sasha, stood on the tarmac when Pope Francis landed in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday September 22, for the first stop on his US tour.
Always one to gravitate towards color (and wear it beautifully), the FLOTUS, 51, modeled a mint-hued Carolina Herrera cowl-neck dress, cinched at the waist with a matching skinny belt. Pointed-toe heels in a metallic hue completed her ensemble.
And her little ladies looked no less chic! Malia, 17, who recently completed an internship on the set of HBO’s Girls, worked a black and white dress with a floral skirt, teamed with sky-blue Mary Janes.
Her younger sister, Sasha, 14, chose a black top with pleated cap sleeves, paired with a color-blocked Kate Spade skirt and ballerina flats. Of course, the Obama ladies were joined by the president, Barack Obama, who looked dapper in a navy-blue suit, a white button-up, a cornflower-blue tie, and lace-up shoes. The next day, the President and the First Lady joined Pope Francis on the balcony of the White House, during an arrival ceremony honoring the Pope. For that occasion, Michelle slipped into a navy Monique Lhuillier dress with a floral lace bodice.
Saluting the Pope’s commitment to environmental preservation, President Obama said at the ceremony, “Holy Father, you remind us that we have a sacred obligation to protect our planet—God’s magnificent gift to us. We support your call to all world leaders to support the communities most vulnerable to a changing climate and to come together to preserve our precious world for future generations.” Washington, D.C. is just the first stop on Pope Francis’ tour of the US. His Holiness will also visit NYC from Thursday to Saturday, at which time he’ll meet with the UN, lead a procession through Central Park, and hold a mass at Madison Square Garden.
He’ll then depart for Philadelphia, where he’ll see Independence Mall and hold a prayer vigil during the Festival of Families, to name just a few of the activities on his busy schedule.
