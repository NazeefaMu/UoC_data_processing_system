No more wining and dining to win hearts and minds


	



The Green leader gave a severe warning to a onetime high flier from a city-based stronghold the other day, they say.


This worthy now shorn of his wings had incurred the wrath of the party boss for having made it a practice to wine and dine a select group of backbenchers at high-end hotels from time to time. 
The party boss reprimanded the man on a previous occasion too for taking the advantage of his brief absence from the island to conduct a workshop for the young Diyawanna backbenchers. The Green leader had decided that enough was enough when he realized that the man now down and out was working on a personal agenda, prejudicial to party interests.
