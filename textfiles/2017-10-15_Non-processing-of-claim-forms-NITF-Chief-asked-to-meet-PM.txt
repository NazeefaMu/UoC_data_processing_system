Non-processing of claim forms: NITF Chief asked to meet PM


	

National Insurance Trust Fund Chairman Manjula De Silva has been summoned for a meeting with Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe tomorrow over the non-processing of compensatory claims submitted by owners of business establishments and householders who were affected by the floods in May this year.

This was revealed by Chief of Staff of the Prime Minister's office Minister Sagala Ratnayake during a UNP Bala Mandala meeting at Morawaka on Saturday evening.

None of the applications received from the entrepreneurs and individuals are said to have been processed by the National insurance trust fund to date.

A National insurance Trust Fund official said there is confusion with regard to the applications received because of instances where flood victims had claimed compensation for the loss of businesses and damaged houses in one application. (Yohan Perera)
