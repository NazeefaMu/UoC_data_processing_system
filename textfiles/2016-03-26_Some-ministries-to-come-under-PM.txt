Some ministries to come under PM


	

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has decided to bring under his supervision several ministries, which were subjected to bureaucracy during the Rakapaksa regime, that have not been able to achieve the targets set for the first two quarters.

This decision has been taken as some ministries which were exposed to rigid bureaucracy during the last regime had not yet been converted to suit the good governance concept of the United National Front Government.

Some activities of the Foreign Affairs Ministry were taken over during the 100 day programme and certain activities of the Education ministry have already been taken over. (Anjula Mahika Weerarathna)
