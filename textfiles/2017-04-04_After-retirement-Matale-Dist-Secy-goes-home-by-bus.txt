Mr. Kumarasiri was a senior officer in the Public Administration service had served in Anuradhapura and Nuwaraeliya districts before being appointed as the District Secretary for Matale.

During the send-off party, he said , "I am happy because I was able to send the resignation papers to the secretary of the Ministry of Home affairs 5 months prior to my retirement at a time when government officers tend to seek extensions of service before retirement. I got used to working intimately with the staff rather than giving orders. I did not criticize government policies and acted to implement them. I request all other officers to discharge their duties with commitment without committing mistakes” (M.W.Somaratna)
