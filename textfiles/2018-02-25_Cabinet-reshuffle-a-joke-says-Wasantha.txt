Cabinet reshuffle was a joke and the Government had failed to deliver the change expected by the people, State Minister of Foreign Affairs Wasantha Senanayake said today.

He made the remark outside the Presidential Secretariat soon after the new Cabinet Ministers sworn in.

He told journalists that the first part of the comedy produced by the Government was played today and the second part would be played next.

“I don’t know how people will react as to whether they laugh, cry or pelt stones,” he said.

He said he was not disappointed of the action but he thought that the Government had failed to deliver the change expected by the people.

He added that people would not be deceived by such jokes and the changes expected by the people should be done. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
