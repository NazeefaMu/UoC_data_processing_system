The Railway Employees’ Trade Union Federation (RETUF) today decided to call off today's proposed 24-hour token strike after an assurance given by President Maithripala Sirisena, the Transport Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva and the Deputy Minister Ashok Abeysinghe over their four demands, RETUF Convener Janaka Fernando said.

During the discussions the president had assured not to grant any Railway Department land to the private sector and to the proposal land bank, prevent irregular recruitment, not to abolish pensions rights and stop the proposed Railway Development Council.

Minister Nimal Siripala da Silva said he had never tried to issue a cabinet paper to change the Railway Department to an Authority and to grant any Railway Department land to private sectors.

According to the Railways Act, those decisions could be taken by the Railway General Manager, the Minister said.

Representatives of the Locomotive operating engineers' association, the Sri Lanka Independent Employees Association, Railway Technical Officers Association, Sri Lanka Independent Railway Employees union, All-island United Railway Services Association, Ratmalana Railway Workers Union and six other railway unions participated in the meeting.
