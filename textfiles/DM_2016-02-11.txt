Discussion to amend Bhikku Kathikawath Bill
	
The Chief Adikarana Sangha Nayake of Colombo Nava Korale Ven. Diviyagaha Yasassi Thera said today several proposals were put forward to amend the Bhikku Kathikawath Bill at a meeting held at the All Ceylon Buddhist Congress yesterday morning with the participation of the Maha Nayake theras including Ven. Pahamune Sumangala Thera, Ven. Akuretiye Nanda Thera, Ven. Thrikunamale Ananda Thera and representatives of the Buddhist Affairs Ministry.
Ven. Yasassi Thera said they discussed about the Theravada Bhikku Kathikawath Bill which was presented to parliament and that they completely agreed with the Supreme Court ruling on certain clauses of the Bill.
We totally agree with the Supreme Court ruling. We suspect that certain amendments to the Bill have been made to create issues among the Bhikkus. The Bhikku Kathikawatha we drafted earlier, did not include those amendments that the Supreme Court gave a ruling on. If the original Bill we created was presented, there would not have been any issue and everyone would have approved it without any doubt, the Thera said.
He said that the Bhikkus requested this Bill to be brought in for the past fifty years and that it was the responsibility of the government to enact this Bill after the necessary amendments were made at the committee stage in parliament without getting it delayed any further.(Ajith Siriwardana)

Investigate, not promote, ex-Army Chief: HRW
	
The Sri Lankan governments appointment to parliament of the former army chief whose forces were implicated in widespread abuses contradicts pledges to investigate alleged war crimes, Human Rights Watch (HRW) said in a statement.
Fonsekas appointment signals that the government may protect senior military leaders suspected of widespread abuses, said Brad Adams, Asia director.
The government should meaningfully demonstrate to the Sri Lankan people and the UN that its serious about accountability and not on the road to a whitewash. Fonsekas appointment is a breach of trust for victims and families who believed in this governments commitment to deliver justice for war crimes, Adams said.
Fonsekas appointment was announced the day that President Sirisena met with the UN high commissioner for human rights, Zeid Raad Al Hussein, and renewed his commitment to justice and accountability for wartime abuses, the statement said.
Under UN Human Rights Council Resolution 30/1, adopted on October 1, 2015, Sri Lanka agreed to establish various mechanisms with the assistance of the international community to deliver justice, reconciliation, and respect for human rights. Sirisena has recently elicited concerns about his commitment to justice by saying that it would not be possible to include foreign judges and prosecutors in a justice mechanism, a key component of the resolution, Adams said.
President Sirisena and Prime Minister Wickramasinghe are sending worrying signals on accountability at a time when they should be presenting themselves as leaders determined to achieve justice for all Sri Lankans, Adams said.
By giving Fonseka a seat in parliament and the highest military rank, they threaten the goodwill their government has generated since coming to power, he said.

No change on Laila and Suruku fishing net ban: Minister
	
Fisheries Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said in no uncertain terms that the decision taken by the ministry to ban the use of Laila and Suruku nets would be implemented from February 21.
At a discussion with two fishing communities at the ministry, the minister said today anyone using the banned Laila and Suruku nets for fishing after February 21 would be arrested and the equipment and the boats confiscated.
The fishing communities in the country should comply with the conditions in the line with the circular on fishing. The ministry decision will not change. We have instructed the Navy, the Coast Guard and the Police to arrest those carrying out illegal fishing and to take necessary action against them, he said.
The two fishing communities had reportedly engaged in a heated argument on the contents of the circular.
The local fishermen said most of their problems had arisen because of the poaching by Indian fishermen. In response the minister said Indian fishermen poaching in Sri Lankan waters would be arrested and their boats, the catch and fishing equipment would be confiscated. He said this matter was discussed with the Indian Foreign Affairs Minister during her recent visit to Sri Lanka.
Currently some 20 Indian fishermen are in Sri Lankan custody.
Last year the Navy and the Coast Guard had taken into custody explosives such as 159kg of water gel, 26Kg of TNT, 5Kg of Gelignite, 5.74Kg of C4, 33 meters of safety fuse, 358 detonators, 157 illegal fishing nets, 121 boats, 120 boat engines, 3092Kg of sea cucumber, 13048Kg of conch shell, 5000Kg of endangered fish species and 380 fishermen who had engaged in illegal fishing.
The minister warned the two fishing communities not to take the law into their hands and inform the Navy or the coast guard if any illegal fishing was taking place. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

Resist govt. decision to implement the UNHRC resolution: MR
	
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa today called upon Sri Lankans to unite and resist the governments decision to implement the UNHRC resolution on Sri Lanka.
Issuing a statement, the present Kurunegala District parliamentarian said the war was won by an SLFP government led by him and that it was a matter of profound regret the SLFP has been subordinated to the UNP which tried to sabotage the war effort at every turn.
When the UNPs attempts to stop the war by defeating the government at the budget vote in 2007 did not work, they ridiculed the war effort by saying that any ox can fight a war and while claiming to be advancing on Alimankada the army was actually moving towards Pamankada. It is not surprising to see such people now trying to exact revenge from those who won the war, he said in the statement.
He said the UNP led government accepted the Geneva resolution with the same carelessness with which they entered into the ceasefire agreement with the LTTE in 2002.
Im profoundly saddened to see that the SLFP has also joined the UNP in this great betrayal. The UNP may be deriving a great deal of satisfaction by thus getting a section of the SLFP which won the war to underwrite every traitorous they commit, he said.
He alleged the government has accepted the Office of the High Commissioner on Human Rights (OHCHR) report which said that war crimes had been committed by Sri Lankan armed forces and they have agreed to set up a war crimes tribunal manned by foreign judges to try war heroes for these alleged crimes.
The OHCHR is already under heavy criticism by the UN Human Rights Council itself. The UNHRC passes every year a resolution calling upon the OHCHR to end the domination of that office by Westerners and to reduce its dependency on their funds. The government has thus agreed to place Sri Lanka under the supervision of an institution that is facing criticism by the UNHRC itself for its Western bias, he said.
