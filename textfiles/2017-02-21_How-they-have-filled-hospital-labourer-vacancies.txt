Two powerful upcountry politicos at provincial level had distributed most hospital labourer appointments in the province to their political supporters.

 


Having done away with the proper recruitment procedure, these two political heavyweights had distributed 75 appointments each among their political supporters. Meanwhile, they had conceded a quota of two appointments each to the council members in a bid to prevent them from raising a hue and cry in protest.


A leading upcountry politician who condemned the manner in which the hospital labourer vacancies were filled said: “This is a typical instance where those wielding the ladle generously serving themselves as the popular Sinhala proverb goes.”
