They planned to restore the game to its pristine glory


	



 

They had met to ascertain the cause for the fate that has befallen our popular game which once brought much prestige to the country. 

 


The group included a very high authority and several top team members in yahapalanaya.


Most in the group nodded agreement to views expressed by Captain Cool. Many characters directly involved in the game came in for flak. The purohita currently handling Sports was not spared either.
Plans designed by the board high-ups to send rolling the heads of the players who refused to participate in the Pakistan tour too came in for critical comment. Match fixing charges against some prominent figures also figured at this discussion. 


The majority of participants endorsed the suggestion that an interim committee was the immediate need of the hour and they were firm in the decision that none of the guys responsible for destroying the game should be brought back into the scene. 


However, the group dispersed without deciding on a timeframe for implementing their decisions, they say.
