Private bus owners will launch an island wide strike protesting against the government’s decision to impose a minimum penalty of Rs. 2,500 for traffic offences, which was proposed in the 2017 budget.  

Chairman of the Lanka Private Bus Owners’ Association (LPBOA) Chairman Gemunu Wijeratne today said the Union had not changed it stance on the matter. The move will lock horns with the government, which has made it clear that its decision will not be changed.

Wijeratne also said the Union had scheduled a meeting with Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake this evening. (Chaturanga Pradeep)
