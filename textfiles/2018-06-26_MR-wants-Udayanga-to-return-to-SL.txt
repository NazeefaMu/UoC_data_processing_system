Former Sri Lankan Ambassador to Russia Udayanga Weeratunga, who is under a court warrant in a case pertaining to the purchase of MiG fighter jets, has been asked to return to the country by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, the 'Yahapalana Vindithayo Sanvidanaya' organisation said yesterday.

A spokesman for the organisation called "Victims of Yahapalana Government" said that he would request for the removal of Weeratunga's travel ban through a motion from the Fort Magistrate's Court today.

This organization said further that due to the travel ban, it was an obstacle for him to return to Sri Lanka and that he would present a motion to get this ban removed accordingly.(Nalaka Sanjeewa Dahanayaaka)
