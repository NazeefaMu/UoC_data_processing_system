Luxury Resortwear is the new growth category and is showing increased activities in the global resortwear segment.  In Sri Lanka where Summer and resortwear are the prime seasons, this new trend will be the focus of the Fashion Week showcasing Resortwear, Swimwear, and glamorous beachwear at the Shangri La Hotel, Colombo. This expanded scope will be showcased through emerging, established and international designers. The format of international fashion week will be presented in the first week of July.

The Luxury Resortwear segment is driven by occasions, which are based on events like destination weddings and frequent resort holidays, and design discerned tropical living. The Swim and Resort Edition of the Fashion Week in Colombo, which is spearheading a platform for resort wear in the region, further creates opportunities for designers in Sri Lanka and in the region through these renewed activities. This segment is also strategic to Sri Lanka as it positions Sri Lanka as a destination on a high profile lifestyle basis.

Luxury resort-wear is a new growth category, which includes Swimwear and Resort-wear. With every passing year, this week of fashion that focuses on Resortwear and SwimWear strives to set a higher standard for Sri Lanka and to position Sri Lanka as a destination for luxury resort-wear.
