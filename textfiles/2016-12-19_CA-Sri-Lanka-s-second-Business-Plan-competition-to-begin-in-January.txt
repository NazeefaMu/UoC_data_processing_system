“Preparing a Business Plan is an important part for a Chartered Accountant. Therefore it’s quiet relevant that CA Sri Lanka leading in doing the Business Plan competition in Sri Lanka.

We learnt that there are 6,200 Sri Lankan students in Australia at the moment and 85 percent are in Melbourne. We needed to take more students to Sydney and Brisbane. Then Andrew expressed his willingness to have a team participating  in the Business Plan  competition from Sri Lanka, then I was thinking at CA Sri Lanka and we had endless discussions,” he said.
