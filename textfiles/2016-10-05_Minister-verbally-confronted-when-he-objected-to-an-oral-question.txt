A heated argument was witnessed in Parliament yesterday when a government minister was verbally confronted by the government ally United National Party ( UNP), Joint Opposition and the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna ( JVP) after he objected to an oral question.

The Minister, Faizer Mustapha who objected to an oral question raised by UNP MP Chaminda Wijesiri on an alleged act of fraud by Uva Chief Minister.

“There have been no fraud reported. The member should settle his personal matters with the chief minister without raising questions to insult him" Mr Mustapha said.

Minister Kabir Hashim who raised an objection said the minister has no right to raise objections about an oral question. “The Minister is bound by the standing orders to answer oral questions and therefore he has no right to object" he said.

Leader of the Joint Opposition group Dinesh Gunawardane said the Minister should not violate the right of MPs to raise oral questions

MP Wimal Weerawansa said the Minister is acting in this manner as he is appearing for the Chief Minister in a Court case.

Mr. Mushpaha who shot back said he is not involved in any incident concerning the Chief Minister though he is appearing for the case.

Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake said the question was about a robbery. "When you raise a question about a robbery it is obvious that you have to call the person you are accusing a rogue," he said alleging that the Minister is trying to cover-up the charges against the Chief Minister.  (Yohan Perera)
