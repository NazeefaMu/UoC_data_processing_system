New taboos slapped on them irk the employees


	



 

Employees of a certain independent commission are highly disconsolate over a series of taboos imposed on them by the administration.

 


The use of the mobile phone inside the office is taboo, they say. They are required to obtain the permission of the head of the administration even to use a land phone.


Employees are also required to give a one week’s notice if they intend going on leave. This stipulation prevents them from obtaining leave for an emergency like the illness of a family member, they say.


Given these taboos, the disgusted employees have begun looking for employment opportunities elsewhere. It is an irony that an institution meant to provide redress to those who suffer injustice has turned a blind eye to injustice being meted out to a section of its own staff, an employee said.
