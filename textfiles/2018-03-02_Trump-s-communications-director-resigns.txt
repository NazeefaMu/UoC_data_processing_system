Washington, (Hindustan Times), Mar 01, 2018 -  Hope Hicks, US President Donald Trump’s communications director and one of his longest-serving associates, on Wednesday announced she was resigning, adding to the long line of senior aides who have exited the White House in just over 13 months of its term.   


Hicks cited no reasons for leaving, but the timing did raise questions, as her resignation came just a day after she told a congressional panel investigating Russian meddling in 2016 US polls, that she has had to tell “white lies” while serving the President.
