This is a government-owned undertaking that can be run at a profit, but like other government-owned enterprises it is eternally in the red due to the twin commonplace evil – corruption and mismanagement – an inevitable outcome of political interference. 
Meanwhile, a loud cry is heard from the Sapugaskanda area that a move is afoot to purchase two de luxe limousines each for the Ministerial one and the fair Deputy in charge of this undertaking. What has ruffled the employees of this undertaking is the enormity of the extravagant taste of the Ministerial duo who have already got several luxury cars and jeeps at their disposal!
The directorate of this statutory body eager to please their new political bosses has approved the purchase in double quick time, they say.
