Deputy Minister Palitha Thewarapperuma today tendered his resignation as Bulathsinhala Organiser of the United National Party (UNP), to Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.

In his resignation letter, the Deputy Minister stated the failure to obtain the votes in Bulathsinhala Pradeshiya Sabha at the recent Local Government (LG) Elections and the failure to get a good Police OIC to Bulathsinhala Police Station were among the main reasons behind his resignation.

Speaking to the Daily Mirror the Deputy Minister explained that though he fulfilled the duties as the Bulathsinhala Organiser he never accepted the appointment letter.

He said the Bulathsinhala seat consisted of majority Tamil population, therefore, request the Prime Minister to appoint a responsible person as the UNP organizer.

In his letter, he had also informed the Premier to take his Deputy Minister portfolio if his resignation as the UNP organiser was not enough. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
