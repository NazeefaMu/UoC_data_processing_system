A prominent minister holding a key portfolio has of late become a regular visitor to the official residence of a very high political authority, they say. 

 

The minister facing several allegations has incurred the displeasure of his party colleagues too. The minister these days whiles away much of his time gossiping and cracking jokes with the family members of the high political authority. Meanwhile, some political sources say that the politico is harbouring the fear of losing his portfolio and he is trying to be in the good books of the family members of the high authority as a ploy to head off the looming political misfortune.
