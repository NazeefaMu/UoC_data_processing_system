President Lajcák cited the work of Mrs. Vishaka Dharmadasa, as an example of how an individual can contribute to a country’s peace building initiatives.

He also cited an example of how Sri Lanka’s civil society made a contribution to the GoSL efforts on drafting a reconciliation and peace building programme for the country.

Speaking at the High Level Meeting, Sri Lanka’s Permanent Representative to the United Nations in New York Ambassador Rohan Perera highlighted the initiatives undertaken by the Sri Lankan Government on reconciliation and peace building.

Ambassador Perera emphasized the importance of prevention of conflicts, as reflected in the Secretary General’s Report on Peace Building and Sustaining Peace, as a factor that would save countless lives and resources that could otherwise be utilized for a country’s development.

He also stressed the importance of ensuring predictable and sustained funding for peace building initiatives through the Peace Building Fund, which were crucial for reconciliation and peace building efforts of countries such as Sri Lanka.

Dr. Perera highlighted the collaboration between Sri Lanka and the Peace Building Support Office, as an example of a fruitful partnership on peace building between a Member State and the United Nations.
