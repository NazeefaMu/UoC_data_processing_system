The Big Boss gave a senior Betel leaf purohita a tongue-lashing the other day, they say.

 


A complaint that the purohita, a former secretarial one representing an electorate close to the city failed to pull his weight behind the party’s campaign had led to his being pulled up by the Boss.


The Big Boss had also accused the purohita of playing a double game.


The purohita is said to have made a hasty retreat making no reply to the charges made against him.
