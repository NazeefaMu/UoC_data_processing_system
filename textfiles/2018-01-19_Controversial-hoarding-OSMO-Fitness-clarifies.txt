In response to the incident regarding the controversial hoarding, OSMO Fitness in its official Facebook page said it was the first line in a scheduled awareness campaign, which promoted an ‘Obesity-Free Sri Lanka’.

It said the promotion which will be launch next week was driven by some disturbing figures in a recent World Health Organization report that states an alarming percentage of women in Sri Lanka are more prone to diabetes, overweight, obesity and physical inactivity when compared to males.

“We like to reiterate that we do not have any intention whatsoever to degrade, offend, insult or undermine any person or women in general and that our moral obligation is towards improving the overall health of all Sri Lankans which we take very seriously.

“We would also like to remind everyone that OSMO is a fitness center that caters to many female members, along with several qualified female instructors who strive to help women achieve a healthy, fit and disease-free lifestyle. Women have always been an integral part of OSMO and will continue to do so well into the future.

“We respect the different viewpoints of the general public and regret any offence that was generated in response to the subject advertisement. Hence, we have decided to withdraw all communications relating to the advertisement in question.

“We would also like to voice our appreciation for each and every comment made in this regard, both on social media and various other levels, and are thankful to everyone who voiced their concerns and let us know their thoughts and insights on this sensitive topic,” it said.

Further, OSMO in its statement said it had received an unprecedented amount of response within a very short period that raised some concerns about the intentions of the aforementioned communication following the advertisement in question.

Meanwhile it said in response to the incident, along with its ongoing initiatives to improve women’s health in Sri Lanka, it has decided to offer any lady who walks in to OSMO on or before 26th January, a free Physical Fitness Assessment and a free two-week membership with the personalized attention of its qualified fitness instructors.
