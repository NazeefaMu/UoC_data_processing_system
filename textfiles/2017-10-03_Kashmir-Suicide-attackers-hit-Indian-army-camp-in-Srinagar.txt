The operation is on,” said a Srinagar-based police spokesman. The incident took place at 4:30 a.m.

Sources said two militants have managed to sneak into the camps, comprising many buildings. Two militants are holed up inside the administration block. “Firing continues,” said the police.

Unconfirmed reports suggest Jaish-e-Muhammad militant outfit has claimed the responsibility for the attack.
