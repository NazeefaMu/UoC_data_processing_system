Western Province Chief Minister Isura Devapriya’s kneeling before some provincial councillors belonging to the ‘Mahinda Gang’ led to the defeat of the health budget of Western Province presented by the Jathika Hela Urumaya, said the Western Provincial Council's Minister of Health, Nishantha Sri Warnasinghe (of the JHU), yesterday.
The 2016 expenditure head for Western Province Health Ministry, submitted by Warnasinghe, was defeated by 45 votes to 23 last Tuesday.
Asserting that the blame for the first ever defeat of the budget of the Western Provincial Council should be borne by Chief Minister Devapriya, Mr. Warnasinghe said this would cripple the health services provided by the council next year, creating difficulties for the people.
He said this was an act of political revenge by his opponents who were supporters of the former president Mahinda Rajapaksa.
He added that he could face such a situation because he had never knelt before any politician even though he had received unfair requests and threats.
There was no just reason to vote against my budget as not a single allegation was made against my ministry during the three months I served, he said.
He said those who defeated the budget should have brought in a no-confidence motion against him if they disliked him without inconveniencing millions of people.
He said he would soon decide whether to resign his office or not. (Piyumi Fonseka)
