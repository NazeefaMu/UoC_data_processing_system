Disgruntled politico to turn state witness against his former boss?


	

This former Diyawanna member, an ardent follower of the former strongman, in a bizarre U-turn is out gunning for the latter, they say.


	 
This politico who had to spend a few weeks in the main state-run lodge for his doings in the past, is nursing a grudge against the former strongman mainly because the latter failed to use his influence to grant him nomination to contest the August 17 general poll. He also has been blaming the former boss for not doing enough to prevent the law being enforced against him. The man is now poised for a political somersault, they say.  Some Yahapalanaya Ministerial ones say that the disgruntled politico had quite openly expressed his sentiments and future plans during his recent visit to the home turf of the former strongman.
But certain intimates of the unhappy one maintain that he has not agreed to give evidence against his former mentor. However, all interested parties eagerly await the politico’s next move for it could be another surprise!
