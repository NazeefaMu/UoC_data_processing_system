Miss Charlotte Wanigasekera She was known for her hospitality


	

Miss Charlotte Wanigasekera came from a Baptist family from Mugunuwatawana, a small village of Madampe in North Western Province.   


She had two sisters and four brothers. When I met her in 1971 she was the principal of a school in Nawalapitiya.   


She saw to it that the brothers got their education. She encouraged them to get on with their jobs and do well in life.   


She was a selfless lady and opted to remain a spinster. She did a lot for the family.   


I met her, because one of her brothers was married to my husband’s sister. She had encouraged this brother to join the education service after his secondary education at Carey College, Colombo. After his training he ended up as an Asst. Zonal Director of Education.   


She loved the Lord and wanted to serve him. She was a of member of the YWCA and I remember the members of the National YWCA telling me, that they loved the trips to Madampe, where meetings were held.   


Miss Charlotte was an affectionate woman and loved to be hospitable. If we visited her she would never send us off without giving us a meal. We remember her sumptuous meals, not forgetting a super duper cashew curry, prepared by Miss Charlotte and her team.   


It was a real shock when we got the news of her demise just three months ago. Two days before she passed away she spoke to me on the phone to inquire about my husband who was in hospital. She told me do not worry.   


She had many nieces and nephews and she was Mamma to them and sister to us.


She was a disciplined lady and this is what she imparted to the next generation. She was much loved and respected by not only by the family, but by all who knew her.   


She was an active member of the Baptist women’s League and nurtured a young group of women. 


Her dream was to have a little Baptist Church in her Village, Mugunuwatawana.   


God permitted it to lake place before she was called to a better home. There is a small Baptist church at Mugunuwatawana, looked after by a very active young worker. To God be the glory for the great things He has done.   


She was 96 years of age when she left us. May her soul rest in peace.
