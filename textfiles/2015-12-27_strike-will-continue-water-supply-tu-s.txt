	The Water Supply Joint Trade Union Alliance said today the island wide trade union action launched yesterday will continue as authorities had failed to address their demands.
	The Alliance launched the action demanding the payment of their annual bonus. Trade Union Leader Upali Ratnayaka said emergency services and breakdown services had come to a standstill yesterday but water purification system had not been interrupted because of the strike.
	 “However water supply to several areas including Chillaw, Matara and Biyagama was interrupted,” he said.
	Ratnayaka said they would refrain from maintaining water systems in the future which would lead to the supply of water being interrupted in more areas.
	When contacted National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NSWDB) Director Ranjith Balasooriya said the strike had not affected the authority on a very large scale.
	“We will continue work with the employees that we have outsourced,” he said.
	Speaking of the bonus over which the trade union is now on strike, Balasooriya said a bonus of Rs. 25,000 had already been paid but the unions were demanding Rs. 37, 500.
	Discussions are to be held between the unions and the NSWDB officials tomorrow. (DS)
