Protest against garbage!


	



A protest was staged today by the residents of Ekala against the plans to relocate the Meethotamulla garbage dump to Ekala. Despite probably being the cleanest country in South Asia, Sri Lanka has so far failed to set up a working mechanism to recycle its garbage in a sustainable manner.Pix by Pradeep Pathirana
