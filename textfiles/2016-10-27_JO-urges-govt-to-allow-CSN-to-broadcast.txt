JO urges govt. to allow CSN to broadcast


	

The Joint Opposition today urged the government to reverse the decision to suspend the broadcasting license of Carlton Sports Network (CSN) stating that suspension of the licence would set a dangerous precedent.

Joint Opposition group leader Dinesh Gunawardane, who made a statement in Parliament with regard to the matter, said the licence of CSN had been suspended on the grounds that it was working towards the interests of a political party.

"The CSN does not work towards the interests of a political party and we urge the government to reverse this decision,” he said.

Media Minister Gayantha Karunatilleke in response ruled out the retracting the suspension as the TV Channel had not produced financial statements, violating the conditions on which the licence was given.

He said the channel had not noticed the authorities of the change of address as per the conditions as well.

Minister of Finance Ravi Karunanayake, who joined in the cross talk, said the channel had defaulted payments of duties as well. (Yohan Perera)
