Police today launched a 13-day long operation to inspect vehicles with tinted or curtained front windows.

The operation will continue till January 31.

Police said front windscreen of the vehicle should also be clear.

“It has been found that the rise of accidents involving motor vehicles is largely due to tinted or curtained front windows,” police said.

“The use of tinted glasses is appended in Government Gazette 875/08 on 16.06.1995 and Gazette number 1273/28 on 31.01,2003. It is an offence for the windscreen and the two shutters besides the driver to be tinted. A 20% tinted glass could be used only on the top portion of the windscreen,” the Gazette states.

Police Spokesman DIG Priyantha Jayakody said Police would strictly implement the regulation and track down vehicles that have any kind of tinted glass or curtains in the front, during the operation.

He said motorists would be warned for the first time but legal action would be taken if the tint or curtains were not removed.

Earlier DIG Traffic said that it was legal to tint or curtain the back windows and VIP vehicles coming under the purview of Ministries were exempted from this regulation, if they had the necessary approval.

The Police carried out a similar operation in October 2016.(Darshana Sanjeewa)
