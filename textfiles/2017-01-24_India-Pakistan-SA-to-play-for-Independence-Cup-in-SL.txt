Sri Lanka will host the tournament as part of their 70th Independence day celebrations.

According to Sumathipala, India agreed to participate in the series after Sri Lankan Prime Minister Ranil Wickramasinghe discussed this with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi .

“The Indians would be visiting South Africa in the time when we are scheduling the tour, so this matter will be discussed with India and South Africa during the next month’s ICC meeting in Dubai regarding Independence Cup and then we all (Sri Lanka, India, South Africa and Pakistan) will accommodate each other,” he further added.

The Sri Lanka Cricket Board will soon reveal the dates and venues of the quadrangular cricketing eventevent once the formal procedures are done and dusted.
