Bulky one has gone sulky!


	



 

The swarthy big one who lost his high office soon after switching from finance to foreign affairs is said to be visiting places of religious worship one after another here and abroad these days seeking divine blessings to see an end to the malefic period he is going through. 

 


The former purohita was seen taking things in stride until his kinsman running the development lottery was given the walking papers. Informed sources say that it was the authority in the highest echelons who was responsible for the ouster, not the purohita handling the subject. 


The man is in a sulk these days over the shabby treatment meted out to his kinsman after his fall, they say.
