	The United National Party (UNP) said yesterday it had no issues about the appointment of Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) members to the Cabinet of Ministers.
	“A national government is a necessity and we have no issues about ministerial portfolios being given to SLFPers,” UNP deputy general secretary and official spokesman Akila Viraj Kariyawasam told Daily Mirror yesterday.
	He said his party was ready to work within the concept of a national government and pointed out that the work which the present regime started would continue despite the new move.
	Mr. Kariyawasam said it would only be a temporary move because the government would go in for a general election after April 21 this year as planned.
	Several SLFP members were expected to be appointed as state ministers last evening.(YP)
