Norwegian Research Vessel ‘Dr Fridtjof Nansen' will assist Sri Lanka to conduct a stock assessment of marine resources next year, a statement said yesterday.

In a statement, the Norwegian embassy said the planning seminar is taking place in Colombo for the New Norwegian Research vessel to come to Sri Lankan waters in 2018 to carry out a survey on the marine resources. This is part of the technical and institutional cooperation on Fisheries between Norway and Sri Lanka, which was endorsed by the top level political authorities of the two countries.

“The aim of the planned survey is to know the current status of marine resources including fish stocks and to investigate stocks of unexploited/ underutilized fishery resources on the continental shelf and slope. The last stock assessment for Sri Lanka has been carried out by the previous Dr. Fridtjof Nansen in 1978 to 1980.

"The new marine research vessel RV Dr Fridtjof Nansen is owned by the Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (NORAD) and is jointly operated by the Institute of Marine Research of Norway, and Food and Agriculture organization to help developing countries improve their fisheries management," the statement said.

The Norwegian Ambassador Thorbjørn Gaustadsæther addressing a distinguished gathering at an event to recognize the finalization of the planing schedules for the Vessel’s arrival to the Bay of Bengal said the new research vessel would make it possible to significantly step up Norway's assistance for ecosystem-based marine management in developing countries. He said this was part of the new Ocean strategy of Norway and Norway considers this as ‘creating partnerships for the oceans’ as it enhances sharing knowledge both across industries and across international borders.
