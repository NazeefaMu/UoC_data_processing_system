Subject sans Heart line is selfish and cold-blooded

The Heart line originates in most cases from the Mount of Jupiter or the Mount of Saturn and runs across the palm under the Mounts of Apollo and Mercury to terminate on the percussion.


This line is found in most hands. Occasionally, only one line crossing the upper portion of the hand under the Mounts and terminating on the percussion is seen, making it difficult to say whether it is the Heart line or the Head line. However, palmists treat this one line as the Head line and consider in such a case, the Heart line is missing.


The lines on the palm are controlled by the brain which is linked to the Head line. Therefore, the Head line should necessarily appear on the palm.

 

Cold-blooded and Selfish
The absence of the Heart line indicates that the owner is cold-blooded and selfish. He would seek success at the expense of grievous injury or death of another. If the Heart line is missing from both hands, the subject could be a big bully or a bluffer.


If the Heart line is clear, distinct, faultless, and pink or reddish, the subject would achieve success in life, gaining fame and respect of the society.


There are three established readings relating to the rising point of the Heart line, but they are subject to modifications depending on variations of the line.


The three readings are:
(1) The line rising from the Mount of Jupiter: The subject is kind and affectionate. His love is genuine.
(2) The line rising from between the Mounts of Jupiter and Saturn: The subject is endowed with common sense and is practical in regard to love and affections. He is not carried away by sentiment. He is capable of coming to terms with reality. He would not seek a love unattainable nor would pine away over its loss.


(3) The line rising from the Mount of Saturn: The subject is a seeker after sensual pleasures. His love for a member of the opposite sex is more physical than spiritual. If his Mount of Venus is large and red or pink in colour, his passion for sex is unusually strong and if his line of Mars is strong, it indicates he would succeed in fulfilling his desires using even his physical strength.


A clear Heart line and a strong thumb are necessary to prevent the Heart ruling the Head which could lead to failure in life.


The Heart line leaning towards Head line at its start signifies that the subject is ruled by his head rather than by the heart.


Should the Heart line originate from the Head line, the subject would be fully controlled by the head or by reason.


The Heart line terminating after running a short distance indicates a serious difficulty at the date the line stops despite all other lines running their course. The sudden ending of the Heart line far short of the percussion, would mean either the heart would cease to function or the subject is too self-centered to have any consideration for others.


The length of the Heart line is important. The line is normal when it runs across the palm to terminate on the percussion. In certain cases, the line starting under the Mount of Jupiter ends under the Mount of Saturn. Such a line indicates short life.


The Heart line terminating on the Mount of Apollo says that that the subject is a great lover of art and beauty.


The Heart line terminating under the Mount of Mercury indicates that the subject attaches more importance to money or wealth than to love. The line ending on the upper Mars signifies that the subject is attracted to Martian qualities like aggressiveness, dynamism and fighting spirit.


If the Heart line makes a sudden deflection towards the Mount of Moon, the subject would be a jealous person. He would be very pessimistic in outlook.


The character of the Heart line is vital for making a reading. For the Heart line to be perfect or near perfect, it should be uniformly distinct and unmarred by breaks, islands or other defects throughout its course. Such a good line signifies strong love affairs, consistency in love, good blood circulation and good physical condition of the heart.


A thin Heart line indicates selfishness and little care for others.

 

Often fall in love and fall out of love 
The broad and shallow line indicates a measure of physical weakness of the heart. Such subjects are not consistent in love. They often fall in love and fall out of it. If all other lines are also defective, the subject is not at all reliable.


The chained formation of the Heart line is also not favourable. The chained Heart line with a large Amount of Venus signifies the subject is a flirt. Remember that the Heart, Head and Life lines indicate the age of the subject and the age can be determined by the measurement of the line.


The qualities of this line as in the case of other lines are applicable only to the period for which it is chained, thick, thin broad or shallow.

 

Islands, an indication of a weak heart
The islands on the Heart line are a defect which indicates the weak physical condition of the heart.
Cross-bars cutting the Heart line show either heart trouble or worries caused by affections.
Dots on the line point to defects in health.


Stars on the line too indicate illness or sorrows caused by unrequited love or separation of loved ones. A star on the line below the Mount of Saturn indicates Rheumatism. A well-formed large star at the centre of the line indicates a sudden heart attack at the age to be determined through the measurement of the line.
