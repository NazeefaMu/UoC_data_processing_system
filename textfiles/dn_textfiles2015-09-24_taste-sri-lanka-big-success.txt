Taste of Sri Lanka a big success

The aroma, colours, local culture and the sea of Sri Lankan cuisine enthusiasts brought together a vivid narrative of a true Sri Lankan experience as the Boardwalk Garden at Waters Edge was completely transformed into a Sri Lankan village. With typical native quirks, activities and a feast like none other was held from September 10 to the 13.

A vast number of guests were pleased with the delicious plethora of classical Sri Lankan dishes. Similar to the vast geographical variances of the country, the cooking techniques, flavours and certain ingredients greatly differ from region to region. For the purpose of introducing and presenting such variances in the spice-rich cuisine of Sri Lanka, Waters Edge initiated 'Tastes of Sri Lanka- featuring King of Hoppers Chef Ravi & Rotti Maestro Chef Farris".
The 'All You Can Eat Buffet' provided the perfect opportunity to experience a united island with authentic Sri Lankan cuisine featuring a galore of signature mains ranging from Lamprais, Red/Yellow Rice, a spicy range of Kottu/ Rotti and of course a spectacular selection of Hoppers.
Over 60 Sri Lankan dishes originating from distinctive regions of the island prepared to different recipes, were enjoyed by all the guests. The specialty in Sri Lankan food is that the same food is differently made in different regions; Negombo Pork Stew with Liver, Batticaloa Mutton Curry, Jaffna Kool Curry are a few dishes out of the many which were made able over the weekend at the Boardwalk.
Boardwalk was completely transformed into a 'village' setup with pol athu huts and guests were welcomed and served by the staff dressed in redda & hatta for the ladies and sarongs for the gents. With a traditional arrack cocktail at hand the guests were entertained with an exciting cultural show with traditional yaka dances and fire entertainers on all four days. As a nightcap to end the perfect evening Chef Ravi brewed Yaara or Ginger tea for all diners at each of their tables; making it a show of its own with his bright smile and intriguing humour.
