The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) today condemned the arrest of students who were protesting against the SAITM and said they would launch a 4-hour token strike starting from 8 a.m. tomorrow.

Issuing a statement, the trade union said an urgent executive committee meeting was summoned this evening to discuss the arrest of protesting students which included medical undergraduates.

"The Committee decided to launch a token strike tomorrow from 8 a.m. to 12 p.m. We urge the authorities to release all medical students who are in custody," it said.

If the students were not released, strong trade union action would be taken, the union warned.
