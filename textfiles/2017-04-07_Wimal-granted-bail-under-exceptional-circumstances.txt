National Freedom Front (NFF) Leader MP Wimal Weerawansa was released on bail by Colombo Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne today on exceptional circumstances.

He was released on a cash bail of Rs. 50,000 with two sureties of Rs. 500,000 each.  The Magistrate also imposed a travel ban on Mr. Weerawansa.

Considering the unpredictable time period that the suspect could be in remand custody, the possible delay of the inquiry and the health condition of the suspect's daughter, the Magistrate decided to grant him bail. (Shehan Chamika Silva)
