In a message of greetings to the19th National Congress of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), General Secretary of the Communist Party of Sri Lanka (CPSL) DEW Gunasekara said that despite the collapse of socialism in Europe and the advent of neo-liberalism, China has steered its new economic strategy aggressively and undeterred by negative developments globally and geo-politically.  

The vision of Deng Xiaoping paved the way for China’s vast and fast strides in development, reaching its turning point in 2010 when it became the second largest economy in the world, he added.   

When the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of Sri Lanka met in Colombo, during the period September 29th to October 1st through a Special Resolution moved by the General Secretary, Comrade DEW Gunasekara decided to convey the following message of revolutionary greetings to the National Congress of the Communist Party of China and through it to its core leader Comrade Xi Jinping, the General Secretary and to the Central Committee. 

Gunasekara, who is also a former Cabinet minister, and Chairman of the Parliamentary Oversight Committee said, “The relations between the Communist Party of China and the Communist Party of Sri Lanka can be traced back to the pre-revolutionary days of China when the founding leaders of our two Parties had established contacts and communications,” he said.

“Soon after the revolution in 1949, the relations between our two parties were consolidated by a series of meetings between our two leaderships.   

“It is with great pride that we recall the days when our Party carried on a consistent and uninterrupted campaign for the recognition of new China and also the establishment of diplomatic relations between our two Countries.  

“The Rubber-Rice Agreement between Sri Lanka and China in 1952 was initiated with the fullest backing of the Communist Party of Sri Lanka, both within Parliament and outside. The anti-Chinese trends that emerged at the instance of Imperialist pressures were frustrated by the ideological offensive of the Sri Lankan Communists,” he pointed out.  

With the new economic strategy of reforms and the openings in 1978, saw China enter a new phase of accelerated development.  

“The exchange of views between our two Parties at the highest level of our leaderships reinforced and strengthened the relations between our two countries and our two Parties.  

“Lifting 800 million people out of poverty within the shortest period of time has amazed the International community and thereby China has earned the love and admiration of the peoples, the world over.  

“Strictly adhering to principles of Marxism and upholding its long-term perspective of Socialism, the Communist Party of China has infused courage and confidence in the working people, the world over. Its policy of peace and development as applied to its bold initiative of Belt andRoad has created confidence in the developing economies,” Gunasekara stressed.   

“The co-operation extended by China towards the spheres of socio-economic-cultural development of Sri Lanka has strengthened our feelings of fraternity and solidarity.  

“The traditional relations between our two peoples over several centuries have now been consolidated on a sounder basis of mutual understanding.  

“The 21st National Congress of the Communist Party of Sri Lanka expresses its determination and wishes for further consolidation of fraternal relations between our two Parties,” he said.  

“It is the fervent wish of the 21st National Congress of our Party that the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China will bring more victories to the Chinese People.  

“The 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China is being convened at a time when the world community is facing unprecedented formidable global challenges.  

“The Communist Party of China accomplishing its internationalist duty and role has already taken meaningful steps as solutions to those global challenges. China as a decisive factor in the world development through the deliberations and decisions at the 19th National Congress shall show the way forward guiding the destinies of the posterity.  

“It is the wish of the Sri Lankan Communists that the 19th National Congress will be another landmark Congress in the history of the Communist Party of China,” Gunasekara concluded.
