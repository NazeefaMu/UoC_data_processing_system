Gamma Irradiation technology is one of the trusted technology to enhance the food quality and food safety. 


Further, it is used to sterilize the medical devices and packaging.  Sri Lanka Atomic Energy Board (SLAEB) introduced this gamma irradiation technology to the Sri Lankan industrialists by establishing Sri Lanka Gamma Centre (SLGC) in Biyagama Export Processing Zone in year 2014 which is now  accredited for GMP, ISO 9001 and ISO 13485 standards.  


In order to promote this technology, SLAEB has organized a workshop together with a facility visit on 09th March at Sri Lanka Gamma Centre in Biyagama Export Processing Zone. 


Two experts from International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) will conduct the lectures. Lectures on Food irradiation and its legal acceptance in Global arena and Protecting public health by food and medical device irradiation programs will be conducted by Prof. Suresh Pillai, Director, National Centre  for Electron Beam Research, Professor in microbiology & Texas A&M AgriLife Research Faculty Fellow, Texas A&M University. A lecture on Irradiation of Medical Products in Global context and other applications will be done by IAEA Radiation Processing Specialist Dr. Sunil Sabharwal.  An overview of Gamma Irradiation & Sri Lanka Gamma Centre will be given by Mrs. Samantha Kulatunge, Director of the Centre.  


The main services of this Centre are sterilization of disposable medical products, surgical products, Cellulosic products, Pharmaceuticals & Containers,  Laboratory Supplies, Cosmetics and Sanitary Products, Biological Materials and decontamination of spices, seasonings, dried vegetables, medicinal herbs, Ayurvedic products and health diet supplements. In addition the SLGC can provide services such as quarantine treatment of wooden objects, coir & coir based products, pasteurization of frozen/fresh & dried seafood, and sprout inhibition of onions, garlic, & potatoes.
