	While an unusually great number of US envoys visited Sri Lanka during the past couple of months, it appears that they tend to spend more time in Sri Lanka instead of the US Congress or the State Department, UPFA MP Dullas Alahapperuma said today.
	He stated that six US envoys had visited Sri Lanka during the past four months and it was questionable if their intentions were pure.
	Addressing a new conference at the Dr. N.M. Perera Centre in Borella, he stated that Sri Lanka has to contemplate if the visits made by US envoys were out of goodwill. The US had unusually made so many representations to our country, he mentioned.
	US Assistant Secretary for South and Central Asian Affairs Nisha Biswal, US Ambassador to the UN Samantha Power, United States Secretary of State John Kerry, US Under Secretary Thomas Shannon and US Assistant Secretary for Democracy and Human Rights and Labour Tom Malinowski were among those arrived in Sri Lanka this year.
	Mr. Alahapperuma pointed out that Sri Lanka had today adopted a pro-western foreign policy and it was a principle of the UNP.
	“However, the foreign policy of the SLFP, the President’s party was not pro-western. Therefore, there will be complications in our foreign policy in future,” he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
