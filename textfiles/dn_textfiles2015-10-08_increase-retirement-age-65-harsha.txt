Increase retirement age to 65 - Harsha

The retirement age should be increased to 65 years, Foreign Affairs Deputy Minister Dr. Harsha de Silva said.
Speaking at the National Pensioners' Day Symposium at the Sri Lanka Foundation Institute yesterday, de Silva said Sri Lanka does not have a sustainable pension structure.
"Problems relating to pensioners have been ignored. Sri Lanka has more women than men. Statistics have revealed that men live up to 72 years while women live for 78 years. According to the latest labour force report, the labour force is 8.8 million of which 5.5 million are males and 2.5 million are females. This will generate problems in the future. Male participation is more in the labour force though there are more women in the country," he said.
De Silva said only 47 percent of the people are employed in this country.
"We need to create more jobs to attract more into the labour force. More opportunities should be created for women. The female participation in the labour force has to be increased. If more people are employed, the government will have more resources. The government's priority is to create a highly competitive social market economy," the deputy minister said.
Around 2.5 million people contribute to the public provident fund while nearly 170,000 people contribute to the private provident fund. Nearly 55 percent do not have sufficient coverage. Those outside the labour force also do not receive benefits, he said. De Silva said for a person to get the pension has to work in the public sector for 20 years.
The National Pensioners Day is celebrated to recognise pensioners who contribute to the development of the nation, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said as the Chief Guest at the event. The Sri Lanka Pensions Department along with the government intends to provide better facilities and benefits to the pensioners, he said.
Jayasuriya said the government spends over Rs. 15 million on pensioners per month.
