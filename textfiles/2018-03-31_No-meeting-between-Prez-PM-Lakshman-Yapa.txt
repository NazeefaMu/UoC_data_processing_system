State Minister Lakshman Yapa Abeywardane yesterday rejected media reports that President Maithripala Sirisena had met Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe on Thursday to discuss the no-confidence motion against the Prime Minister.

He told a news conference that President’s Media informed him that there had been no discussion on the matter.

The State Minister said such false news was spread by those who are not confident on their own stance on the no-faith motion.(Dayana Udhayanagani)
