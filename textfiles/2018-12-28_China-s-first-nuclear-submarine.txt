Precious black-and-white footage showing China's first nuclear submarine being launched has been released by Chinese state media. 

The landmark warship Changzheng-1 tested the water nearly 50 years ago witnessed by passionate crowds as they applauded and hailed to the leadership of the Communist Party, which had by then ruled China for just over a decade.

The vessel was completed during the Chairman Mao era and when China was going through the turbulent decade known as the Cultural Revolution.

The video was released by China's state broadcaster CCTV on its Twitter-like Weibo after U.S. media last week reported that Beijing had tested a new submarine nuclear missile that could reach North America.

The clip was a part of a programme to mark the memorable achievements in China's military and industry since the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949.

It was originally broadcast in April last year and was published on Wednesday again to celebrate the 48th anniversary of the launch of Changzheng-1, which was also known as the Type 091 submarine. (Daily Mail)
