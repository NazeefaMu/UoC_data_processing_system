The cabinet meeting held yesterday became very tense owing to a clash that erupted between the Minister of Highways and Higher Education Lakshman Kiriella and the Minister of Sports Dayasiri Jayasekera. Sources revealed that an argument arose between these two ministers on the construction of the section from Pothuhera to Kandy of the Central Expressway led to this tense situation.

Minister Jayasekera had pointed out to the Minister Kiriella to refrain from obtaining a loan at a very high interest for the construction of this section and instead act according to the priorities identified. In reply Minister Kiriella had said that whatever others may say the construction of the central expressway was very necessary and the work would go on.

Minister Kiriella had then challenged Minister Jayasekera to leave the government without leveling charges. As the situation worsened President Maithripala Sirisena who was chairing the meeting settled the dispute. (Ajantha Kumara Agalakada)
