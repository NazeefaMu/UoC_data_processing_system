A big gun in the Green party has now become the target of the growing anger of the party’s unhappy backbencher-rebels.

 


These members have learnt that this big gun who made it to Diyawanna through the list is the villain responsible for sabotaging all the proposals they submit to the party leadership. 


The young rebels who held a powwow the other day had, one by one lambasted the national list-character and they had finally decided to submit a letter to the leader giving a list of doings of the big gun damaging to the party. 


However, some of the young rebels had voiced their fears that if someone by any chance spilled the beans to their ‘villain’, it would not only upset the apple cart, but also some of them might even face expulsion from the party.
