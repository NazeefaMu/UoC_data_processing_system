Black Caps batting blitz leads to huge Twenty20 win over Sri Lanka

Auckland duo Martin Guptill and Colin Munro have put on a batting blitz to lead New Zealand to a massive nine-wicket win over Sri Lanka in the second Twenty20 at Eden Park on Sunday.
 
Chasing 143 for victory, the Black Caps needed just 10 overs to reach their target.
 
After Guptill plundered 63 off just 25 balls, including five sixes and six fours, and was then the only wicket to fall, it was hard to imagine he would be bettered as the hosts waltzed to their triumph.
 
But Munro came in and treated his home crowd to a special innings of his own.
 
The No 3 hit the second fastest international T20 half-century, blasting a remarkable seven sixes and finishing 50 not out from only 14 balls as the Black Caps wrapped up a 2-0 series victory.
 
Skipper Kane Williamson's unbeaten 32 off 21 seemed pedestrian in comparison, the Black Caps skipper getting the best seat in the house as Guptill and Munro found the middle of the bat over and over again.
 
A masterful 81 not out off just 49 balls from test captain Angelo Mathews rescued the visitors' stuttering innings, his being easily the main contribution in their 142-8.
 
But his efforts were to be in vain, the Kiwis coming out and swiftly going about putting on a show for the 17,058 crowd.
 
Between the top order trio, there was a stunning 12 sixes and 10 fours. Munro put the exclamation point on the result with a towering six to seal victory.
 
New Zealand 147-1 (Martin Guptill 63, Colin Munro 50*, Kane Williamson 32*) Sri Lanka 142-8 (Angelo Mathews 81*, Tillikaratne Dilshan 28, Grant Elliott 4-22, Mitchell Santner 2-24, Adam Milne 2-36)
