Minister of Power and Energy and Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) General Secretary Patali Champika Ranawaka said today the cabinet paper submitted to grant government compensation for injured LTTE terrorists had to be withdrawn after he protested against it.
“Some ministers submitted a cabinet paper proposing that the injured LTTE terrorists should be compensated by the government. I strongly objected it and it had to be withdrawn,” he said.
Minister Ranawaka said JHU was strongly opposed to hosting a festival of Diaspora as claimed by the Foreign Affairs Ministry and that hosting such a discussion would instigate racisms and terrorism.
“There has been no discussion within the government about this. We do not think hosting such a discussion with organizations banned by the defense ministry through a gazette notification would ensure peace in the country. It is an instigation of terrorism,” Mr. Ranawaka said.
He said if this issue was to be resolved, those Tamil Diaspora organizations should accept the unitary state of the country and that such issues could not be resolved holding discussions while they were still stick to Tamil Eelam and added that it was done to achieve petty political ends.
“This government has not received any mandate to have discussion with separatists. It should obtain a mandate to have such discussions,” he said. (Ajith Siriwardana)
