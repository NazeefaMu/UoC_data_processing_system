Health Minister should ask himself why he was afraid of quitting the Mahinda Rajapaksa government until President Maithripala Sirisena did so to join the coalition against the then government, the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) said today.
Responding to a question asked by a journalist at a media briefing, GMOA spokesman Dr. Navin de Soysa said they were never scared of former defense secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa or any politician in the country and never sucked up to them.
He said that during a discussion, President Sirisena had admitted that the GMOA was not an association which had any political agendas even though some politicians had criticized the GMOA . (Piyumi Fonseka)
