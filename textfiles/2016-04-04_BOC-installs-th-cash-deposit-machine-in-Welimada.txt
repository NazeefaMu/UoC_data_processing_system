The Bank of Ceylon (BOC) now has a cash deposit machine (CDM) network that is spread over many provinces of the country enabling BOC cardholders to transact with ease from anywhere within the country. 


The newest 50th CDM was installed in the Uva province- Welimada expanding its ATM and CDM nework to 607 machines covering the whole island. 
The latest addition of CDMs to the BOC network consists of facilities of real time cash deposit to any account, fund transferring,credit card settlement apart from every other facility that is provided through a common ATM such as cash withdrawals, account balance inquiries and printing mini-account statements throughout the day. 


Being bankers to the nation, BOC takes pride in assisting Sri Lankans from all walks of life providing them the best service at locations most convenient to them. In extending this new technology to Colombo, suburbs and outstations alike, BOC fulfills its promise to be a responsible bank that looks into the banking feasibility of the whole country. 
With its 626 branch network and the 607 ATM/CDM Network BOC’s customer touch points now exceed 1200. Along with the bank’s digital transformation BOC has introduced state-of-the-art branch concepts in several provinces. 


Adding much sophistication BOC began its “Transformation” project to deliver best-in-class banking service to its customers. Under this project Bank has established state-of-the-art branches to extend the world class banking service experience to its customers. 


BOC introduced the SmartZone concept in selected branches across the country enabling customers 24 X7 access to banking services. These SamrtZones consist of CDMs and ATMs. 
Addressing the social need of sophisticated and secure digital channels for banking BOC upgraded its online banking facility along with its newest feature “SmartGen” where traditional passbook has been replaced through emails and SMS alerts also enabling the customer to walk into any BOC branch without producing identification to transact as customer image has been stored in the centralized system at the time of opening the account. 


Being more customer-centric BOC opened up its Facebook and twitter account at the end of 2015 enabling its customers to approach and feel the bank more closely.   


BOC was named as the Strongest Bank in the country for the year 2015 by the prestigious “The Asian Banker” and it earned global recognition as one of the top 1000 banks in the world, (Country rank No.1) as listed by “The Banker Magazine” (UK) respectively in 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015. 
The bank has passed exceptional milestones in recent years such as becoming the first to gain over Rs.1.5 trillion assets and over Rs.1trillion deposits. 


Fitch Rating Lanka has ranked the BOC at AA+(lka) which is the highest rating awarded to a local commercial bank and ICRA (lk) has awarded AAA rating which is the highest credit quality rating issued by ICRA Lanka.
