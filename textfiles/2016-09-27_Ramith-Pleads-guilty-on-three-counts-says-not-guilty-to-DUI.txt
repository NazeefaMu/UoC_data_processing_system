Colombo Additional Magistrate Chandana Kalansooriya today suspended the driving licence of Cricketer Ramith Rambukwella following an accident that occurred at Independence Avenue, Colombo 7 recently.

The Cinnamon Garden Police had put forward five charges against the suspect including Drunken Driving, Negligent Driving, Not Avoiding a Possible Accident, Driving a Vehicle Registered under someone else’s name and driving with a Fake Number Plate.

The Police told court that it was revealed at the time of the accident the suspect was under the influence of alcohol.

Later, he was produced before a JMO to examine on the injuries to him from the accident and the JMO in his report had stated that the suspect had a smell of alcohol as well.

However, after pleading guilty on the two charges of Negligent Driving and Not Avoiding a Possible Accident, the Counsel who appeared on behalf of the suspect pleaded not guilty on the other charges of Drunken Driving, Driving a Vehicle Registered under someone else’s name and driving with a Fake Number Plate.

The Magistrate put off the case for further proceedings and to furnish bail requirements on October 18.
The suspect Ramith is Parliamentarian Keheliya Rambukwella’s son and is currently on Police bail.(Shehan Chamika Silva)
