Did he convey a cryptic message!


	



 

Yahapalanaya Number One had given a lengthy pep talk to his office aides at a confab held at Nelum Pokuna recently.

 


Number One in his address had touched on a wide range of topics, but all that he said boiled down to the cryptic message: Get ready for 2020, they say.


Some of the aides had construed ‘2020’ as the Presidential poll due in 2020. But others had pointed out that their boss never referred to that poll during his speech. Nevertheless, most of them feel that Number One meant the Presidential poll when he mentioned ‘2020’, given the present indications that all plans aimed at introducing a new Constitution have gone haywire.
