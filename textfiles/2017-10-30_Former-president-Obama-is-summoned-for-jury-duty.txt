US, (Daily Mail) 28 October 2017 -Former President Barack Obama has been called to serve jury duty in Chicago.


Cook  County Chief Judge Tim Evans told county commissioners during a budget  hearing on Friday that the former commander-in-chief, who owns homes in  both Washington, DC, and Chicago’s Kenwood neighborhood, will serve in  November.


Evans told the Chicago Tribune  that necessary precautions would be taken to accommodate security and  scheduling needs. He did not specify the date or courthouse location  Obama will report to next month.


Obama, who is registered to vote in  Chicago, is not the first celebrity to serve jury duty in Cook County.  In 2004, legendary talk show host Oprah Winfrey was called to serve for a  Chicago murder trial.


Jurors can be summoned for civil or criminal trials and can be called to any of the county’s Chicago or suburban courthouses.


‘Although  it’s not a place where the public can earn a lot of money, it is highly  appreciated,’ Evans said of Obama’s choice to serve. ‘It’s crucial that  our society get the benefit of that kind of commitment.’


Jurors in Cook County are paid $17.20 for each day of service.
