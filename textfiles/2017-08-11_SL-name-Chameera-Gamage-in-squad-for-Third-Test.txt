SL name Chameera, Gamage in squad for Third Test


	

The National Cricket Selectors yesterday included two fast-bowlers to their 15-member squad for the Third and Final Test match against India which will commence at the Pallekele Stadium in Kandy on Saturday (12).

The National Selectors also decided to leave out top order batsman Danushka Gunathilaka.

 
Lahiru Gamage, who has previously featured in five ODIs for Sri Lanka, and Dushmantha Chameera have been included with Rangana Herath and Nuwan Pradeep missing out due to injuries. 


Herath strained his back and following the advice of the Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) Medical Unit was deemed unavailable for selection, also considering the large workload he has undertaken in recent Tests.

 
Pradeep was injured during the first day of the Second Test, which Sri Lanka lost by an innings and 53 runs, and was ruled out for at least two weeks with a hamstring tear.

 
Gamage had largely uneventful returns in his five ODIs, taking just two wickets, and is a surprise addition given ordinary recent performances. 

Chameera meanwhile, last played a Test in South Africa last year, but featured in four of the five ODIs against Zimbabwe – the series that Sri Lanka lost 2-3. 


Sri Lanka have already lost the series having suffered defeats in Galle and Colombo earlier this month and are on the brink of being whitewashed by the Indians at home for the first time.

 
Sri Lanka Squad: 
Dinesh Chandimal (Captain), Angelo Mathews, Upul Tharanga, Dimuth Karunaratne, Niroshan Dickwella, Kusal Mendis, Dhananjaya de Silva, Lahiru Thirimanne, Lahiru Kumara, Vishwa Fernando, Dushmantha Chameera, Lahiru Gamage, Dilruwan Perera, Malinda Pushpakumara and Lakshan Sandakan.
