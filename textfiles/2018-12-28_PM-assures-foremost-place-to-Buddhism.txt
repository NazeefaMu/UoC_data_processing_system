Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe today vassured the Ven. Mahanayake Theras of Malwathu and Asgiriya Chapters that the government would give the foremost place to Buddhism and that action would be taken against those who vandalized Buddha statues in Mawanella.

He said this when he met the Asgiriya Mahanayaka most Ven. Warakagoda Gnaratana Thera and the Malwathu Mahanayaka most Ven. Tibatuwawe Sri Sidaratha Thera in Kandy.

“I informed the Mahanayaka Theras that I have already spoken to opposition political parties and have come to an agreement not to change the wordings of Article 9 of the Constitution which gives the foremost place to Buddhism,” the Prime Minister said. “ I also told the Prelates that we will shortly launch a programme of granting concessions to people in rural areas.”

The Prime Minister thanked the Prelates for the role they played in ensuring the rule of law during the recent political crisis. (Yohan Perera and J.A.L. Jayasinghe)
