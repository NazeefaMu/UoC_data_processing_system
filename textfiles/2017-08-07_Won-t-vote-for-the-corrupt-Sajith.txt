Minister of Housing and Construction Sajith Premadasa said over the weekend that he would resign from his Ministerial post if he were asked to vote in favour of corrupt people in Parliament.

Mr. Premadasa made this statement at the opening of Manabarana Gama in Siyambalanduwa in the Moneragala District, the 35th village under his Uda-Gammana Programme on Saturday.

"I will resign from the Cabinet and take to the streets against corruption if anyone asked me to defend corrupt people," Mr. Premadasa said.

Mr. Premadasa said one must remember that this Government was elected to get rid of corruption for good.

“Both the President and the Prime Minister always tell us that we should not forget our past,” he said.

“Accordingly we should not forget our past and defend the corrupt people. We will have to end up in the Opposition if we forget the past and embrace corruption," he added. (Yohan Perera)
