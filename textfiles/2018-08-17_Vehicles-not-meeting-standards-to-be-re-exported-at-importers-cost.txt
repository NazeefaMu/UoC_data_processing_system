Vehicles imported on Letters of Credit (LCs) opened after July 13, 2018, should undergo a pre-shipment Emission Inspection and Certification, an Extraordinary Gazette Notice dated August 10 said.

“Motor vehicles, which do not comply with the said Emissions Standards and Safety Measures/Standards, shall be re-exported by the importer(s) at his own cost,” the notice said.

“Importation of all motor vehicles other than brand new motor vehicles referred to in the notice shall carry a Pre-Shipment Inspection Certificate, to comply with the Emissions Standards and Safety Measures/Standards,” it said.

“The Pre-Shipment Inspection Certificate shall only be issued by the authorized inspectors appointed by the Gazette (Extraordinary) No.1804/17 dated April 3, 2013.

“These regulations shall not be applicable for the importation of motor vehicles, based on the Letters of Credit (LCs), established on or before July 13, 2018. “Such Letters of Credit shall not be amended and the imported motor vehicles can be cleared from Sri Lanka Customs on or before October 31, 2018,” it said.
