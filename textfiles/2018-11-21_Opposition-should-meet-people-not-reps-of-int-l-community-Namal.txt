UPFA MP Namal Rajapaksa today said UNP, JVP and TNA politicians should meet the people of Sri Lanka rather than the representatives of the international community.  

“Interesting to see UNP, JVP and TNA politicians meeting with the members of the international community. Perhaps if more effort was given towards meeting with the people of Sri Lanka and paying heed to their hope for elections, Sri Lanka can finally achieve its fullest potential,” the parliamentarian tweeted.

Meanwhile, Canadian High Commissioner David McKinnon replying to Rajapaksa said, “You might ask some of your Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna colleagues who they’re meeting with,”

Rajapaksa then thanked the High Commissioner for his engagement. “Recalling that Sri Lanka remains a sovereign nation and home to a brilliant people, the leaders of Sri Lanka, whoever they may be, should focus on engaging with Sri Lankan people and solving their concerns, including their call for elections,” he replied.

@McKinnonDavid thank you for your engagement. Recalling that #lka remains a sovereign nation & home to a brilliant people, the leaders of #SriLanka - whoever they may be, should focus on engaging with Sri Lankan people & solving their concerns, including their call for elections
