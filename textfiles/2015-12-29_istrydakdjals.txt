	Western Province Chief Minister Isura Devapriya today took over the Health Ministry of the Provincial Council, which was previously held by Provincial Councilor Nishantha Sri Warnasinghe.
	Mr. Warnasinghe was the Health Minister of the Provincial Council and subjects including Indigenous Medicine, Social Welfare, Probation and Child Care, Women's Affairs and Provincial Council Affairs were also under his Ministry.
	Chief Minister Isura Devapriya earlier said that he would take over the Ministry of Health after the budget submitted by Mr. Warnasinghe was defeated by 45 votes to 23 on December 22.
	“The thirty eight percent of the funds had been used from the total budgetary allocation for the PC Health Ministry this year. Due to lack of fund management of the ministry, PC Minister Warnasinghe who did not have prior experience, he was unable to continue as a Minister in the council” the Chief Minister said.
	“Mr. Warnasinghe threw a challenge at me to take his ministry. But I did it merely for not accepting his challenge, but according to the powers that are vested upon the Chief Minister under the clause of 154-E5, I have the right to take over any ministry. He had the opportunity to defend the ministry till December 31. Without any discussions he projected the issue in the media. Due to this, he had brought the entire PC Health ministry’s activities to a standstill. From the public’s point of view, the Chief Minister would be responsible for this chaotic situation. Therefore, I had no option but to take over the responsibilities of the ministry and ensure its smooth functioning from January 1 next year,” he said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)
