The family of a Second World War pilot who vanished during a bombing raid have finally found out what happened to him 74 years later - after they discovered the wreckage of his plane preserve in ice.   

The remains of Lieutenant Commander Ron Richardson's Hellcat fighter bomber were found in snow and ice 3,000ft up a mountain in Norway - where they have been since 1944.

Next to the wreckage was an empty shallow grave where the pilot's body was hastily buried by German troops, before later being exhumed and placed in an unmarked grave in a military cemetery. (Daily Mail)
