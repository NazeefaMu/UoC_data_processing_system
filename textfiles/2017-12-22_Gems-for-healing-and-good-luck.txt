From the dawn of the human civilization. gems and other precious stones have been in high demand. From the ancient times, royalty and nobility had taken great pride and pleasure in wearing ornaments studded with precious stones. And over the ages, making of ornaments bedecked with gems and other precious stones has developed into a fine art.

 

Gemstones for more important purposes
Sages from the age of theVedas and Puranas had discovered that the gemstones could serve more useful purposes for the humanity than as jewels for adornment. In fact, the great Indian sage Varahamihira who lived in the 1st century BC has devoted a full chapter to gems and precious stones in his monumental work Brihat Samhita. Another Sanskrit work, Ratnapariksha’ written by Buddhatatta in the 6th century BC dwells at length on the virtues of precious stones and gems and what they symbolize. The ancients had discovered through studies and experiments that different gemstones, create, among other things, varied distinctive reactions on the human body. In fact, the discovery that gems and other precious stones could be used to ward off evil planetary effects added a new dimension to the science of Astrology.

 

Precious stones to heal and usher in fortune
In fact, the ancients had discovered that the precious stones could be used not only to avert malefic planetary influences, but also to heal the sick and to bring fortune and prosperity.

 

Rationale for use of gemstones
The rationale for the use of precious stones as a medium for warding off malefic influences, providing relief from physical ailments, and ushering in fortune and happiness is based on their extra sensitivity to rays emanated by planets. There is a distinct nature or a quality of rays that each planet gives forth. These rays carry certain colours and vibrations which may or may not be in harmony with the body chemistry of a particular individual. Colours and vibrations from planets which are not in harmony with the body chemistry of an individual may bring him disease and misfortune. The ancients have ascribed a particular gem or a precious stone to each planet in accord with the colour of the rays it emanates.

 

Electro-magnetic field around human body
We all know that Sun’s rays are made up of seven colours, violet, indigo, blue, green, yellow, orange and red. These colours produce different vibrations.  The gemstone ascribed to the Sun would regulate their cumulative effect on the human body to produce a favourable impact on the individual.
Every human being has an electromagnetic field around him and the Sun’s rays first interact with this field.


Therefore, the use of different gems and precious stones in Astrology is based on the colour and vibration effects made on the human body by the rays of different planets. Gems and precious stones possess both preventive and curative qualities. Therefore, when using gems and precious stones for the cure and prevention of diseases one should know the parts of the human body controlled by the planets and the signs of the Zodiac involved.
