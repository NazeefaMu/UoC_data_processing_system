Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake responding to a notice issued to him yesterday to appear before the Supreme Court on October 25 with regard to alleged contempt of court said he will prove in Courts the veracity of the statements he made on legal professionals.

The Deputy Minister is alleged to have made remarks in contempt of court after he said that certain members in the legal profession were corrupt.

Mr. Ramanayake told the Daily Mirror that he will go before the Supreme Courts and prove the veracity of the statements he made. “I said what I said about the lawyers speaking on behalf of the ordinary people. What I talked about is the plight ordinary people have to undergo when they try to seek redress from courts through some lawyers. I did not refer to all of them but some,” he said.

He said he had already retained a team of honest lawyers including one MP who happens to be a lawyer.

Meanwhile, Mr Ramanayake proposed that all lawyers should be made legally bound to issue receipts for the fees they received from their clients.

“Many professionals such as doctors provide receipts for the payments they charge. Even private sector workers get a pay slip. Therefore lawyers too should be made to give receipts so that one gets an idea on the revenue they generate,” the Deputy Minister added. (Yohan Perera)
