Prices of bread and other bakery products could be increased in the near future, the All Ceylon Bakery Owners’ Association warned today.
The president of the All Ceylon Bakery Owners’ Association said the prices could go up as a result of the Nation Building Tax being to four percent.
He said Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake had turned a deaf ear to their request for a concession, though they had explained the situation to him both in writing and at a meeting held recently.
