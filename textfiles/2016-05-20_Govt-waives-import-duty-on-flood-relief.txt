Government has decided to waive the import duty on the goods being sent to Sri Lanka as flood relief, Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake told Parliament today.

"The Foreign Affairs Minister has briefed the heads of foreign missions who have pledged to provide immediate relief to the badly affected by the rains, floods and landslides. Therefore, all relief items being sent to the country will be free of duty," he said.

The minister said a hotline will be set up soon so that those who wish to provide funds could contact the ministry. (Yohan Perera)
