How music aids cure


	



Music has a Therapeutic value.I am a teacher of Western Music and English with 40 years of experience. Even now, I send pupils for London Examinations. I have taught in popular and less affluent schools, mostly in the Southern Province.   

Now I am in my sixties and I lead a solitary life. I never feel lonely, so long as I play the piano or the electric organ and when I listen to the C.D. player (specially classical and 20th century Music). Then I start playing the melody without looking at the notations. It takes hours and hours. I feel happy and forget all my woes. Depression no more. It’s a remedial measure for me every now and then. I forget all my aches and pains.   

The youngest student who comes to my Western Music class is nearly seven years. She joined my class very recently after having studied under another teacher. She used to cry and was depressed. She hated studying theory. When she joined my class, she had torn her theory book into pieces. Slowly I consoled her and got her to do theory in an interesting way. Now she can play the piano well and will be sitting for the London Music examination early next year. She is an adorable little girl. Sometimes I have heard her singing all by herself, while doing Theory.   

My mother (Thelma Saranasena who is a retired English teacher of Mahinda College, Galle) passed away five years back at the age of 91. She wasn’t bedridden during the final stages of her life. Whenever she was in pain she would ask me to play the piano or to switch on the C.D. player to listen to light music. She used to feel a relief in a few seconds. 

 
 

‘Whispering Hope’
 

I can recollect my western music teacher (Miss Trixie Dias Abeygunawardene who was a retired teacher from Sangamitta College, Galle), who passed away recently at the age of 91. During the final stages of her life she was in a luxurious Elders’ Home in Moratuwa. One day when I went to see her, she was all alone in her room looking at the bare walls and singing all by herself. She was singing the song “Whispering Hope” and she asked me to join in. She was lonely yet, she was happy.   

I felt so sorry that I tried not to cry in front of her. It was a Christian home for the elders and there was a piano in the sitting room, for anyone who wished to play. Later she refused to play it because she probably recollected how she taught her own pupils and trained the school choir, Day and Night (I too was in the choir).   

Even the practice of chanting pirith is done is such a way now that people without their knowledge listen to it, rather than listen to long sermons where the speaker preaches for hours.   

In some countries people use to do exercises rhythmically, so that they could avoid illnesses such as arthritis.   

Even some schools in Sri Lanka adopted this method (rhythmic exercises to music), especially early in the morning before classroom work commenced. It’s a variation for the children and they forget the stress caused by the unending learning process.   

I adopted this in the Advanced Level class during my English period. They were tired of listening to unending lectures throughout the day and sometimes brought stress upon them making them restless. There are some lessons included in the text book as motivational exercises. The children were singing together – songs like the famous ‘Titanic song’. They all love to sing that song, specially the boys, and they are happy to do the English lesson, thereafter.   

This is my own experience which I had very recently. I had to undergo surgery. That was my second operation. I am a Buddhist, but I have a Christian background. I sang Hymns when I was in the school (Southlands College, Galle) as a student.   

When I was taken to the operating Theatre, the only thing that came in to my mind was the crucifixion of Jesus Christ and the famous song – “Lord Jesus Christ you are all alone on the cross”. In a few seconds I was unconscious. I never knew what had happened. The pain relieved slowly after I gained consciousness. It was a miracle! 

Whenever I feel depressed I hum this song or play it on the piano. I forget all my aches and pains.   

The second surgical operation was done by the consultant surgeon, senior lecturer in surgery Dr. J.P.M. Kumarasinghe, who is attached to the Teaching Hospital in Karapitiya, Galle.   

I am grateful to both doctors. I must thank Dr. Krishantha Jayasekara, consultant physician – Base Hospital Balapitiya- for saving my life. I say this because when I was admitted to the hospital I was seriously ill. I hope, both of them, will be able to cure many more patients like me in future.   

All these are my life experiences. And I know that there is a therapeutic value in music. I don’t know whether your will agree with me or not. It is up to you to decide.   . (Retired teacher)
