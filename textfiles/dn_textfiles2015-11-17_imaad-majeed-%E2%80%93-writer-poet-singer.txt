IMAAD MAJEED – THE WRITER, POET & SINGER

Imaad Majeed is a musician who’s been performing in Colombo for the past several years. His style and music keeps changing and he’s bounced from journalism to advertising and now to writing food-reviews for YAMU, that is when he’s not strumming a guitar at The Melomanic Sessions or rapping for a live audience somewhere. With his fingers in a lot pies creatively speaking, we caught him for a quick Q & A session to hear him out.
Q: When and how did you start making music?
A: I was 15 years old, and I got a guitar from my parents – they also had a piano but I sucked at playing it. I started out with very ‘emo’ kind of music and just started writing lyrics to basic chords.
Q: You write poetry, you sing, you rap. Can you tell us a bit about how you experiment with form as an artist?
A: I find that lyrics in whatever genre, is poetry. There is stylized language, a set verse and all music comes out of this type of conversation. One rap song I worked on was about how I don’t like Ronald McDonald - it was a song about obesity. I like to use one form of expression that’s usually associated with a certain type of character, and flip it over unexpectedly. I’m also working on visual poetry now, where I post pictures on Facebook and ask for people’s comments – and I use their responses in my poetry.
Q: How easy or hard is it to be commercially successful as an artist, today in Sri Lanka?
A: It can be done if you’re lucky, and have the right networking and friends, and if you keep commitments. I’m not commercially successful. There is an industry that exists – if you work with it, and create a brand around your name, you can move forward. You need to sell out if you want to make it.
Q: You touch on some controversial topics in your music. You were once removed from the Good Market after a performance. Tell us more about those songs.
A: I started writing these kinds of songs after studying journalism in India, around the time that the BBS (a hardline hate-group in Sri Lanka) was getting more vocal. I was asked to perform at Good Market and someone thought the words in my rap song ‘Thambi Vamsa’ were racist and derogatory to Muslims. Another song called ‘Night Club Bauddhaya’ had the same effect – it name-dropped certain individuals known for frequenting night clubs in Sri Lanka, and one such individual’s sister had a stall at the Good Market, so I got kicked out for it.
Q: ‘Thambi Vamsa’ sounds pretty radical, what was it about?
A: I was inspired by music from the Beat Generation and by the rap-poet Krisantha Sri Bhagyadatta. Thambi Vamsa is a twist on the word ‘Mahavamsa’, and explores the origin of Muslims, how they areperceived and the clashes they’ve experienced – it was made more in response to events in Sri Lanka, than any statement made against anyone.
Q: How do you take on the criticism that you get?
A: I’m all ears to criticism. Someone asked me how to respond to haters – don’t think of them as haters, it’s important to listen, and learn how to more creatively express yourself and maybe change your work accordingly. However if someone is constantly striking you down, it’s important to have some self-respect and stand by your original work.
Q: Besides performing, you’re also a part of new creative movements, like Poetry P’lau. What has that been like?
A: Poetry P’lau was started by Krisantha Sri Bhagyadatta – it was initially just a handful of people meeting at his house to share their poetry. Today there are about 200-300 individuals interacting with the event, and about 20-30 people gathering for it at Hansa Café, every first Saturday of the month. I think it allows people a space to vent, by reading out their poetry. So that’s a kind of social commentary.
Q: Kacha Kacha is another event you curated – featuring a mash-up of very interesting new Sri Lankan artists. Tell us more about that.
A: Kacha Kacha was part of Radhika Hettiarachchi’s Cinnamon Colomboscope, and she wanted us to get trilingual, original material for it. We went with hip-hop, rap, poetry and baila blues. Buddhi de Mel is one artist at Kacha Kacha, whose code-switching between Sinhala and English is very interesting.
It was a great hit at Castle Hotel, where you got people who specially came for the event, and also the regulars at Castle Hotel, so we cover a wide range of people in the audience.
Q: You’ve tried your hand at a lot of things and you keep changing. What’s next for you? Will you be doing the same thing in ten years?
A: Well I’m not sure if I’ll still have this moustache in ten years! One long-term project that I plan on sticking to is the Annasi and Kadalagotu chapbook. The A&K literature festival, started by Elmo Jayawardene, is also a part of it – the event which involves local writers and artists is more accessible to everyone than other literary events here tend to be. We started the chapbook with 200 copies – it featured eight poets, and good, recent poetry. It’s crowd-funded now and is more sustainable and we’ve produced 400 copies, with the sixth edition coming up. The next one may be commissioned. So this is what I think I’ll still be working on in the future.
Q: You rap in Sinhala and English, have collaborated with artists who work in different languages. Do you feel language can be a barrier in Sri Lanka?
A: Languages are associated with different cultures. What’s more sensitive to one culture may be less for the other. For example it’s easier to talk about sex and transgender issues in English than in, say Tamil, because of the different cultures behind the languages. So there are interesting ways to approach these constraints considering different audiences and different cultural sensitivities. And the message delivered becomes different in every language. I think working around this conversation will help develop a more holistic Colombo/ Sri Lankan music scene.
Q: What advice would you give to young poets or musicians looking to start a career in Sri Lanka?
A: If I could go back in time, I would spend less time trying to get educated. I used to think that education and a degree is the only way to become something – even my family used to tell me that’s the only way I’d amount to anything. But there’s more to it than that. Choose to study something that’s going to help you – for example, if you’re a musician, study communication and then maybe you can apply yourself in TV and advertising. A long-shot would be if you could convince your parents to invest in creating a platform and connections, to start a series of events or workshops that can be monetized. Surround yourself with the right people, and make sure your interests are at the core of it all.
