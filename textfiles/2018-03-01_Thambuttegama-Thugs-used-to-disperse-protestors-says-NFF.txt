Thambuttegama: Thugs used to disperse protestors, says NFF


	

Thugs had been used to disperse the group of farmers, who protested at Thambuttegama yesterday against Government’s move to use water of the Rajanganaya Tank for a water supply project, National Freedom Front (NFF) Spokesman Mohammed Muzammil said today.

Addressing a news conference, he said the NFF condemned the attack on the protestors and added the Government should take action over using thugs along with Police personnel to disperse the protestors.

“It is natural that people become agitated against such moves by a Government. It is unfair to use water from the Rajanganaya Tank for a Water Supply project because a lot of farmers depend on the tank,” Muzammil said.

“It was clearly evident that protestors were beaten by individuals who were not Police personnel. It is absolutely undemocratic to disperse protestors in such manner. The Government should probe the incident closely,” Muzammil added.

Meanwhile, he said the Government announcement that the project had been suspended was not credible. 

He added the Government should announce clearly what its intentions were in such circumstances without temporarily suspending a project.  (Sheain Fernandopulle)
