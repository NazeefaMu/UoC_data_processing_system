A new dimension to buying votes


	



 

A group of candidates of a political party is said to be offering money in secret to people who make ‘a religious vow’ to vote for them.

 


Candidates generously distribute 500 and 1,000-rupee currency notes among these vow-takers in the hope that they will not go back on the pledge made tying it to their religious faith, they say.
