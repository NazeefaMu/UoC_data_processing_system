MYTH: Trimming your hair frequently makes it grow faster  

 

BUSTED: “This is a myth. Our hair cycle has three phases. There is a growing phase, a resting phase and finally the hair falls out. The resting phase is normally three months. That is a uniform thing. But the length of growing phase depends on each individual. It can vary from months to years and depending on how long this phase is, the length of the hair will also vary. It will grow until the end of the growing phase. By the time it falls out, there will be a new hair follicle growing in its place. By trimming, you can even the hair length and it can look cosmetically nicer but that doesn’t make your hair grow faster or longer.” explained
