Bank merger proposal dropped!


	


There is a bank launched by the previous regime for the sole purpose of uplifting the living of the poor in the country.
Quite recently a proposal that this bank be merged with the State-run savings bank came under the serious consideration of the yahapalanaya government. 
The proposed merger highly ruffled the purohita presiding over the subject of bringing prosperity to the poor because the move meant the transfer to the savings bank a massive Rs.50 billion fund held by the uplifting-the-poor bank currently functioning under his purview.
The purohita lost no time in getting an appointment to see the yahapalanaya boss to protest against the proposed merger and the latter after giving an attentive ear to the flustered purohita agreed not to go ahead with it. 
An elated purohita had gone laughing all the way back to his Ministry. However, another purohita had looked as if he had been slapped on the face when this news reached him.
