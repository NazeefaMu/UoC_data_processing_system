They all miss the charming girl


	

A charming girl who functioned as the coordinating secretary to a white-collar high-up at the august assembly has quit the job to take up a post in the administrative service. 

 


Employees say that they terribly miss the charming girl as she used to greet them all with utmost courtesy and a welcome smile whenever they had to call on the white-collar high-up on official matters.


They also complain that the girl’s successor is a grim-faced unsmiling person, a contrast to the charming girl.
