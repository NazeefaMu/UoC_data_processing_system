CB's Annual Report disclosed to media prior to Parliament: Bandula


	

Joint opposition MP Bandula Gunawardane yesterday alleged that the Finance Minister had disclosed the Central Bank's annual report to the media a week ago even before submitting it in parliament.

He said according to the Financial Laws Act, the report should be first submitted in Parliament, before disclosing it to any other institution.

"Although the report should have been presented in Parliament after it was submitted to the Finance Minister, it was only tabled in Parliament a week later. This is a bad precedent," the MP said.

The Speaker requested the Finance Minister to look into this issue and provide a copy of the report to the MPs. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)
