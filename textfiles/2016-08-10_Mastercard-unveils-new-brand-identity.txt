Mastercard, one of the world’s most recognizable brands, unveiled the evolution of its brand identity, including a modernized and simplified update to its iconic red and yellow logo coupled with a new look and feel for branded communications and experiences. 


The ability to thrive in a digital age, besides positioning Mastercard as a forward-thinking, human-centred technology company is fundamental to this change.
The digitization of commerce and increased connectivity of consumers is driving a digital transformation. This new brand identity is aimed to reflect readiness and optimism about this transformation. The new brand identity is simplified, modernized and optimized for an increasingly digital world. The brand identity starts with a new brand mark and plays out in a holistic design system that will stand for a forward-thinking, sophisticated and inclusive brand expression to every touch point around the world.


“Mastercard is one of those unique brands that is instantly recognizable around the world,” said Mastercard Chief Marketing and Communications Officer Raja Rajamannar.
“To thrive in this new digital world where business moves faster than ever, we wanted to modernize and elevate the brand identity through a design that is simple and elegant, yet unquestionably communicates Mastercard.”
The evolved brand identity, including the most comprehensive brand design system ever introduced globally within Mastercard, will be rolled out to all Mastercard products, communications and experiences, starting with Masterpass in July, and across Mastercard beginning in the fall.
