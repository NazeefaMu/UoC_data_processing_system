Family member wooed in the last ditch peace move


	



 

Another team of peace makers from the Betel leaf leadership has swung into action to make yet another bid to patch up the yawning differences among the party’s front-liners threatening to split the party right down the middle, behind–the-scene sources say.

 


The latest peace move comes in the form of a proposal to concede a key position in the party to a member of the former royal family. Even the highest authorities are in favour of the idea of offering a key position to a sibling recognized as a person who has rendered a remarkable service to the country. If the ongoing negotiations succeed, a former secretarial one too will soon be in luck’s way. 


The sibling who has won acceptance at the party’s highest level is likely to be offered high office in addition to the post of the senior deputy chairman of the party.
