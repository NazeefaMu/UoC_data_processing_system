What you need to know

 
Dr. Chrishan Jude Jayamaha (M.B., B.S. PG Dip in Med. Micro., M.D. (Med. Virology), a Consultant Virologist attached to the Department of Virology, Medical Research Institute (MRI) speaks about Zika virus infection, the latest disease reported from many Western countries in the world affecting many people, especially pregnant women and newborns.
Q – Zika virus is the current health issue in many countries. Why are we so concerned about it ?
A - The concern about this infection is mainly due to the relationship between Zika virus infections during pregnancy and observed increase in congenital (birth defects) malformations of the central nervous system among newborns (especially microcephaly- small head).

Q – How does the virus spread ?
A - Through mosquito bites. Zika virus is transmitted to people primarily through the bite of an infected Aedes species mosquito. These are the same mosquitoes that spread Dengue and Chikungunya.
Q – What are the symptoms of Zika virus infection ?
A - About one in five people infected with Zika virus become ill (develop Zika).The most common symptoms of Zika are fever, rash, joint pain, or conjunctivitis (red eyes). Other common symptoms include muscle pain and headache. The illness is usually mild with symptoms lasting for several days to a week. The incubation period (the time from exposure to symptoms) for Zika virus disease is not known, but is likely to be a few days to a week.
Q – How long will the disease last and how do doctors diagnose it ?
A - Zika virus usually remains in the blood of an infected person for a few days, but it can be found longer in some people. Severe disease requiring hospitalization is uncommon. Deaths are rare. The symptoms of Zika are similar to those of Dengue and Chikungunya.

Zika can be laboratory diagnosed by antibody developed against Zika virus, but cross reaction with Dengue and Chikungunya viruses can occur. Polymerase chain reaction PCR can be also used in early periods of the infection to confirm diagnosis.
Q – What are the treatments available at the moment?
A - No vaccine or medications are available to prevent or treat Zika infections. Doctors treat the symptoms. Affected patients need to get plenty of rest and drink fluids to prevent dehydration. They need to take paracetamol to relieve fever and pain.
