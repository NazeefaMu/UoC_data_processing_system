Special clinics to administer DT vaccine

The DT (Diphtheria and Tetanus) vaccine will be given to children above the age of five from next Friday under the direction of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne, a ministry spokesman said.
According to the spokesman, special clinics will be held countrywide on October 16. The DT vaccine will be brought to Sri Lanka from India on October 15. It will be distributed among state hospitals and administered to children at special clinics.
Some media reports revealed on October 11 that the vaccine was not available in Biyagama, Peliygoda, Kaduwela
and that health authorities in those areas do not administer the vaccine to the children above the age of five.
Minister Senaratne ordered health authorities to make available the vaccine countrywide as soon as possible and ensure that the National Immunization Programme continues smoothly without interruption.
