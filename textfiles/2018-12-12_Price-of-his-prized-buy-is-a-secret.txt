The purohita of ‘appochchi’ fame hailing from a distant district the other day paid an official visit to Austria.

 


The two-day seminar he attended over, he had headed for the neighbouring country, Switzerland instead of getting back home. 


After checking into a five-star hotel in Switzerland, he had lost no time going around the Swiss wristwatch shops along with a friend.


It was, in fact, in a bid to realize a life-long cherished dream that he had gone on this shopping spree; to buy a Rolex wristwatch from a shop in the country of its origin!


So, he had at the end of the day bought the prized wristwatch. However, he has decided to keep its price a dead secret, they say.
