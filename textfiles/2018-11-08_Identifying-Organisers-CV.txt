Former Northern Province Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran said yesterday that he was in the process of identifying electoral organizers of his party at the moment.

Mr Wigneswaran told the Daily Mirror that he tendered his resignation to the Ilankai Tamil Arasu Katchi (ITAK) on October 24, 2018.

He said he was slowly taking steps for the registration of his party named Tamil Makkal Kootani (IMK).

“I do not know whether they have accepted my resignation,” he said. (Kelum Bandara)
