The Government would allow only one protest a week in Colombo soon, a top official said.   

The Government also would impose new laws to stop hindrances caused by public protests held daily in the Colombo City.  

“The Government is also focusing on a plan to restrict the protests to one a week, until laws are formulated,” an official said.  

“The Government has decided on new laws after SLFP and UNP Parliamentarians and other Government MPs met Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe at the Parliament complex and requested to take measures to minimise the inconveniences caused to people due to protests being held daily in Colombo,” the official said.  

The Prime Minister is expected to hold special discussion with the heads of Security Forces this week to discuss the matter raised by the MPs, it is learnt.( Anjula Mahika Weerarathna)
