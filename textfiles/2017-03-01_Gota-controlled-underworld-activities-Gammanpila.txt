The Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) yesterday charged that there should be brave leaders like former defence secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa to control the underworld activities.

PHU General Secretary MP Udaya Gammanpila told a media briefing that the underworld activities have now been awaken again during the past two years, unlike in the period of the former government.

“The underworld activities are usually carried out in any country with the assistance of a political aide. The situation is also the same in Sri Lanka. But during the former government the incidents of underworld activities were rare since Mr. Rajapaksa has handled them in a politically unbiased manner,” he said. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)
