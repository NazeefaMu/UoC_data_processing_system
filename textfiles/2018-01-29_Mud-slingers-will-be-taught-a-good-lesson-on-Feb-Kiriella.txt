Mud-slingers will be taught a good lesson on Feb.10: Kiriella


	

Minister Lakshman Kiriella said UNP supporters would teach political mud-slingers a good lesson on February 10.

Addressing a Local government election rally in Kandy, he said some people presumed they could defeat the UNP over the bond matter .

“Our opponents should realise that the UNP is a political party with a strong foundation and a strong leadership. The Opposition requested a debate on the bond report and it was granted. Although Prime Minister wished to address the debate, the joint opposition and the JVP disturbed him. They argued how could they debate without having the bond report. At that point I asked them why they requested for a debate," the minister said.

He said the fullest support should be given to the Prime Minister at this decisive local government election by electing UNP candidates to the local bodies. "There is no doubt that we will be able to have a UNP president next time, if we win the local bodies at this election," the minister said.

He said the Central Expressway was launched and was now progressing. "We are sure it will be inaugurated in August 2020 and and when in operation will take only one hour to reach Colombo from Kandy. It is a given that the development of Kandy District depends on the Central Expressway.

The minister said a Free Trade Zone will be set up in Galagedera and that several such development projects would be launched in the Kandy District on the instructions of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
