President Maithripala Sirisena further consolidated his position in the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) when the party’s Central Committee entrusted him the power to decide on the nomination of members to the posts of Opposition Leader, Deputy Speaker and Chief Opposition Whip.
The SLFP Central Committee met at his residence yesterday to discuss the way forward for the party and to endorse the party’s decision to take up positions in the proposed National Unity Government.
According to party sources, the President was also given the authority to decide on the nomination of MPs elect for ministerial posts in the government. The party discussed in detail its decision to be part of the national government for two years.
Already, the SLFP has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the United National Party (UNP) to form the National Unity Government, primarily to boost the economic growth, to introduce a new Constitution and to evolve a new electoral system.
The UNP will take up 33 Cabinet posts and the SLFP 12 posts in the government. SLFP members will hold portfolios such as agriculture, transportation, higher education , irrigation and Samurdhi Development.
Alongside, the party appointed a committee to assess the situation and to make recommendations for reforming it politically. It comprises SLFP General Secretary Duminda Dissanayake, MPs Mahinda Amaraweera, Ranjith Siyambalapitiya and former MP Jagath Pushpakumara.
Meanwhile, the SLFP will hold its 64th Anniversary in Polonnaruwa on September 2 coinciding with the President’s birthday.(Kelum Bandara)
