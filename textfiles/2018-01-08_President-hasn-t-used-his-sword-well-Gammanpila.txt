President Maithripala Sirisena had not used his sword well to trap the real culprits of bond scam, General Secretary of Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU), MP Udaya Gammanpila said today.

Some party members of PHU including Udaya Gammanpila, Madumadawa Aravinda and Dammika Rathmale were seen today at the media briefing wearing clothes in black and carrying a sword in their hands.

Addressing a media briefing, he said if President Sirisena had used his sword well, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe would have been a convict of the bonds scam that took place in 2015.

“Not only the Premier but also former Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake should have been trapped for the bribery allegations and Industry and Commerce Minister Rishad Bathiudeen would have been alleged for illegal deforestation. Still we see these crooks are at large. Thus, we insist the President to take instant actions against the said individuals and further look into the complaints that the Joint Opposition has made to the Bribery Commission under the 'Top-Ten thieves of the Yahapalanaya Government',” MP Gammanpila said.

He further said President Sirisena must take steps to make the Bond report available for people to have access in all the three languages. (Sheain Fernandopulle)
