Was it by design or by accident?


	



 

The former strongman visited the country of the Rising Sun recently and was given a red carpet welcome by the compatriot community there. And by a strange coincidence, soon afterwards he found himself in the company of a yahapalanaya deputy who was to remain his inseparable companion until the end of his visit in that hospitable country. 

 


The deputy is said to be a Blue one hailing from the Puttalam district and he was in the council even during the regime of the former strongman.  


By the way, a rumour was abuzz in the recent past that this worthy was on the verge of joining the JO, the current political vehicle of the former strongman. However, it did not happen. There was another rumour later that he had had second thoughts about the contemplated move considering the possible outcome of several pending court cases against him. 


However, the question as to why our man had obviously planned to go about in a foreign country in tow with the former strongman still remains unanswered, they say.
