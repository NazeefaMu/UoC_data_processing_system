Havies-Kandy game should be a thriller

 
The confrontation between two unbeaten clubs Kandy Sports Club and Havelocks Sports club in the Dialog 'A' Division inter-club league rugby first round match at Havelock Park today should turn out to be a thriller. The match will kick off at 6:30 pm under lights.
Havelocks who had a close game against Police in their first outing came back to their normal pattern of play to be unbeaten so far along with Kandy. Havies have been training hard during the last few days and are determined to pull off a morale-boosting win.
Kandy on the hand registered run away victories against CH and FC, Air Force, Police, Army and had a close call 22-16 win against the fighting CR and FC unit in their last outing will have to be at their very best if they are to beat the high riding Havies in their own den at Havelock Park.
Going by the two team's performances so far a close tussle for supremacy can be expected.
The forte of Havelocks team has been their power-packed forwards. The Havies 'eight' especially Ganuka Dissanayaka, Prasad Madusanka, Dushmantha Priyadarshana, Janik Jayasuriya and Sudarshana Muthuthanthri have given a terrific display in the loose but today they will be given a torrid time by the Kandy forwards spearheaded by burly Heshan Kalhara and ably supported by Soyuru Anthony, Kishore Jehan, Damith Dissanayaka, Piyumal Manchanayaka and Gayan Ratnayaka.
In the set scrums the experienced Havelocks hooker Prasad Madusanka should get the better of his vis-a-vis Damith Dissanayaka while the line outs should be shared between the Havies duo of Jayasuriya and Muthuthanthri and Kandy's Anthony and Ratnayaka.
With the halves combination of Rahul de Silva and Rimzie Jamaldeen having clicked in the last few matches Havelocks will hope that Rahul will set his three quarters in motion at every turn as they have two hard running centres in Hirantha Perera and Nishon Perera. In addition they have two experienced wingers in captain Sadun Herath and Randitha Warnapura who have stood out with their powerful runs down the flank with full back Kevin Dixon often joining the line to form the overlap.
Teams:
Kandy SC : Piyumal Manchanayaka, Damith Disanayaka, Kishore Jehan, Shehan Dimitri, Gayan Ratnayaka, Heshan Kalhara, Shehan Pathirana, Buwaneka Udangamuwa, Roshan Weeraratna or Srinath Sooriyabandara and Fazil Marija (Captain), Dansha Dayan, Gayan Weeraratna, Lavanga Perera, Vishvamithra Jayasinghe, Nigel Ratwatte
