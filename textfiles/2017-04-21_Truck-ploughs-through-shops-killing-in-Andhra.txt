At least 20 people died and 10 others were injured after a truck ploughed through commercial roadside shops at Yerpedu village in Chittoor district in Andhra Pradesh today, the Times of India reported.

According to cops, the driver lost control of his vehicle and initially rammed into a car first and then hit an electricity pole before bulldozing through the shops. Both the bodies and the injured victims were shifted to the government and other hospitals in Tirupati and Srikalahasti in Chittoor district.

Hospital sources suggest that the toll is likely to go up since some of the injured are in critical condition.

Meanwhile, Rs five lakh ex-gratia was announced by the state cabinet and CM directed both ministers - P Narayana and N Amarnath Reddy - to leave the cabinet meeting and reach the spot to support the victims.

Minister for Health Kamineni Srinivas directed the district collectors to extend all support to the victims and provide top medical treatment for the injured. He also ordered the post-mortem of the victims to take place immediately and hand them over to their respective families. The CM also directed the state administration to deploy workers to fasten up the rescue operations.
