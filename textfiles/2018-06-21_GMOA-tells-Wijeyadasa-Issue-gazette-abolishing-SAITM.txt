The Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) today requested Higher Education Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe to issue a gazette notification abolishing SAITM.

GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge told a news conference that the gazette notification should be issued in keeping with the Universities Act.

“We urge the minister to issue the gazette notification as assured in order to solve the nine-year long issue. The observations of the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) should be put forward to solve this issue in a more fruitful manner. The latest stance on SAITM to absorb its students to General Sir John Kotelawala Defence University (KDU) should be followed by the recommendations of the SLMC. A timeframe should be introduced to end the absorbing of SAITM students to KDU. The additional training which is supposed to be given to these students should be followed by a study on it. The entry qualification should be decided with the observations of the SLMC. The minimum standards for medical education should be gazetted to avoid any confusion in future. Unlike other leaders, President Maithripala Sirisena has addressed this issue in a fair manner,” he said. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)
