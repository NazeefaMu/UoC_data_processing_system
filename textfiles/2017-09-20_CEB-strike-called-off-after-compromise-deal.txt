The Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) Workers' Union whose strike went on for a week, had been called off a short while ago, Secretary Ranjan Jayalal said.

He said the TUs had been able to reach a compromise with the authorities leading to a win-win situation for both sides.

Mr. Jayalal told Daily Mirror that they had got written confirmation from the government that the TU demands would all be met. He said the government had promised to resolve the situation surrounding the salary anomalies of CEB employees as well.

Meanwhile, Power and Renewable Energy Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya, addressing a press conference today, thanked all the relevant authorities including Labour and Trade Union Relations Minister W. D. J Seneviratne for coming together to find a justifiable solution for all. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
