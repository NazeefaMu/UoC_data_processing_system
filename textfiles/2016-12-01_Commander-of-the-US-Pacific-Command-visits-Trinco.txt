The Commander of the US Pacific Command Admiral Harry B Harris who was on an official visit to Sri Lanka to attend the Galle Dialogue 2016, took time off to visit the Naval Base, Trincomalee.

The US Admiral was warmly received by Commander Eastern Naval Area, Rear Admiral Travis Sinniah and the visiting delegation was made aware on the operational function of the Eastern Naval Command.

During this tour Admiral Harris got onboard SLNS Samudura and shared a light moment with the Commanding Officer and ship’s crew. He also visited sites where US military personnel have continued to train with the Sri Lanka Navy on skills such as disaster assistance and underwater demining and met with members of the newly-established Sri Lanka Navy Marines, who worked with the US 11th Marines Expeditionary Unit and the crew of the visiting USS Somerset.
