Set of guidelines for teaching hospitals in the pipeline - Rajitha
A set of guidelines that applies to teaching hospitals is being formulated, Health and Indigenous Medicine Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said in Parliament yesterday.
He was responding to a question raised by Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake under the Standing Order 23 (2) asking the government to explain its stance on the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) in Malabe.
Dissanayake observed that the SAITM is being operated without a proper legal approval and added that it is not accredited by the Sri Lanka Medical Council.
"The SAITM was recognised as a degree awarding institute by the gazettes issued by the former Higher Education Minister in 2011 and 2013.
This was an arbitrary decision.
The SAITM claims Nevil Fernando hospital as a teaching hospital, but it is not properly recognised.
Over 1,000 students have enrolled at this institute so far. Each student pays about Rs. 12 million for an MBBS. The SAITM is deceiving the parents and students," he pointed out.
The minister responding to the statement said neither the UGC nor the Higher Education Ministry has so far developed any laws pertaining to teaching hospitals.
"Therefore we are now in the process of forming regulations pertaining to them. This is done to maintain the standards in them. Even though the SAITM claims its hospital as a teaching hospital, it is not registered in the Private Hospital Registration Act as a teaching hospital.
The Medical Council has pointed out the shortcomings in the Clinical services relating to the SAITM, and it must rectify them to be qualified.
We will support it to improve its standards on the forensic medical and public health aspects as those areas need the government's help," he commented.
Government aims third generation economic plan - Prime Minister
Prime Minister Ranil Wcirkemesinghe told Parliament yesterday that the new government's aim is to present third generation economic plan to rescue the country from an economic abyss and develop it further.
"Our economy is in bad shape today due to economic mismanagement of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa's government.
Therefore, we must implement a long term programme to make Sri Lanka an import and export hub like in the early days," he said.
The Prime Minister was speaking during the presentation of the government's medium plan economic policy in parliament yesterday.
He said former President J. R. Jayewardene introduced social and economic reforms under the first generation economic plan to develop the country while many social and economic reforms were introduced under the second generation economic plan by former President R. Premadasa.
"In presenting the third generation economic plan, under the President Maithripala Sirisena's regime we will look at increasing the income level of people, creating 100,000 new job opportunities, improving rural economy while creating strong and wide middle class in the country. We will also pay attention to create a competitive trade economy based on the knowledge based society and extending investment opportunities looking at global economic conditions.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe made one hour presentation on the present government's medium plan economic policy from 1.55 p.m. to 2.55 p.m.
Dinesh leaves Chamber protesting against Finance Minister
MEP Leader and UPFA MP Dinesh Gunawardena left the Chamber yesterday protesting against Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayaka's move to present an order under the Excise (Special Provisions) Act and several resolutions under the Customs Ordinance and Excise Ordinance in Parliament.
Along with MP Gunawardene, MP Bandula Gunawardena and MP Chandrasiri Gajadeera and several UPFA backbenchers followed suit and abstained from participating in the debate.
Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake, UPFA MP Bandula Gunawardena, and Dinesh Gunawardena when the time came for the notice of motions and orders of the day spoke against the government taking up the Order and Resolutions for debate pointing out that more than three months had lapsed since their introduction to parliament. The Order and Resolutions should have been taken for debate within four months, they pointed out citing Standing Orders and presenting them now is unlawful. The wrong procedure has been followed in presenting these orders and resolutions.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said that he also realised there is something wrong with this arrangement. "That is why I asked the opinions of the Attorney General in this regard.
Then, Speaker informed the House that the Attorney General had informed him that the Order and Resolutions could be taken up for debate and there was no legal barrier. However, MP Gunawardena said that it was illegal to take the Order and Resolutions for debate and walked out of the Chamber.
