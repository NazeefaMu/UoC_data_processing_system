Emmanuel Macron taking a parting shot at Donald Trump and said it is ‘insane’ the US is pulling out of international treaties while predicting the President would kill the Iran deal.   


The French leader said Trump would get out of the nuclear agreement next month for ‘domestic reasons’ and accused the US of short-termism by withdrawing from treaties it had only just joined.   
His comments on Wednesday come towards the end of a three-day state visit which saw Macron and Trump lavish each other with compliments and heap praise the warm relationship between their two countries.   


‘My view — I don’t know what your president will decide — is that he will get rid of this deal on his own, for domestic reasons,’ Macron told around a dozen reporters at George Washington University.   
When pressed again on whether Trump would ditch the deal, Macron replied: ‘I think so. That’s my view. I don’t have any specific information, I’m not an insider. My view is that there is a big risk he will leave.’   


And on Trump’s tendency to pull out of international treaties, the French leader said: ‘It can work in the short term but it’s very insane in the medium to long term,’ he said of the US decision ‘to change [its] opposition so often.’   


Trump - a fierce opponent of the July 2015 agreement signed by Tehran and international powers - must declare by May 12 if he will walk away from the existing deal .
