Failed diplomacy?


	



 

A Colombo-based envoy of a powerful Western country met the professor leading the Pohottuwa party at a high-society party held in the city recently.

 


Their conversation gradually turned to the political developments in the country and the envoy suggested it was high time that former strongman quit politics for a quiet life in retirement. 


The professor who did not take kindly to this unexpected suggestion replied: “It is the people in the country who do not want him to go into retirement. How can he turn his back on the popular demand?”
The envoy was not impressed with the excuse trotted out by the professor. “The son of your former boss will have a promising political future only if he retires – fades completely from the political scene. Therefore, he should quit at least in the interest of his own son!”


Annoyed by the envoy’s persistence, the professor put an end to the argument saying: “As I told you, it is the masses who want our boss to continue to play an active role in politics. I invite you to watch the crowd enthusiasm at two or three public functions he attends. Let us   resume discussion on this matter thereafter!”
