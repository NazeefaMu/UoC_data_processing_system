AG re-indicts Basil


	

The Attorney General, in the Colombo High Court, today re-indicted former minister Basil Rajapaksa and Divineguma Department’s former director general Kithsiri Ranawaka on charges of misappropriating Rs.29 million belonging to the Divineguma.

The indictments originally filed in Court on Mr. Rajapaksa and Mr. Ranawaka were yesterday withdrawn by the AG on the basis that it had contained some technical errors which needed to be rectified.

The money had been reportedly used to print and distribute almanacs with the photographs of then presidential candidate Mahinda Rajapaksa.

In the wake of the withdrawal of the indictments Colombo High Court Judge Pathmini N. Ranawaka yesterday discharged Mr. Rajapaksa and Mr. Ranawake from the case filed against them.

The prosecuting counsel said the indictments had been originally served without the AG’s ‘consent letter’. (Shehan Chamika Silva)
