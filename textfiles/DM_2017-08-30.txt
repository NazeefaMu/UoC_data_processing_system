Abortion is not a human right - Cardinal
	
Abortion cannot be considered as a human right as claimed by some, Archbishop of Colombo Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith said over the weekend.
Some claim that abortion is a human right. Right to kill is not a human right. Human rights are there to save lives not to end them, cardinal said at a service in Thewatte Basilica on Sunday.
 Even the previous government tied to ease the abortion laws and now we here that this government is also out to do the same. Catholic Bishops Conference which issued a statement on the matter has been criticized by some, he added.
Cardinal Ranjith said all children are born according to Gods will and no one is born outside his will. He said even those who are differently-abled keep their parents together and play a role in ensuring well-being of their families.

Celebrating the birth anniversary of a great educator
	
147th Birth anniversary of Dr. Maria Montessori
The 147th birth anniversary of Dr. Maria Montessori- one of the greatest educators of the 19th century--will be celebrated tomorrow by the Good Shepherd Maria Montessori Training Centre in Colombo. 
To mark the event, a holy mass will be held at St. Bridgets Convent Chapel at 2 pm. The celebrant will be Rev. Fr. K. D. Anthony Lakshman, staff member of St. Sebastians College Moratuwa. 
Born on August 31, 1870 in the town of Chiaravalle in Italy, Maria Montessoris father, Alessandro, was an accountant in the civil service, and her mother, Renilde Stoppani, was well educated and had a passion for reading. 
The Montessori family moved to Rome in 1870 and in 1871 the young Montessori girl enrolled in the local state school. Breaking conventional barriers from the beginning of her education, Maria initially had aspirations to become an engineer. 
When Maria Montessori graduated secondary school, she became determined to enter medical school and become a doctor. Despite her parents encouragement to enter teaching, Maria wanted to enter the male-dominated sphere of medicine. After initially being refused entry, Maria was eventually given entry to the University of Rome in 1890, becoming the first woman to enter medical school in Italy. Despite facing many obstacles due to her gender, Montessori qualified as a doctor in July 1896. 

Soon after her medical career began, Dr. Montessori became involved in the Womens Rights movement. She became known for her high levels of competency in treating patients, but also for the respect she showed to patients from all social classes. In 1897, Dr Montessori joined a research programme at the psychiatric clinic of the University of Rome, as a volunteer. This work initiated a deep interest in the needs of children with learning disabilities. 
At the age of twenty-eight Montessori began advocating her controversial theory that the lack of support for mentally and developmentally disabled children was the cause of their delinquency. The notion of social reform became a strong theme throughout Marias life, whether it was for gender roles, or advocacy for children. 
In 1901 Montessori began her own studies of education philosophy and anthropology, lecturing and teaching students. In this period, the development of Rome meant that children were left at home as their parents worked. The number of children needing a guide and role model presented Maria with an opportunity to work with children with normal development and push her ideas into the mainstream. Dr Montessori opening her Casa dei Bambini in Rome, in1907 bringing some of the educational materials she had developed at the Orthophrenic School. 
Dr. Montessori put many different activities and other materials into the childrens environment but kept only those that engaged them. What she came to realise was that children who were placed in an environment where activities were designed to support their natural development had the power to educate themselves. By 1909 Dr Montessori gave her first training course in her new approach to around 100 students. Her notes from this period provided the material for her first book published that same year in Italy, appearing in translation in the United States in 1912 as The Montessori Method, and later translated into 20 languages. 
A period of great expansion in the Montessori approach now followed. Montessori societies, training programmes and schools sprang to life all over the world, and a period of travel with public speaking and lecturing occupied Dr Montessori, much of it in America, but also in the UK and throughout Europe. 

"To mark the 147th birth anniversary of Dr. Maria Montessori, a holy mass will be held at St. Bridgets Convent Chapel at 2 pm. on August 31."
Having long held the ambition to create her own permanent, long-standing centre for research and development. Montessori was held back by the rise of fascism in Europe. Montessori schools were closed by Nazis and both books and effigies were burned. In 1939, Maria and her son Mario moved to India to lecture, initially intending to travel for only three months, the trip lasted seven years, as the outbreak of war, saw Mario was interned and Maria put under house arrest, as Italian citizens. In India, Maria trained over a thousand Indian Teachers. Returning to Europe, Maria addressed UNESCO in 1947 with the theme of Education and Peace and ultimately receiving her nomination for Nobel Peace Prize in 1949. 
Dr. Montessoris visit to India was important to Sri Lanka as well as she visited Sri Lanka in 1944 to introduce her method of early childhood education, the AMI method of educating children.


Having completed a Training Course in India, on the invitation of the Ceylon Teachers Association Dr. Maria and her son arrived here to conduct the first ever training course in Sri Lanka. The training was conducted at Good Shepherd Convent, Kotahena, Colombo 13 and there were more than 300 participants including principals of schools, teachers, university lecturers and training colleges, young students from schools, mothers interested in helping their children and many Good Shepherd Sisters, who later opened childrens houses in the convents in different parts of the island. 
With the vision to communicate an understanding of education as a help to life, nurtured by love, compassion, patience, care and commitment to the needs of little children the world over, practicing the principles of Dr. Maria Montessoris method of Education, today the congregation of Good Shepherd religious nuns runs the Good Shepherd Maria Montessori Training Centre at St. Bridgets Convent, 85, C.W.W. Kannangara Mawatha, Colombo 07.

Charges against Gen. Jayasuriya false: Military
	
Military Spokesman Roshan Seneviratne today rejected the war crime charges levelled against former General Jagath Jayasuriya who served as the Ambassador to Brazil.
Responding to a journalist at the Cabinet news briefing, the Brigadier said baseless allegations had been made against military personnel since the end of the war in 2009.
The recent lawsuit filed against the former General validates that the LTTE ideology still prevails though it was defeated on the soil, he said.
Meanwhile, Cabinet Spokesman and Minister Rajitha Senaratne said they would continue to take legal action against specific allegations levelled against military personnel based on the evidence.
However, not all killings and everything happened during the war are violations of human rights, he said.

Dance not to the tune of dengue!
	
The threat of yet another outbreak looms large
Despite the recent drop in the number of dengue cases being reported, the threat of dengue is not over yet. The truth is that there still remains a strong possibility of yet another outbreak of dengue looming round the corner with the next inter-monsoon and North East monsoon scheduled to commence in October and December respectively. Therefore, the public has a tremendous role to play in ensuring that preventive measures- carried out during the recent outbreak of dengue- are continued with more effective into the future as well. 
It wasnt long ago that many hospitals witnessed a difficult situation when they tried to accommodate the increasing number of dengue patients in hospital wards, that were already crowded beyond capacity. As the situation worsened with the increasing number of dengue patients admitted for treatment, many hospitals were compelled to make arrangements for temporary wards that could accommodate more patients. According to statistics at the Epidemiology Unit, a staggering 40, 625 dengue cases were recorded for the month of July alone, which is also the highest record for this year. It should also be noted that 144, 052 dengue cases have been reported since January this year. 
However, health officials who spoke to The Daily Mirror commented that they have observed an improvement in this trend since the number of dengue patients being admitted to hospitals have reduced significantly. The number of patients has dropped to 16, 481 in the month of August. 

"There are two types of mosquitoes that transmit the dengue virus, namely Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus"

Preventive measures need to be carried out rigorously

Speaking to the Daily Mirror, Assistant Secretary of the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) Dr. Haritha Aluthge noted that the dengue epidemic is currently subsiding countrywide. He said that as far as the hospital set up is concerned, most of the wards, which were temporarily set up, are now being closed. Therefore, he said that the dengue situation is comparatively getting less challenging than earlier. However, he warned that the latest outcome, with regard to dengue, shouldnt be taken for granted. He explained that this is mainly because the next peak season regarding dengue would commence in December with the onset of the monsoon rains. Therefore, he said that the cleaning up operations need to be continued with as usual and done
more rigorously. 
The Ministry of Health needs to be alerted, so that it can continue with the cleaning up operations and the preventive measures against dengue. What really happens is that the authorities take preventive measures against curbing dengue only when the epidemic is increasing. Its important to continue with these measures routinely until dengue starts peaking in December /January. If not so, we will experience a similar situation where an increased number of dengue cases will be reported again. 
Currently, the cases being reported are clearly reducing, especially in Colombo and Gampaha where a high number of dengue cases were reported. Even the wards at the National Hospital were closed down following the decrease in the number of patients. This also includes the Infectious Diseases Hospital and other peripheral stations where the temporary wards have been closed down. However, its crucial to carry on with the preventive measure without failure in order to keep the epidemic at bay, Dr. Aluthge added. 
	Activities such as garbage segregation and proper disposal and the cleaning of the surrounding environment shouldnt be stopped simply because the case load is decreasing
	
	
	The most prevalent mosquito type during the last few months was the Aedes aegypti
	
	
	Currently, the cases being reported are clearly reducing, especially in Colombo and Gampaha
	

"We have identified high risk Grama Niladhari (GN) locations within the MoH areas"

Fourteen high-risk districts identifiedto date
According to the Consultant Community Physician attached to the National Dengue Control Unit Dr. Prachila Samaraweera, currently there is a significant reduction in the number of patients being reported on, with cases dropping to sixty percent. We have still identified fourteen high risk districts which include, Colombo, Gampaha, Kalutara, Galle, Matara, Ratnapura, Kegalle, Kandy, Matale, Jaffna, Trincomalee, Batticaloa, Vavuniya and Kalmunai. With the onset of the North East monsoon, the Northern and East Provinces will be faced with the high risk of spreading dengue. We have declared the second, National Mosquito Prevention Week from September 20  26 covering all MoH areas of the country. We have identified high risk Grama Niladhari (GN) locations within the MoH areas. We are planning to cover all premises that fall within the purview of these GN Divisions. Routine inspection, identification and removal of dengue mosquito breeding grounds, pest control, health education and taking legal action against those who dont maintain their surrounding environments clean will be the focus during this programme,Dr. Samaraweera said. 
Accordingly, she said that the Presidential Task Force, including all the ministries that fall under its purview, Public Health Inspectors, the Tri Forces, the Police, local authorities, the Ministry of Health and the public, together will have to cooperate and work together in order to make the National Mosquito Prevention Week a success. While acknowledging that the number of patients in hospitals is reducing, she also noted that the current weather pattern and the garbage collection procedures practiced at present have contributed to this, to a certain extent. We should bear in mind that there could be an outbreak anytime. Therefore, we cant stop the activities we have commenced. Activities such as garbage segregation and proper disposal and the cleaning of the surrounding environment shouldnt be stopped simply because the case load is decreasing, Dr. Samaraweera said. She said that in the recent past, the public and the media had extended support to help control the outbreak. She emphasized on the need to keep up with the good work in future as well. 

"We have declared the second, National Mosquito Prevention Week from September 20  26 covering all MoH areas of the country"
Source reduction; the ultimate goal of removing mosquito breeding sites
When inquired about the current situation of the hospital, which was full of dengue patients, Consultant Physician of the Infectious Diseases Hospital (IDH) Dr. Ananda Wijewickrama said that the number of cases has reduced significantly. He stated that this is the result of the combination of efforts put together by the Ministry of Health with the involvement of all media groups, Government and Non-Government organizations and the general public. However, Dr. Wijewickrama said that people shouldnt be complacent regarding this situation because after the October monsoon, a rise in the number of dengue cases is expected. Unless we carry on these preventive programmes and continuously stress on the need to do so, a situation similar to what happened in June and July could repeat in December. If we continue to focus on source reduction, especially on the removal of mosquito breeding sites, we can reduce the risk of dengue spreading to a great extent. There are two types of mosquitoes that transmit the dengue virus, namely Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. 
Since mosquito breeding sites increased alarmingly this time, the number of mosquito larvae found in many places also increased rapidly. This situation was mostly witnessed inside houses. The most prevalent mosquito type during the last few months was the Aedes aegypti which is a household mosquito that breeds around or inside residences. That is why we receive many cases where patients are from the same family. Therefore, it is a public responsibility to keep their houses devoid of mosquito breeding sites. Keeping the surrounding environment clean should also be done as a regular habit rather than doing it as a preventive measure when there is an outbreak, Dr. Wijewickrama concluded.  

"According to statistics at the Epidemiology Unit, a staggering 40, 625 dengue cases were recorded for the month of July alone, which is also the highest record for this year"

First to do the somersault ahead of polls
	

There is widespread speculation in political circles that a Green party Diyawanna member from Pulasthipura, a namesake of a well-known electorate in Sabaragamuwa is about to quit his council seat to come forward as the Betel leaf chief purohita candidate at the upcoming provincial polls.

The Green party leaders had already instituted inquiries in this connection, they say.
The Green party Diyawanna member has already given an assurance to the Betel leaf leadership that he is in a position to easily take the NCPC if he were appointed as the partys Polonnaruwa district leader with the exclusive right to pick the group of candidates to be fielded on the partys district list. He is yet to receive the green light from above, they say.

Fitch affirms Citibank Lankan branch at AAA(lka)
	
Fitch Ratings Lanka has affirmed the Citibank N.A. Colombo branchs (CitiSL) national long-term rating at AAA(lka).The Outlook is Stable.
CitiSLs rating reflects the credit profile and financial strength of Citibank N.A. The rating is linked with Citibank N.A.s IDR to reflect CitiSLs legal status as a branch ofCitibank N.A., which makes it part of the same legal entity. It also reflects the relatively smallsize of the branch (less than one percent of the total assets of Citibank, N.A.) and therefore, any supportwould not be material to the head office.
Citibank N.A.s rating is higher than Sri Lankas Long-Term Localand ForeignCurrency IDRs ofB+/Stable and as a result, CitiSLs rating is at the highest end of the national rating scale forSri Lanka. Fitch believes that support from Citibank N.A. would be forthcoming if required,subject to any regulatory constraints on remitting money into Sri Lanka. CitiSL is operationally integrated with Citigroup through the use of common systems and regularreporting. Its strategic objectives are also aligned with those of the group. CitiSLs stringent credit evaluation framework has helped the branch maintain sound assetquality with zero non-performing loans since 2009. However, it has also led to a highlyconcentrated loan book, with the top 20 largest loans accounting for 97.0 percent of total lending atend-1H17.
Fitch expects the branch to maintain sufficient capitalisation to support its business plansdespite regular profit repatriations. CitiSLs Fitch Core Capital ratio remained high at 34.6 percent atend-June 2017,although it declined from the 44.5 percent at end-2016 due to aggressive loan growthin 1H17. CitiSLs highly concentrated deposit base declined to 76.3 percent of the branchs funding mix at end-1H17 from 85.6 percent at end-2015, due to an increase in inter-branch borrowings. However, Fitchbelieves that CitiSLs liquidity position is stable as the branch has access to intergroup funding, if needed.

Fitch assigns Siyapatha finances subordinated debt final BBB+(lka)
	
Fitch Ratings Lanka has assigned Siyapatha Finance PLCs subordinated redeemable debentures of up to LKR one billion a final national long-term rating of BBB+(lka).
The assignment of the final rating follows the receipt of final documents that conform toinformation previously received. The final rating is at the same level as the expected ratingassigned on 21 July 2017.
The debentures will have a five-year tenor with bullet principal repayment at maturity. Coupon payments will be made annually at a fixed rate. The debentures will be listed on the Colombo Stock Exchange. Siyapatha expects to use the proceeds to strengthen its regulatory Tier 2 capital and to fund its loan book. The debentures are rated one notch below Siyapathas National long-term rating to reflect their subordination to senior unsecured creditors.
Siyapathas National long-term rating was last affirmed at A-(lka) with a Negative Outlook on21 July 2017. Siyapathas rating reflects Fitchs view that support would be forthcoming from itsparent, Sampath Bank PLC (A+(lka)/Negative), which owns 100 percent of Siyapatha and is involved inthe strategic direction of Siyapatha through board representation. Siyapatha is rated twonotches below its parent because of Siyapathas limited contribution to the groups corebusinesses; the group leasing book accounted for just seven percent of group advances at end-2016, ofwhich Siyapatha provided 42 percent.

Forewarned, they are forearmed
	

A group of yahapalanaya dissidents at purohita level had held a powwow behind locked doors at an official residence in the Nawala area the other day.

They had met mainly for the purpose of discussing a warning issued by a yahapalanaya big gun carrying secretarial status that the defectors should be prepared to face inevitable court cases against them.
After lengthy deliberations, they had arrived at a decision regarding how they should face such an eventuality, informed sources say.
Several senior purohitas from Colombo, Wayamba and Sabaragamuwa areas had been among those present at the powwow.
A senior purohita from the Colombo district who once held secretarial status had warned his colleagues that if they continued to remain in the yahapalanaya they might be compelled to become parties to more deals relating to the sale of more public assets like highways.
The group had dispersed after reaching consensus to say adieu to yahapalanaya at an auspicious time in the second week of next month.

Gamini Fonseka: Between  love notes and fistfights
	
The first of three articles exploring the trinity of our film industry.
The last few years seem to indicate that our stars can never truly transcend their power, their sense of glamour and fame. Hemal Ranasinghe in Pravegaya is really no different to the Hemal Ranasinghe in Adaraneeya Kathawak.
You see the same photogenic and potent features  his face, his drawl, even his strut  and you see him act out variations on the calm-and-quiet-hero-now-challenged. The same can be said of Uddika Premaratne, whose best performances (which are also the ones we remember, clearly) have him as a defeatist, the man at breaking point who needs someone to console him. (Part of the reason why the first half of Aloka Udapadi works so well in comparison to the second is that in there, the man acts out this defeatist, while throughout the rest of the movie hes a stereotypical resurrected hero.) 
When we grow used to such actors and the kind of performances we think theyre suited for, we are always put off when they veer off. That doesnt happen very often in our movies (as often as it should) but when it does we are excited. Who wants to see the same hero again and again, anyway We are tired. We want more. 
I believe its true everywhere that as a film industry matures, actors find themselves being diversified and moved on to more complex roles. The only reason why Douglas Fairbanks or Buster Keaton or even Charlie Chaplin is remembered for the cranks and adventurers they were is that they were born to the early days of film-making.
Roughly the same can be said of our own stars -- Rukmani Devi, Eddie Jayamanne and D.R. Nanayakkara. Even Joe Abeywickremas early work was limiting, and often denied him the range that he discovered in later years. 

"Gamini could never resist the camera, even when he was off-camera"
But these people had one excuse: they were there at a time when the producers demanded that they stick to one role. When a film industry matured and an actor persisted in being the hero or villain, in contrast, the excuse he had was that audiences were nostalgic and hence tired of the complexity that actors were subject to in this more mature era, and wanted a virile performer to remain virile. To a considerable extent, this explains the rise and the maturing of Gamini Fonseka. 
Critics and commentators are ever so quick to compare Fonseka with Marlon Brando and Paul Muni. To me though, such comparisons are facile, hollow, and evasive, symptomatic of how facile, hollow, and evasive the critics themselves are. Its as though these writers were not bothered about moving into what shapes and breathes life into a performance, a performer. Brando represented the Wests post-war rebellion against security and stability, while Muni, as Hawkeye Pierce from M*A*S*H* so succinctly put it, was the guy who played everybody when Franklin Roosevelt was president and Joe Louis [the boxer] was always the champ. 
Fonseka never really rebelled against stability, nor did he get to play everybody. What he borrowed from these two was their flair for researching and preparing for their roles. But what he borrowed was not what he gave out. He didnt symbolise rebellion: his box-office records would have been enough to convince him not to. Brando didnt care how big he was because he was prone to emotional breakdowns, crying out to us about his personal inadequacies. Fonseka was never that kind of hero.
To compare the one with the other would be to make two irreconcilable film cultures look similar. Hollywood likes to glamorize petty criminals, outlaws, and cranks. The Sinhala film industry of the fifties, sixties, and seventies (its richest periods) didnt want to legitimise such outsiders. Rather, it wanted a hero. Not because it didnt have any, but because every star it had, from Eddie to Rukmani to Joe (whose rise would predate Gaminis), was content to play either the second-rate jester or the first-rate lover. We were laughing or crying too much. We needed to be thrilled, to be excited. Gamini saw this void, and like all shrewd, calculating stars, he filled the gap.
Gamini could never resist the camera, even when he was off-camera. Theres a sequence in Nidhanaya the morning after he and Irene marry, where Irene comes across a caged peacock and her husband slowly creeps up to her and disturbingly reflects on how the bird can, in a sudden fit of rage, kill its own mate. Douglas Ranasinghe (who had been in Lester James Peries earlier film produced by Ceylon Theatres, Akkara Paha) told me that when he was in location at the mansion and near that cage, Fonseka crept up to him in that exact same manner and began his meditation.
I was so enchanted if not disturbed by his worldly knowledge, his serious tones, until a few days later, when I found out that he had merely been rehearsing for his part. That was Fonseka: the hero who needed to be a hero. 

"Critics and commentators are ever so quick to compare Fonseka with Marlon Brando and Paul Muni"
In an otherwise politically neutral review of Sarungale, Regi Siriwardena made the following extraordinary claim: When the time comes to draw up a balance-sheet of Mr. Gamini Fonsekas career, his role in this film as well as his part in conceiving its story and theme will have to be set strongly on the credit side against all the bad films in which he has played and his right-wing politics. 
Right-wing politics: what exactly did Siriwardena mean there Was it the right-wing politics that adorns a film like, say, Sagarayak Meda, with its barely concealed attack on Felix Bandaranaike and socialism Or was it the right-wing politics which pops up in his later performances as arbiters of law and order, even as the mellowed but potent antihero in Demodara Palama, the sequel to Titus Thotawattes Chandiya Perhaps, but that marginalises another more important point: the populist strains of Gaminis early career had by this time congealed to a rigidly conservative and right-wing ethic.
Fonsekas depictions of police officers, army commanders, and law abiding citizens were the consequence of, and not a diversion from, his earlier depictions of thugs (the good sort), prisoners (the well intentioned sort), and outlaws (the Robin Hood, Yakadaya sort). In the sixties and seventies he was the man who broke every rule in the book if that meant standing up for the wretched who were unable to stand for themselves.
In the eighties and nineties he achieved a kind of transubstantiation: he found out that outlaws, when ageing, didnt necessary have to resort to outlawing to achieve that kind of justice: they could be purveyors of the law, conservative, and still be heroes. For that, obviously, he needed to be his own star, his own director, which is what producers were only too willing to let him be in the eighties. In the end Gamini Fonseka became what hed always been wanted to become. Gamini Fonseka. 
It is said that our greatest and most accomplished actors have a fatal weakness: they cant help being great and accomplished. I firmly disagree, but I wonder whether that point holds true for an actor like Fonseka. When you see Joe Abeywickrema as Silindu and Tony Ranasinghe as Fernando you know thats Silindu and thats Fernando. But when you see Fonseka as Simon Kabilana, smoking cigarettes in that suave fashion and dextrously jumping from Sinhala to English and back to Sinhala, what do you really see in him
In the opening sequence of Welikathara you come across a star who was as able to hold a cigarette that way and dabble in both languages confidently. Its the kind of confidence that never goes away unless one consciously wills it away. Perhaps that is why a prominent actor, no longer with us, once observed that when Fonseka asked for his opinion of his performance in Yuganthaya, he had only one answer to give: That in being Kabilana, he was being himself.
Of the many performances the man gave after Yuganthaya, his role as Kabilana being his comeback (he had vowed at that point to leave the cinema; the truth was that the cinema was trying to leave him, but couldnt), only one really registers in my mind: the mudalali in Sumitra Peries Loku Duwa, easily the most self-parodying role he got in his career. We sarong-wearing folk are better than those dogs who wear trousers, remember that! he thunders to Geetha Kumarasinghe as she laments the fact that he just beat up her brother (Kamal Addararachchi). We are taken aback by his voice, but we arent intimidated; if we are, we are only intimidated to grin. 
Fonseka was channelling a real-life mudalali (the sort who was never educated but prospered through his gut instincts) he had studied for his role but eventually we realised that he was channelling himself, only this time he wasnt reinforcing his tough image, but making fun of it. Yuganthaya was directed by Sumitras husband Lester: these two were the only filmmakers who could depict Fonseka like that and get away with it.

"When you see Joe Abeywickrema as Silindu and Tony Ranasinghe as Fernando you know thats Silindu and thats Fernando"

Hes so vile in Loku Duwa that you know you have to detest him, but you dont, not because of the actors identity but because of how he forces the plot to take a detour in its second half. In the end you dont hate him, you laugh for him, that ridiculously rough accent, and that ridiculously slimy leer and grin. 
The man could have played everybody but he didnt. He wasnt being typecast against his will there, though. He wilfully submitted to what he surely knew was the only way he could sustain his life, his career, and with it his movies. By sustaining that, he might have known he was sustaining us too. He was all our idealised conceptions and imaginings of him, if not more.
And in becoming that idealisation of him wed treasured for so long, he became supremely confident that all he had to do in front of the camera was be the only person he could be. Himself. That was Gamini Fonseka at his best and (I daresay) his worst: the man who could only be what hed got us, the people, to believe he could be. I could have had class. I could have been a contender. I could have been somebody, instead of a bum, which is what I am, Marlon Brando lamented to Rod Steiger in On the Waterfront. Roughly the opposite, almost word to word, was true of Gamini. How could he have been a Brando in Sri Lanka, then

Handunnetti reveals express robbery on expressway
	
Parliamentary Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) Chairman and MP, Sunil Handunnetti yesterday revealed that losses amounting to more than Rs.36 billion had been incurred in Extension of the Southern Expressway Project (ESEP).
He told a news conference organised by the Voice Against Corruption (VAC) that the Chinese government was also responsible for the misappropriations that had taken place when carrying out the project.
He said the unity government launched the project at an estimated cost of US$1.9 billion or Rs.243 billion, which was a loan from China's Exim Bank, with the government agreeing to bear 15 per cent of the cost of the first and the second phases.
The MP said the FSDI Company which was constructing the expressway had presented an additional estimate of Rs.36 billion for extending the flyovers by 2.78 kilometers.
He said according to the original document the flyovers were to have a total length of 6.33 kilometers but later requested permission to extend them up to 9.11 kilometers.
The new requisition was submitted after the construction began and the agreement was signed. On November 13, 2016 the PMs Secretary approved the estimate but the FSDI had requested approval for the extension on November 30, 2016. It is suspicious whether the Prime Minister had permitted extension before the company's request," the MP said. He said the company had sent a letter to the RDA Senior Project Director on November 19, 2016 requesting approval for salaries of the foreign employees mostly from China with an annex of a letter sent earlier seeking permission from National Economic Council member R. Paskaralingam.
It is surprising to know that the RDA granted approval on the letter sent to Mr. Paskaralingam, he said and added that the appointments were confirmed by the RDA Senior Project Director without evaluating their qualifications but just looking at the CVs sent by the company.
The MP said that apart from the other major issues the company was permitted to import a luxury Benz Car duty free to be given to a powerful minister who has authority for the project. He said the matter would be taken up for inquiry by COPE.
We are not against expressways. But this scam is little more than the whole income received by selling the Hambantota Port to China, the MP said. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Heavy rains lash Mumbai
	

NDTV. 29th AUGUST, 2017-Mumbai gasped in waist-deep water today, lashed by what weathermen believe could be the worst rain since July 2005, when the city was devastated by floods. Citizens were advised to stay in unless absolutely necessary or go home early after the city received, in three hours, nine time more rain than average.
Incessant rain flooded low-lying areas of Indias commercial capital and paralysed train services, with many stranded at stations. Poor visibility hit flights. Thousands waded through water to reach home and children were sent home early from school.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted that he has spoken to Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis and assured all possible support. Urge the people of Mumbai and surrounding areas to stay safe and take all essential precautions in the wake of the heavy rain, he added.
It isnt a panic situation but only step outside your house is absolutely necessary, said Aditya Thackeray, whose Shiv Sena party controls the citys civic body BMC.
With the rain and the high tide overloading an ageing drainage system, people could be in for worse floods. Teams of the National Disaster Response Force have been called in.
The Maharashtra government ordered offices to allow employees to leave early. All schools and colleges in Mumbai will remain closed tomorrow, said Education Minister Vinod Tawde.
After a continuous downpour, most of Mumbai was submerged by afternoon. People were advised to avoid beaches and promenades, which will impact the ritual immersion of Ganesha idols, an annual event.
This is not a river, but a road, an NDTV correspondent said, standing in water at Lower Parel in central Mumbai. At Elphinstone, cars and bikes peeped out of flood-water.

His appointees to suffer the same fate
	

Lotteries had been tagged onto foreign affairs in a bizarre arrangement some time ago.

However, the purohita who took over foreign affairs recently did not want to sell lotteries as part of his new job. So it went back to the finance ministry where it really belonged.
Meanwhile, the white collar bigwigs of the lotteries boards appointed by the previous purohita were handed the walking papers, but they all stayed-put refusing to budge.
When the question of sacking them arose, some people said: Why should the man now down and out be further hurt Let the chaps he appointed carry on!
So the innocent one immediately went sentimental and got second thoughts about sacking his predecessors appointees.
However, an order has come from above to replace the old appointees with new ones, they say.

India and China end Himalayan border stand-off, troops withdraw
	

India and China have ended a months-long military stand-off at a disputed border area in the Himalayas with their troops almost completing a pull-out by Monday evening.
The breakthrough over the confrontation at the Doklam plateau was reached after diplomatic talks, the Indian External Affairs Ministry said.
Chinas Foreign Ministry said only Indian troops were withdrawing, but New Delhi made it clear that both countries were pulling back their forces.
We had earlier in the day announced that following diplomatic communications, expeditious disengagement of border personnel of China and India at the face-off site was ongoing, the Indian statement said.
The process has since been almost completed under verification.
The thaw comes ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modis upcoming trip to China for a summit of the BRICS group of nations.
The row over the mountainous area located near the borders of China, India and Bhutan began in mid-June. Doklam, an uninhabited plateau is claimed by both China and Indias ally Bhutan.
China had attempted to build a road through the disputed area but India responded by sending troops to evict the Chinese militarys workers.
New Delhi sent its forces in support of Bhutan as well as to halt the road construction, which it said posed a serious security concern to its territory.
Over the past few weeks, Beijing in a series of angry statements repeatedly asked India to unilaterally withdraw from Doklam. India had insisted on a mutual pull-out. In its statement, China said it would continue to exercise its sovereign rights in the area.
Chinese troops will continue to patrol and garrison in the area, it said, adding: In light of the changed situation, the Chinese side will make the necessary adjustments and deployment according to the situation at the scene.
Indian strategic analysts said that although by its statements Beijing was claiming victory in the dispute, the opposite was true. Indian analyst Brahma Chellaney said China had sought to save face by projecting the mutual withdrawal deal as a unilateral Indian pull-out.
Having claimed Doklam to be its area, China cannot publicly accept mutual withdrawal. Yet, under the deal, thats precisely what it accepted, Chellaney wrote on Twitter.
He said the Doklam stand-off was triggered by the Peoples Liberation Armys move to build a road and change the status quo, but ultimately, that bid had been unsuccessful.DPA, 29th

Jagath not fleeing Brazil, tenure ended: Ministry
	
The Foreign Affairs Ministry today rejected reports that Sri Lankan Ambassador to Brazil, Jagath Jayasuriya fled that country following war crime charges.
Ministry Spokesperson Mahishini Colonne said Ambassador Jayasuriyas tenure had ended and that he was scheduled to return to the country on Wednesday.
The Ambassador, who was appointed in 2015 till 2017 is simply returning at the completion of his tenure, she said.
On Monday, several groups of South American Human Rights activists led by the International Truth and Justice Project (ITJP) filed a war crimes lawsuits in Brazil and Colombia against the former Sri Lankan Army General, Jagath Jayasuriya.
The ITJP is a Human Rights group based in South Africa and headed by Yasmin Sooka.
Sooka had said in March that there was no way General Jayasuriya could claim that he didnt know that torture routinely occurred in his camp.
There were purpose built underground torture chambers, equipped with manacles, chains and pulleys for hoisting victims upside down. If the detainees could hear each other screaming at night from adjacent buildings, so could he, she said.
Yasmin Sooka was a member of the panel of experts appointed by former UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to advise him on the alleged Human Rights violations that had taken place during the final phase of the war in Sri Lanka. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

A top team purohita who had his portfolio changed in the recent reshuffle has come under fire from the powerful madam, they say.

The madam is making the charge that the purohita  onetime favorite of hers -- has turned his new Ministry into a family affair as done when running his previous Ministry.
Incidentally, the madams only son is now in the field expecting to carry forward the familys political legacy using the traditional pocket borough of Sirisanghabo fame as the launching pad. However, the purohita hailing from the same area has failed to show any enthusiastic support to the scion thus incurring the madams displeasure.
The madam had been so angry with the purohita that when he recently called on her in tears to complain about the move to change his Ministry, she had shown him the door after giving him a good shelling, they say.

Mosquitoes continue to bite them
	

About 10 orderlies - once referred to as peons  attached to a main government office in the city recently found to their shock and dismay that they had been suddenly transferred out to various other places.

The orderlies concerned had made inquiries as to why all of them were moved out of their present workplace for no rhyme or reason. Meanwhile, a white collar high-up of the place had discovered that a certain bigwig holding a high secretarial status in the public service had ordered the transfer of these office orderlies as punitive action. The reason: The high-up had found several mosquitoes inside the office and he held the orderlies accountable for the mosquito presence.    
Meanwhile, the employees say that mosquitoes continue to hum about this office biting even the white collar ones now and then showing no respect for their status, despite the old set of orderlies being replaced with a new set.

Newspaper still the king in Sri Lanka, official data shows
	
National newspaper circulation in Sri Lanka continued to grow, reaching higher levels than previously seen in 2016, with a greater preference shown towards daily English and Sinhala newspapers, official government data showed.
According to provisional data in the latest edition of Central Banks Economic and Social Statistics publication, 538.82 million newspaper copies were sold in 2016, up from 508.08 million copies in 2015.This is a trend which is going against the global flow, since newspaper circulation in many countries have fallen significantly, as consumers have switched towards alternates such as websites, social media, news apps and digital television, which can provide information faster, to ones fingertips.
This is a trend which is going against the global flow, since newspaper circulation in many countries have fallen significantly, as consumers have switched towards alternates such as websites, social media, news apps and digital television, which can provide information faster, to ones fingertips.
Sri Lankans too are increasingly consuming news through these alternative channels as evident from increased registrations in social media and higher usage of internet services.
Newspaper firms too have entered into this sphere in Sri Lanka in order to stay relevant.
What is causing the increased readership of newspapers is not yet clear. However, with the ageing population in Sri Lanka, the increasing elderly population may have more free time to read newspapers.
According to the Central Bank data, the daily newspaper circulation on an annual basis for 2016 had reached up to 411.76 million, from 383.13 million in 2015.
Daily, 62 newspaper copies were circulating among each 1,000 persons, up from 58 copies per 1,000 persons year-on-year (YoY).
The largest circulation boost was seen through Sinhala daily newspapers, which saw 259 million copies in circulation on an annual basis, up from 226.49 million copies in circulation YoY. The figure for English daily newspapers increased to 91.8 million from 80.73 million YoY. Annual circulation numbers for Tamil daily newspapers meanwhile fell to 60.97 million in 2016 from 75.91 million YoY.
Although weekly newspaper circulation on an annual basis increased to 127.06 million from 124.95 million YoY, the number of copies available per 1,000 persons per week remained steady at 115 in both 2015 and 2016. Similar to the daily newspapers, Sinhala and English newspaper circulations were up for the year. Sinhala weekly copies circulated for the year reached 127.06 million from 124.95 million YoY while English weekly copies increased to 24.45 million from 22.49 million YoY.
The Tamil readership base for weekly newspapers faltered as well, with circulation for the year down to 19.32 million from 21.65 million YoY.
Numerous studies conducted in the US and the EU show that newspapers give the highest return on investments for companies advertising across the entire range of media channels.
Meanwhile, the Central Bank data showed that the number of television and radio channels in operation in 2016 fell by 1 each to 24 and 54 channels, respectively. The reach of television and radio channels was not stated.

nine dead in catastrophic US storm
	

By Dylan Baddour, Sandhya Somashekhar, Mark Berman  (c) 2017, The Washington Post  Aug 29, 2017 - 
HOUSTON - The remnants of Hurricane Harvey pelted Texas on Monday as forecasters warned that the soaking rains would continue for days and major flooding would spread to neighboring states.

Texas officials said that at least nine people had died statewide as a result of the storm, as floodwaters continued to turn streets into waterways and gush into buildings Monday, a full two days after Harvey made landfall. Authorities expect the death toll to rise as rescue efforts go on and as more rain, rising rivers and surging floodwaters pummel the Gulf Coast.  President Trump late Monday pledged swift action by the federal government to provide relief to states affected by Harvey, and he is scheduled to visit Texas on Tuesday. 
Recovery will be a long and difficult road, and the federal government stands ready, willing and able to assist in that effort, he said during a joint news conference with Finnish President Sauli Niinisto.  First responders and good Samaritans took to boats to rescue stranded residents, with authorities warning that more than 30,000 people across the region could be forced from their homes by the time skies are expected to clear later this week. 
We are not out of the woods yet, Elaine Duke, the acting Homeland Security secretary, said during a Monday briefing in Washington. Harvey is still a dangerous and historic storm.  Fears also grew beyond Texas, with particular concern centering on flood-prone Louisiana, where forecasts have called for as much as two feet of rainfall in some areas. Trump on Monday declared emergency conditions in Louisiana, evoking memories of Hurricane
Katrina in 2005. 
As if to underscore those fears, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers early Monday began releasing water from two Houston dams to relieve pressure from the downpour, which has deposited as much rain in a few days as the region averages in an entire year. Most of the damage in New Orleans wrought by Katrina occurred when levees burst, allowing waters to inundate the city. 
Every major waterway in the city spilled over its banks. Gullies overflowed. Even neighborhoods far from a creek or bayou flooded. The hardest-hit areas were in the south and southeast, the downstream end of the waterways. 
But the southwest will be the next theater for catastrophe. The Brazos River, which runs through Fort Bend County about 20 miles west of downtown Houston, has been swelling as the runoff from the storm collects in its banks. National Weather Service models showed the river rising to 59 feet by Tuesday, topping the previous record of 54.7 feet.  Authorities issued mandatory and voluntary evacuation orders for parts of that area and warned that anyone who ignores mandatory evacuation orders will not be aided by first responders when the waters rise. But with virtually all the main thoroughfares already closed because of high water, many of the affected residents saw no way out. 
Kim Adoubeif, 60, was among about a dozen residents of the Greatwood subdivision who stood in the rain atop a levee on the Brazos River on Monday to gaze at the water and ponder their fate. She said she checked online traffic maps and couldnt find a route to safety. 
Every way out, there are roads that are flooded, she said, holding an umbrella against the rain. So we might not even find a way out. 
Some who did evacuate ran into difficulties Monday as they tried to reach shelters. In north Houston, for example, rescuers who picked up people forced out of their drenched homes brought them to a fire station to be transported to the M.O. Campbell Center, a school gym and activity center that had been converted to a shelter. But when the shelter reached capacity, its doors were shut, and at least 300 people were stranded at the fire station. 
The horror stories led authorities to urge patience and persistence on the part of residents needing help.

Personal agenda versus public interest
	

Practically all opposition political parties are vehemently opposed to postponing the local and provincial polls.

However, there is a leader of a minor political party playing a major role in the council who while overtly clamoring for early polls is covertly trying his best to get the polls further postponed.
This party leader had secretly appealed to a very high authority in yahapalanaya to postpone at least provincial polls for some time.
He wants to have the provincial polls postponed to buy time to undermine the political clout and the popularity of a certain provincial chief who has become a thorn in his side, they say.

Western Province Chief Minister Isuru Dewapriya said today President Maithripala Sirisena had assured he would inform him about the amendments to be made to the 20th Amendment before the council sessions on Monday.
He told a news conference that he had written to the President about some of the clauses in the draft Bill that he was not agreeable to and added that the President had also accepted the fact that some clauses needed to be amended.
The CM said he was agreeable to the clause which said the elections to the provincial councils should be held on a single day whereas he said he was not agreeable to some of the other clauses including that of transferring the powers of provincial councils to parliament, dissolving the council before the expiry of the term of office and reducing the powers of the President, Governor and the Chief Minister.
Commenting on the tense situation which prevailed in the Western Provincial Council recently, the CM said the joint opposition members had decided to defeat the 20A in all provincial councils and added that they attempted to do the same in the WPC as well. (Ajith Siriwardana)

President Maitripala Sirisena while expressing confidence that the consensual government would remain in office till 2020, said today whoever who wants could leave but he would carry on with the government that is there.
It is not me but the SLFP parliamentary group that is in the consensual government. Although some say their party would form a government on their own soon; under the current composition of Parliament no single party could form a government on its own. Even if there is another coalition, I will fulfil my responsibilities towards the people as President of the country until the end of my term, he said.
He told Media Heads and Newspaper Editors at the Presidents House that the SLFP Central Committee had resolved to take a decision on the future of the consensual government agreement between the SLFP and the UNP in December and therefore it was improper to talk about it beforehand.
Answering a question, the President said the SLFP had not proposed him as the next presidential candidate and he too had not said anything of the sort. He said there were some such views expressed by various people but no final party decision yet.

A series of coordinated attacks by Rohingya insurgents on Myanmar security forces on Friday, in the north of Myanmars Rakhine State, has triggered a crackdown by Myanmar forces that has sent a stream of Rohingya villagers fleeing to Bangladesh. It also sparked a mass evacuation of thousands of Buddhist residents of the area. At least 109 people have been killed in the clashes in Myanmar, most of them militants but including members of the security forces and civilians.

Tax concessions next monthPM
	
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday assured that the government will come up with some tax concessions next month.
The Premier made this statement at a ceremony organized by the ministry of housing to distribute housing loans to 1100 families in the Colombo District at Temple Trees last evening.
We will come up with a package of tax concessions next month. Those investors who provide employment to people will be given tax concessions under this package, the Premier said.
The country was deeply in debt when this government took over. However, today we have managed to control the debt. We have managed to control the countrys debt to some extent through the Hambantota Port agreement. Sri Lanka will be in a position to pay off its debt by 2020. What we have done during the past two years is taking the country out of the debt trap, he added.
He said the government had been able to generate 150,000 jobs during the past two years.
Minister of Housing Sajith Premadasa said over 2 million families in the country are either without a house of their own while there are others who have not been able to compete the construction. This government has already commenced work on more than 450 Uda Gamas and the government will be able to complete 500 Uda Gamas by the year 2020, he said.
Further, he said the governments in the past did not focus on housing needs of the people. Previous regime only focused on giant development projects. These projects put the country in a debt trap. The housing problem could have been solved if the funds spent for giant development projects were spent on housing instead, Mr. Premadasa added. (Yohan Perera)

The Arpaio pardon displays Trumps disdain for the rule of law
	
By The Editorial Board   (c) 2017, The Washington Post 
Aug 29, 2017 - 
President Donald Trump hinted for weeks that he might pardon former Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio. When he finally did so on Friday, the White Houses official statement lauding Arpaio failed to mention the charge for which Trump had granted clemency: a criminal conviction of contempt of court for defying an order to halt racial profiling. 
Whatever the White House may say about Arpaios selfless public service, the presidents decision is a slap in the face to Latinos and undocumented immigrants and a gift to Trumps farthest-right supporters. 
Despite Trumps suggestion that Arpaio was convicted for doing his job, a federal judge found the former sheriff guilty of contempt when he refused to cease rounding up suspected undocumented immigrants on the basis of appearance alone. But Arpaios abuse of his authority as sheriff went well beyond racial profiling. 
With pride, he detained inmates in inhumane conditions and humiliated them in the name of deterring crime. And like Trump, he rose to national prominence by casting doubt on whether Barack Obama was born in the United States. 
Trump did not consult with the Justice Department before pardoning Arpaio. Indeed, the former sheriff had not even applied for a pardon through the long-standing Justice Department system. Perhaps thats appropriate: The departments guidelines state that pardon applicants should show remorse and atonement for their actions. Arpaio has shown none. (He is now pushing for the federal court to vacate its verdict against him.) 
A pardon was Trumps second choice. Last spring, the president reportedly asked Attorney General Jeff Sessions whether the Justice Department might be able to drop the then-ongoing investigation of Arpaio. When Sessions informed Trump that such a request would be inappropriate, the president settled on clemency instead. 
The presidents authority to bestow pardons is nearly without restraint. But granting clemency for a defendant convicted of contempt of court speaks to the same disdain toward the judicial system that Trump has displayed in his attacks on so-called judges. (Arpaio has taken a similar approach, decrying his conviction as a political witch hunt.) And Trumps discussion with Sessions recalls his suggestion to then-FBI Director James Comey to drop the bureaus investigation of Michael Flynn, Trumps former national security adviser. This pardon is not only a mark of Trumps inclination to inflame rather than bind up the nations wounds. It is also a warning of his lack of respect for the independence of the courts and of law enforcement in a country governed by the rule of law -a worrying characteristic in a president facing an ongoing special counsel investigation. But Trump should take the outraged response to Arpaios pardon from across the political spectrum as a warning, too: a sign of the resistance he will encounter if he chooses to issue further pardons, particularly in the Russia affair, on the basis of political concerns rather than those of justice.

The Ceramicist Asela Gunasekara  and her exhibition i: i is also for intrigue
	
Who is the fool on the hill Thats a question that never came up in any A/L English Literature exam paper in all the years that the Beatles song, The fool on the hill was on the syllabus. Its a question I realized should have been discussed and that realization came when I saw a ceramic sculpture with the song-title about a month ago.
I knew of Kuveni but I never thought of her as a feeling or more precisely an effusively enthusiastic or ecstatic expression of feeling or as an epic poem. 
Ophelia was tragic, but I had never seen her. Nor Kuveni. Ive seen artistic depictions of Theri Sangamitta carrying a sampling of the Sacred Bo Tree in a begging bowl, but somehow they all seem embellished or distorted now. An added dimension, strangely and unexpectedly, had shelled the Arahat Sangamitta and yet given her in more wholesome form. I saw them all the same day I discovered the question regarding the fool on the hill. 
Pandora was about a box, about curiosity, flight and the horrors of life and the world. It wasnt about escape, it wasnt about embracing reality and dealing with it. Now it is. 
There was a conqueror and he came with a note: The ascetic Siddhartha Gauthama conquering the three temptations: greed, anger and lust. The necessary struggle that preceded enlightenment could not have been easy.
Torment was written on the face. 
How can one capture anything of the notion called anitya or impermanence To cast it would divest it of meaning. But then again, if approximation (of capture) is useful for reflection, then I found something useful that day. 
The full moon is for those in the northern hemisphere a man and for us in the south, a rabbit. The full moon is also a moment historically designated for reflection of the eternal verities for Buddhists. The full moon can be depicted as the Buddha, this I hadnt known. 
- Asela Oshadhi Gunasekara

Unfortunately the teacher wasnt too encouraging, but I used to look at stuff, like pictures, and draw. I was always a solitary person, so I had a lot of time. When I was not studying it was all about reading and drawing
The true worth of this artist is best assessed by those who have a deep understanding of art and especially sculpture and within that field, the medium, ceramic. But something about the works mentioned above made the images remain within or, put another way, held me within them.
The exhibition, held at the Lionel Wendt Art Gallery about a month ago was titled, simply, i. The full title: i: imperfect, impermanent, incomplete. As titles go it could have been an easy excuse for sloth and lack of skill. Untrained though I am in art and art appreciation, I realized quickly that there was nothing trivial, flippant or mischievous about i. 
The above is context relevant to what follows, which is not a review but a sketch of one of the artists featured in that exhibition, Asela Oshadhi Gunasekara. The other, Akshana Abeywardene, her son, whose photographs were on display is a talent in his own right and deserves a separate feature. Later. Now, Asela Oshadhi Gunasekara. 
Asela was born in 1973, and had been left-handed, but taught to eat and write with the right hand. She had, as a child, struggled with writing.
The Sinhala characters had come out as mirror images. She laughs about it. Apparently her husband believes that this forced switch from left to right is why she is confused. 
It hadnt been funny back when she was a child. She was chided at school for poor handwriting. She got a B for Art and a C for Handwork when she was in the second grade. She was told to try to draw colorful pictures and to practice folding paper. Today she says Art should never be a graded subject in school, for reasons that obviously have nothing to do with those silly grades. 
Asela had always been interested in art. I used to draw everywhere. And I also appreciated. I was fascinated by the pictures on the back of Readers Digest magazines. I loved Sybil Wettasinghes books. That was art and those were stories. 
I remember my grandmother showing me birds sitting on a wire. I must have been two or three then. This was in Malabe, which was at the time a place where there was enough and more wildlife. The natural world fascinated me. I collected things like feathers and seashells My father bought me books. He also had a decent collection of books. I tried to read everything, including the adult books, which my parents had to hide from me! 
By the time she was around 14, Asela remembers, she had become very passionate about art. She had taken the subject in Grade 6 when she moved from Musaeus College to Sirimavo Bandaranaike Vidyalaya. 
Unfortunately the teacher wasnt too encouraging, but I used to look at stuff, like pictures, and draw. I was always a solitary person, so I had a lot of time. When I was not studying it was all about reading and drawing. I did write poetry, first in Sinhala and later in English, but art was what interested me most. 
Asela got 5 Distinctions and a single Credit at the O/L exam, which meant she could pick the stream of her choice for the A/L. It had been another left-hand and right-hand moment in her life. Like most of her friends, she had wanted to study arts and languages,but had been pushed into biology. 
I was disoriented. I remember the first term; I knew it wasnt my thing. I convinced my mother to talk to the teachers so I could switch to the arts stream. The teachers were not willing. 
So they robbed two years of your life I asked. 
No, they robbed my whole life. Things could have been drastically different. 
She hadnt done too well. She had wanted to switch and do arts the following year, but her father had suggested she join a bank. So she joined Standard Chartered Bank, Colombo (1992-97) and in Dubai from 1997 to 1999. She quit when Akshana was born and it was only after he started preschool that Asela began to think of a different career. She enrolled in a two-year degree program in liberal arts at the American College of Dubai, affiliated to the Southern New Hampshire University.
My professors were good. I discovered different subjects like psychology, sociology, philosophy and literature, which opened my eyes to different spheres and helped me see things deeper even though they were just introductory courses. 
The tsunami brought her back to Sri Lanka in 2004. She had gone to Sumitrayo, the well-known program on drug demand reduction, in search of work. Ms Nalini Ellawala had taken her in, first as an intern and later as an administrative director. 
I wanted to study, so I got into an online MSc program in HRD at the University of Leicester. I worked with a HRD consultant for a while and later in the UNs VOICE Project as a Project Coordinator. Then I decided that working for someone was not going to work for me. 
Art was always my refuge. At the time I didnt know what conceptual art was. I had no formal training. So I decided that I should study art seriously. At a creative writing workshop conducted by Ashok Ferry in 2010, I happened to sit next to a foreign lady who gave me the number of Prof Chandrajeewa when I told her I am interested in art. 
He knew how to teach technique. He taught me to think like an artist and encouraged me to express myself. When we returned to Dubai in 2011, I enrolled in a painting class at the Dubai International Art Centre, but after studying under Prof Chandrajeewa, it was a disappointment. It was too rigid and boring. So I decided to do something else. Ceramics. 
I had two Ceramic teachers, Michael Rice from Northern Ireland who taught me pottery on the wheel and Katerina Smoldyreva from Russia who taught sculpture. It was from Michael that I learnt the conceptual element related to pottery on the wheel. I worked with Katerina for about two years. She taught technique as well as the relevance of learning art history. These two teachers helped me discover that ceramics was my medium. I set up my studio. and in 2014 started classes for kids. 
Aselas first exhibition was Dream Catchers, held at the Lionel Wendt in July 2012. It was a group exhibition featuring two painters and a sculptor, all students of Prof Chandrajeewa. In 2016 October, she was one of several online artists (from Art Space Sri Lanka) featured at another group exhibition, this time at the Saskia Fernando Gallery. 
Asela Gunasekara has wandered along paths cut and ordered for her and when the way ahead although clear seemed meaningless she left it. Thereafter, by a mix of choice and chance, she discovered a happy creative space, a medium that she feels belonged to and one she moulds even as it moulds her. Now she searches for herself through her work and i is exactly what it claims to be. It is imperfect because perfection is a brag thats more often than not a lie. The Zen masters of Japan, Asela points out, were master ceramicists and they would often pick out the most imperfect work as the masterpiece. 
Her work is impermanent and thats a concept that comes from Buddhism, which she claims has inspired her. 
I come from a very traditional Buddhist background. Something of what I heard must have registered into my head. Some of it I questioned and some I discarded. When I studied Buddhism for the O/L it made sense, it was logical. So its there in me as a foundational philosophy. Both my teachers in Dubai were very receptive to Buddhism. We had good conversations about Zen Buddhism. Michael introduced me to traditional Japanese aesthetics, Wabi-sabi, which is a world view about accepting imperfection, impermanence and the incomplete. 
Some of the titles for her sculptures are drawn from stories and this is not surprising. Apart from the natural world, the stories shes read and heard and even those which she makes in her own mind inspire Asela, she explained. 
I gave up my banking exams even though I had just two more subjects to complete. I went to Aquinas and found out about an external arts degrees at Kelaniya. Fr Herman Fernando taught me literature. He introduced me to contemporary poets and the ballads of John Lennon, Paul McCartney and Paul Simon. It was a wonderful experience.
She went on to explain why her exhibits came with titles and explanatory captions. The exhibition in 2012 didnt have any titles or descriptions. Of course art is a language but maybe it is a language for the artists and not for everyone. People were intrigued, they had lots of questions. It made me realize that when you are catering to a general audience it helps to guide them a little. I do take away their right to independent appreciation of the work itself, but I felt that for this audience, I should offer some basic guideline. Her work is incomplete, naturally. Theres exploration ahead of her. 
People ask if I have a style and I say no because I dont want to be in a box, be captured by a label. For now, I am a ceramicist, but I want to experiment with glass, mixing the two mediums and using them for sculpture. Conceptually, however, I am a bit lost. I need to find my way again. I am not sure where I would go. I will take it as it comes. 
Asela Gunasekara is an artist who will immediately say not yet given her philosophical predilections or even say never will be as per the three dimensions of i (imperfect, impermanent, incomplete). She layers her work with herself and the work and the artist do intrigue. Thats another i and not paradoxically. It all flows from the left hand, now. And it is all about the exploration of i. Simple i. Simply, i.

Three months grace period for Luxury-Vehicle Tax Defaulters
	
The Finance Ministry today announced a three months grace period from September 1 for the payment tax imposed on luxury, semi-luxury and dual-purpose motor vehicles.
They will be charged only five per cent of the penalty in addition to the tax arrears during the grace period, it said.
The Department of Motor Traffic said the tax was paid during the registration of the luxury, semi-luxury and dual-purpose vehicles and the vehicle owners were allowed to make a part payment during the registration process. However, it said many owners defaulted on the balance payment and the grace period announced by the Finance Ministry is for the payment of the balance tax due.
The ministry said the decision was taken in line with Act No.16 of 1995 and that the grace period would be from September 1 to November 30.
Cabinet approval was granted on October 10, 2016 to amend the Finance Act and the grace period was based on the amendment. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

Undiplomatic one is to get a diplomatic job
	

A high ranker who reached the topmost post in his department following a ding-dong battle last year has been asked to go by the Top Two in yahapalanaya, they say.

On thus being given notice, the man had told that he was prepared to look after an electorate in the Dambulla area if he were to quit his present job. But this suggestion had not drawn a nod.
Undeterred, he had asked for a diplomatic post now vacant in a super-capital in the West. This request too had been turned down. However, chances are that he might get a posting to a mid-east country and he is expected to quit the present job to take up the new job soon after the departments anniversary celebration due in March, they say.
A quiet character is to succeed the outgoing talkative one.

Weighing their chances
	

Several Green and Betel leaf big guns, who have decided to swim together rather than sink together, found themselves in the thick of a discussion on the upcoming provincial polls in the council lobby the other day.

The Blue party stalwart from Rajarata said the Greens might take the Rajarata council given the split in the Betel leaf party. Several others of his party present nodded their agreement.
Then their attention turned to Sabaragamuwa. And they all agreed that those coming on the Pohottuwa list would stand a good chance of winning a majority of seats.
Their general opinion was that both the Greens and the Betel Leaf ones would not be able to put up a good showing in the Eastern province.
The Blue party stalwart said they should lose no time in rehabilitating the tanks in Rajarata and providing a relief package to the peasant population there if they were to win the council in that province.
