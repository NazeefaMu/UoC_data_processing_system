Seven train services have been canceled this morning due to an ongoing strike launched by the Locomotive Engineering Operators' Union (LEOU), the Railway Control Room said.

They said seven trains were operating between Colombo-Batticaloa and Colombo-Chilaw.

Speaking to the Daily Mirror LEOU Secretary Indika Dodangoda said the strike, launched at midnight, was a protest against the extension of the service period of contracted employees while the contract period of Railway Engine drivers were not extended.

He also said that if officials were unable to provide a solution to the issue, the LEOU would take stern action during a meeting which was scheduled to be held after 12.00 p.m today. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)
