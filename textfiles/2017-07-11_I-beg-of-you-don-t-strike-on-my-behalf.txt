Professor Carlo Fonseka is seen pleading with GMOA President Dr. Anuruddha Padeniya and Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge asking them not to resort to strikes on his behalf and inconveniencing helpless patients. Members of the GMOA met Prof. Fonseka at his residence on Monday and requested him to continue functioning as SLMC Chairman. However, Prof. Fonseka rejected their requests.
