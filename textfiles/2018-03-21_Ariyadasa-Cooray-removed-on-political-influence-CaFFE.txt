National Police Commission (NPC) Secretary Ariyadasa Cooray was removed due to the influence of some political leaders, who intended to prevent a comprehensive report from being compiled on the recent unrests in Theldeniya and Digana, the Campaign for Free and Fair Elections (CaFFE) and Centre for Human Rights and Research (CHR) accused.

CaFFE and CHR Executive Director Keerthi Tennakoon said Ariyadasa Cooray was removed because he had asked Inspector General of Police (IGP) Pujith Jayasundara to submit a full report on the recent incidents occurred in Theldeniya and Digana.

“It is a public secret that the recent violent activities were aggravated due to the inefficiency of the Police. It was publicly revealed by some prominent ministers like Lakshman Kiriella, Rauff Hakeem and Dilum Amunugama that these incidents could have been mitigated if the Police personnel were deployed in a proper manner,” he said. (Sheain Fernandopulle)
