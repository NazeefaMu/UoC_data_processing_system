A move to obtain sufficient signatures to prove that Transport Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva commands the majority support in Parliament and eligible to be appointed as the Prime Minister, has been commenced yesterday noon.

The UPFA proposed the setting up of a minority government with the support of the joint opposition, with Transport Minister de Silva being tipped as the Prime Minister, a senior party member stated.

There is a possibility that a letter confirming the majority support for Nimal Siripala de Silva to take over as PM would be handed over to the President today. (Ajantha Kumara Agalakada)
