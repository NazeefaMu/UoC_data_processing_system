All National Identity cards were being issued from yesterday with front-facing images prior to converting them to Electronic Identity (E-ID) Cards, Commissioner General of the Department for Registration of Persons (DRP), Viyani Gunathilaka said.

He said the department would issue the ‘Smart IDs’ from next month and this step was initiated because of several concerns and complications over the National Identity Cards now in circulation.

However, the photos for Smart IDs, which would be issued from October onward, will be engraved on special polycarbonate plastic using laser technology. They will be made according to international standards and by using a special software provided by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO)

“The department has decided to launch a new registry for Sri Lankans by the end of next year. After collecting data, the department will issue E-ID Cards by the end of 2018 or beginning of 2019. (Chaturanga Pradeep)
