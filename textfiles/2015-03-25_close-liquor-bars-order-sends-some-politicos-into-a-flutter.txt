“Close liquor bars,” order sends some politicos into a flutter


	


	The new Big Boss the other day ordered the immediate closure of 349 liquor outlets identified as being located in close proximity to schools and places of religious worship across the country.
This order from the highest authority in the country has sent many politicos, mostly from the Diyawanna House into a flutter.
These highly agitated politicos - numbering about 40 hailing from both sides of the great divide – held council to find a way out of this sudden predicament. 
Some of these politicos run about 7 to 8 taverns each and among them are owners of illicit distilleries as well, they say. A Diyawanna member from Wayamba is said to be the owner of more than 20 liquor outlets. These liquor outlet owners have now decided to make a collective plea to the new Big Boss to go soft on them.
