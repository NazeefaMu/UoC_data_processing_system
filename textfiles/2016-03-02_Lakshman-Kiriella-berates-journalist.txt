Lakshman Kiriella berates journalist


	

Higher Education and Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella, who is now embroiled in a controversy over the appointment of a lecturer to Kelaniya University on temporary basis, had been very abusive to a journalist of the Ada newspaper when he asked him about the matter.

Mr. Kitiella had asked the journalist whether he was aware of the University Act and, if he was unaware of the powers of the minister, how he could question him about his authority.

The minister had taken a swipe at the journalist saying, "I have the authority, and I used it after perusing the appointee's qualifications. First read the University Act before jumping to conclusions. We are not using these powers. That is our fault. The former government used them.” (He used unprintable language on the journalist) “When Mahinda was in power all of you just looked up and waited. Just because you carry a pen in your .......(Again he used unprintable language), you do not deserve to be called journalists. First go and read the University act” (Again he used unprintable language). (Amith Maduranga)
