Former Minister Mervyn Silva commenting on the deaths of the youths who died recently in Jaffna, after they were shot at by the police allegedly for disobeying orders to stop their motorcycle when ordered to do so, today said the authorities had acted too hastily to take action against the police personnel who were involved in the shooting.


While expressing shock and disbelief at the speed in which the authorities had reached their decision to take legal action taken against the police personnel involved in the incident, he said a proper inquiry should have been launched to ascertain what exactly took place before resorting to this action.
“I too stop my vehicle at road blocks when ordered by the police to do so and help them to fulfil their duties. The police personnel who were interdicted and remanded did not have hatred  enough to kill thee youths. They  only tried to fulfill their duties. The relevant authorities should not have acted so quickly to punish the police personnel, involved in the incident” he said.


He said even though many people are not aware of this, the Jaffna Police had done a praiseworthy job in eradicating social menaces in the district such as drugs, murders, rapes and robberies.
