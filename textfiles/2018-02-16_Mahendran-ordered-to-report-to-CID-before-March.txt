The Colombo Fort Magistrate today issued a new order on former Central Bank governor Arjuna Mahendran to report to the CID on or before March 8.

Earlier, the Fort Magistrate ordered Mahendran to report to the CID before February 15 and directed that the court order be sent via Singapore International Police to Mr. Mahendran's residence.

However, the Interpol had failed to send the previous notice to his residence in Singapore.

Therefore, the court allowed the CID to send the notices via express mail and DHL courier service to the residence of Mahendran in Singapore. (Shehan Chamika Silva)
