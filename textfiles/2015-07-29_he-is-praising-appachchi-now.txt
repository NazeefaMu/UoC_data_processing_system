He is praising Appachchi now!


	


A Betel leaf secretarial one had to answer an unexpected telephone call the other day.  The caller was a garrulous party politico hailing from an area once well known for oranges. The man incurred the wrath of the rebel group when he declared in public soon after January 8 that, “Appachchi (father) is dead. There’s no sense in carrying his dead body around…”
He did not mind getting distanced from the rebel group at that time, because he apparently thought his closeness to the new Big Boss would secure his political future. However, the poor man found himself between two stools when his new mentor washed his hands off the Betel leaf poll campaign.
The secretarial one sounded ready to listen to him and the politico poured out his heart: “Aren’t we all in a terrible mess, Boss…  When Appachchi died we had the consolation that Bappachchi (step father) was there to look after us. But now he too is gone! What are we to do now?” The secretarial one decided to console the crestfallen politico: “Don’t get disheartened. We can win this election. After all, your district is a stronghold of ours. So there is no reason for you to worry.”
Now the politico is reportedly going round the district displaying the cutouts of Appachchi and singing his praises!
