The nominations submitted by the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) for Badulla, Mahiyanganaya, Panadura and Agalawatta had also been rejected today.

Badulla District Returning Officer Nimal Abesiri said the nomination list of Mahiyanganaya had been rejected based on a technical issue.

The list for Badulla had been rejected because one candidate's signature was included without the name. (Palitha Ariyawansha, Prasad Rukmal, Prasanna Pathmasiri)
