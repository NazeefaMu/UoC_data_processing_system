All the 77 Indian nationals, who were alleged to have been illegally held by Bhuwalka Steel Private Ltd, an Indian company operating in Sri Lanka, will be repatriated to India by Tuesday, an Indian High Commission spokesperson told the Express.
“Some were put on a flight on Monday and the rest Tuesday,” the spokesperson said.
High Commission officials met the workers on Monday and made the company, return their passports.
Families of the illegally held workers had appealed to the Indian government to ensure that they returned home, safely.
The management of Bhuwalaka Steel Private Limited had kept the workers’ passports in its custody and was not allowing them to return. The workers had had a dispute with the management over the payment of salaries. Of the 77 workers, 44 are from Bihar.
Last year too, the Indian High Commission had to intervene in a similar labour dispute in the company to secure the release of 20 workers. (The New Indian Express)
