This character is a head of a department responsible for maintaining the law and order in the country. 

 


This departmental head who gained the coveted office after clearing several formidable hurdles is said to have got into the habit of singing and dancing in uniform at evening parties and even at public functions.  Even his subordinates frown on his conduct which they say is not in keeping with his status. 


A picture showing this high-up going into a jig as he broke into a baila song at a public function in the South had been posted on the Facebook recently.


By the way, several government authorities had occasion to pull up this departmental head for various acts of indiscretion in the recent past.
