I am afraid of Thilanga because I know his past: Arjuna


	

Responding to newly elected SLC president Thilanga Sumathipala’s remarks during a recent media briefing, Ports and Shipping Minister Arjuna Ranatunga said today that he was afraid of Mr. Sumathipala because of his past.
He said there was a court case against him once for taking an underworld boss named Dhammika Amarasinghe with him to the 1999 Cricket World Cup using Cricket Board funds; and a judge of a court had been forced to bail Mr.Sumathipala out after he was remanded over that incident.
“He should have asked himself who he was before pointing fingers at me. When telling him who I am, I should point out that I was not brought up on gambling money. My mother was a teacher and took care of us with the money she earned by doing her job. People still remember what I did for my country. I do not care if one businessman who entered Parliament after being rejected by the people does not remember my services to Sri Lanka. Yes, I lost the SLC election. But I have no regrets because I know that the Sri Lanka Cricket election has been commercialised now,” he said.
Speaking of the allegation by Mr. Sumathipala that he had given jobs at the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) to several people during the SLC election campaign, he said the SLPA was not a place where he could give jobs as and when he wished; and added that if he, too, had owned bookmakers, betting centres for horse-racing and a newspaper he might have given jobs to his relatives.
He said he would respond to Mr. Sumathipala's other allegations in court, as he had filed a lawsuit against him. (Piyumi Fonseka)
