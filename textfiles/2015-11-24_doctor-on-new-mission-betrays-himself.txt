Doctor on new mission betrays himself


	


This politico, a doctor of sorts, was once in the news very often mostly for his shenanigans. Now down and out, the doctor has embarked upon a new mission:  Carrying forward the policies of the national hero the late Anagarika Dharmapala. 
The other day the doctor visited his home turf Ruhuna to win supporters for his new mission.  Addressing a small gathering of fans of the late national hero, he said though his main mission was to promote and foster the policies of Anagarika Dharmapala he did not mind coming back to active politics. He added that he may even consider switching over to another political party with a clear vision.
It soon became obvious to those present what the man was up to. They began leaving the meeting one by one. And the doctor had stopped speaking only when he found there was hardly any audience to talk to.
