UN has failed in maintaining global order: JVP


	

The United Nations has failed to perform its duty of maintaining global order, Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake told Parliament today.
Mr. Dissanayake who was speaking during an adjournment debate in the House said the UN had been acting in an unfair manner and had not treated all countries alike.
“One cannot rely on the UN when it comes to bringing redress to Tamil people" he said stating that he would like to remind the TNA of this point.
He said one could not rely on India and USA as well. The chief opposition whip actually charged that the Indian intelligence service RAW is destabilizing the North.
Mr Dissanayake who blended his fire brand speech with a little bit of emotion said a truth commission was essential as the war affected persons no matter what ethnic or religious group he belonged to had the right to know as to what had become of their lost relatives. The MP made this point by bringing out his own experience where he said he and his family were still not aware of what had become of his brother who disappeared in 1989.
"My mother went to the extent of seeking an astrologer to locate my brother"' he said. Mr Dissanayake also said people of all races and religions should be treated equally while Sri Lanka should be identified as a multi-racial and multi religious nation. (YP)
