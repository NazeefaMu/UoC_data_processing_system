A joint search operation was in progress by the police, army and the Special Task Force this evening when after four Samanera monks aged 11 to 13 years from a temple in Aralaganwila did not return after trekking into the jungle.
The four Samaneras attached to Danajaya Raja Maha Viharaya in Kandegama had reportedly left the temple around 11.00am yesterday while its chief incumbent was away.
The chief incumbent who returned to the Viharaya at about 6.00pm had learnt that the four novice monks aged 11, 12 and 13 were missing, Police Spokesman ASP Ruwan Gunasekara said.
The Thera had immediately informed the Police 119 Emergency Service about the missing Samaneras whilst the villagers also started looking for the young Bhikkhus.
SSP Polonnaruwa Division Laksiri Wijesena told the Daily Mirror the monks were believed to have entered a dense forest behind the Viharaya through jungle routes that would lead to a tall rock in the distance.
The peak of the rock which was known to have provided shelter to ancient hermits has also contains a maze of caves within.
The officials suspect whether the Samaneras have lost their way back where elephants and other wild animals were in abundance.
The SSP said several teams of Aralaganwila Police backed by an army and STF unit have launched a search operation with experienced villagers as guides on the jungle routes.
The search was in progress and no clue leading to the missing monks were established at the time this edition went to press last night. (Kurulu Koojana Kariyakarawana)
