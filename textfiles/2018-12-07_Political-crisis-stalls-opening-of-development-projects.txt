The ongoing political crisis has come in the way of opening of a series of development projects in the North Central province, they say.

 


Several newly constructed or developed roads, new community centres and many new school buildings are among the development projects awaiting formal opening or commissioning.


By the way, some political authorities who had taken the initiative to launch some development projects which have already been completed are no longer in power, they say.
