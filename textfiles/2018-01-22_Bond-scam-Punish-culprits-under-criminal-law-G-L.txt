The culprits, who were implicated in the Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) report should be punished under the civil law but under the criminal law, Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), Chairman G.L. Peiris said today.

He told a news conference that Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was controlling the Attorney General's Department and he was attempting to conduct civil case against the culprits.

“In a civil case, the suspects will only have to pay compensation. The entire loss to the country in the bond scam is estimated as Rs.2000 billion. Thus, it is essential to punish the culprits under the criminal law,” Mr. Peiris said.

He said the President and the Prime Minister should be held responsible for the bond scam because they appointed Arjuna Mahendran as CB governor.

“The PM and the President were aware that Arjuna Mahendran was a Singapore citizen. They are acting as if they had not done anything,” Mr. Peiris said. (Sheain Fernandopulle)
