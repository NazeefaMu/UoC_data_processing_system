His gumption saved the situation


	



 

There was widespread speculation recently that a former purohita from the central hills now in the JO was about to pole-vault to yahapalanaya. In the meantime, the politico had to face an unexpected dicey situation. 

 


It was the first day of the new year. About 100 constituents had called at his residence to wish him a happy New Year. At a glance, the politico judged that JO supporters present made up at least one third of the crowd. The others were Green activists most of them wearing shirts sporting the party colour. 


The arrival of the Green party activists had been prompted by a rumour that the politico had crossed over to their party the previous day.


The politico immediately judged the situation as being dicey as the two groups from the rival parties known for the cobra-mongoose type enmity could clash at any moment. 


The politico warmly welcomed both groups and hosted them to a sumptuous breakfast too. Finding that the tense situation had eased, he had told them that he had no intention to ride elephant-back and he was only waiting for the Pohottuwa to bloom. Subdued by the goodwill generated by the grand treat and the warm welcome, the Green activists had quietly left the place one by one.
