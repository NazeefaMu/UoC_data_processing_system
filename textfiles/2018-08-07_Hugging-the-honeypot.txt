A story that has gone viral in the public service sector tells a lot about the doings of a white-collar bigwig of a Ministry who is taking an extra special interest in tender affairs in the 32 establishments coming under the Ministry purview, they say. 




The man is said to be personally handling all responsibilities connected with calling and awarding tenders in all these establishments leaving his other responsibilities in the hands of his deputies.


The high political authority in charge of the Ministry has given the white-collar bigwig a free hand to handle tender matters as he is assured of the lion share from the kick-backs being collected from favoured contractors, they say.
