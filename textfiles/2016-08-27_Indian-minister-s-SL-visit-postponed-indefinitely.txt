According to reports Indian Commerce Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s visit to Sri Lanka, scheduled for this week, has been postponed indefinitely.

She was expected to be here on August 25 for a two-day visit to work out the modalities for the proposed Economic and Technology Cooperation Agreement (ETCA) between the two countries.

A embassy spokesperson said the intrusion of other commitments has warranted her presence in India. (Kelum Bandara)
