THE HINDU, 05th JANUARY, 2018 - Peru’s ex-president Alberto Fujimori was wheeled out of a Lima hospital late Thursday a free man following a controversial pardon by President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski.


A frail-looking Fujimori, 79, held up a hand to wave to supporters as aides rolled him out the main entrance of Lima’s Centenario Clinic in a wheelchair, before he was whisked away accompanied by his lawmaker son Kenji in a convoy of vehicles.


A woman repeatedly shouted “We love you, we love you!” as she tried to reach Mr. Fujimori’s vehicle through a line of security officials.
