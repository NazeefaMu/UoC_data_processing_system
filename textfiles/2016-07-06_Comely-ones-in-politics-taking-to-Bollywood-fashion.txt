Comely ones in politics taking to Bollywood fashion?


	

It looks that the love life has turned stormy for the fair and lovely ones active in politics in our country. In fact, several of them had to say adieu to their wedded bliss in the recent past. 

 


It was only three weeks ago that a fair one from a political family active in politics at provincial level put an end to her wedlock. Her father, a former purohita, hails from Moratuwa.


Soon after untying the knot, the lady had begun talking about gay rights. And the inquisitive ones had begun making discreet inquiries as to why this comely one having said: ‘I do’ at a grand star-studded wedding not long ago had to undo it so soon. 


What they discovered raised many an eyebrow: That a young popular politico from the central hills is the reason for her decision to become a free birdie again. What has surprised them most is the fact that the name of this young politico has surfaced in connection with divorce cases filed by several other fair ones in politics as well!
