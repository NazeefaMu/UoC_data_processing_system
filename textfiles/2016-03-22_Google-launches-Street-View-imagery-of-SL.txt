Google announced that Street View imagery of Sri Lanka is now available on Google Maps. This implies that people in Sri Lanka and around the world can now view Sri Lanka in 360-degree panoramic imagery from their phone, tablet or computer.

Google says, “Today’s launch brings the total number of countries where Street View is available to 76. Street View is a popular feature in Google Maps, that allows people to virtually explore and navigate places.  People can access street-level imagery by zooming into the location on Google Maps, or by dragging the orange “Pegman” icon from the bottom right-hand corner of the map onto a blue highlighted street.”

Google began driving in Sri Lanka in December 2014 and finished collecting imagery in February this year. To capture the imagery, Google drove close to 50,000 kilometers across every state and province so that one can virtually explore this landscape from coast to coast.

The company stated that in 2015, 1.8 million tourists visited Sri Lanka. By bringing Street View to Sri Lanka, Google hopes to create a new way of showcasing Sri Lanka’s beauty to the world while helping strengthen the country’s already burgeoning tourism trade.

“We are delighted to bring  imagery of Sri Lanka to Street View on Google Maps” said Helena Lersch, Public Policy Manager Google. “Sri Lanka is already a popular tourist destination, and we hope Street View will make the country even more accessible to people interested in exploring and visiting here. Whether you continue your journey in Google Maps or are inspired to visit in person, we invite you to  enjoy the Land of Lions” she continued.
