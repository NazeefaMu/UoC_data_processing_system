This one was a superstar in the gentleman’s game and won acclaim as a great willow wielder. Once he had occasion to lead the national team. Recently, he had to attend courts for failing to pay maintenance to his ex-wife and children. 
The ex-wife had filed a plaint saying she was finding it difficult to make ends meet as the ex-husband had defaulted on the alimony for several months.
However, our hero had told court that the income he was getting was hardly sufficient to pay the maintenance. Following this plea by the willow wielder the court had called for the records of payments made to him by the institution running the gentleman’s game and the records had showed that his annual income had topped the Rs.100 million mark!
“Rs.20,000 monthly maintenance is chickenfeed for him,” a senior willow wielder quipped.
