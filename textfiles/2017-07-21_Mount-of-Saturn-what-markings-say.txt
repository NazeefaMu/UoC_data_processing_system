BY A.S. Fernando.
There are certain markings which add strength to the Mount of Saturn singly or in combination. They are the Triangle, Trident, Circle, Square, or the single vertical line.


The Grille, Cross, Island, or Cross bars indicate defects either in health or in character.
The lines on the Mount of Saturn which are found on palms and what each of them signifies are given below.

 

 One single line: Great luck
	 One deep line forming the end of a broken Line of Fate: A life characterized by tranquility and monotony
	 Two parallel lines: Success late in life after much effort.
	 Number of lines: Many lines on the Mount bring bad luck
	 Several lines crossing the Mount and the Line of Heart: A misfortune 
What other signs on the Mount of Saturn indicate:

 A cross: Childlessness, infertility and impotency
	 A star: Paralysis or death sentence for committing murder
	 A star with the Line of Fate entering deeply into the Finger of Saturn: Danger of assassination.
	 A square: Safe from calamities
	 A star within a square: Escape from assassination
	 A triangle: A special aptitude for occult sciences
The Grille, Cross, Island, Dot or Cross bars also signify defects either in health or in character.

Displacement of the Mounts
The Mounts are usually formed at the base of Fingers from which they derive the name. But one or two mounts on certain palms are found displaced or inclining towards an adjoining mount.
Locating a ‘displaced mount’ would pose a problem to a novice to palmistry. Therefore, please note that if an elevation is found between the bases of the first and second fingers, it means the Mount of Jupiter is inclining towards the Mount of Saturn or the latter is leaning towards the Mount of Jupiter. If the Mount of Saturn inclines towards the Mount of Jupiter, the subject is obsessed with a morbid pride.


If the Mount of Saturn leans towards the Mount of Sun, the subject is very ambitious and hard working. He would achieve his goals in life by the dint of perseverance.


If the Mount of Saturn inclines towards the Line of Heart, the subject is very sentimental and love would bring him much sorrow.
