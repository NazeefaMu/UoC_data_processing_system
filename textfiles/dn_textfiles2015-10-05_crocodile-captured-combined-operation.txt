Crocodile captured in combined operation


The joint operation to capture the crocodile
The crocodile that was observed in the sea off Dehiwala, Wellawatte over the past few weeks was caught in hours in an operation launched by the Wildlife officials, with the assistance of the Police, Sri Lanka Navy and Coast Conservation Department, in the sea off Galle Face yesterday.
The crocodile which is estimated to be around 8 feet in length was spotted in the sea off Galle Face last week, but, officials did not succeed in catching it due to inclement weather. The wildlife officials believes that the crocodile may be around 8 years old. According to a Wildlife Department spokesman, the crocodile was taken to the Ape Gama premises where food can be supplied to it.
“We hope to keep the crocodile at the Ape Gama premises for a few days temporarily under our observation,” she said.
She said the crocodile would be released to a national park or a forest reserve later.
She requested the public to inform the Wildlife Department if a crocodile is spotted in the beach or sea off the land.
A 17 foot saltwater crocodile was sighted roaming in the sea off Mount Lavinia, Dehiwala and Kollupitiya recently. It was found dead on September 23 despite several attempts made by Wildlife officials to rescue it.
