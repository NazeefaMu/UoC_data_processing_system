Holidaying in Down Under at taxpayers’ expense


	


This fair one, a high official in the state service was the most prominent among a group that left for Down Under to follow a special course of study. Their foreign study programme had cost the exchequer a record Rs.10 million in foreign exchange. But it has come to light they had not followed the course of study despite it being the purpose of their foreign trip.
Melbourne was the destination of the white collar group, but they had spent part of their sojourn in Canberra as well. 
The fair one who returned from the costly visit was seen leaving the KIA with several bulging travel bags, they say.
Meanwhile, our envoy in Canberra has reported to the Foreign Ministry authorities that this group of officials had turned their foreign visit meant for an academic purpose into a pleasure tour at a heavy cost to the tax payer.
