The recent recovery of explosives in Vallakulam, Chavakachcheri, could be a little dangerous message, Former President and Kurunegala District MP Mahinda Rajapaksa said today.

He said the area, where the explosives were recovered had been checked and cleared of explosives; therefore they could not be old explosives.

He made these comments during a meeting held with the Nayake Thera of Getamabe Rajopavanarama Venerable Keppetiyagoda Siriwimala Thera in Peradeniya.

“The intelligence services should be implemented properly,” he noted.

“The country will have to face a difficult situation if the intelligence services are inactive. Almost half of the senior intelligence service officials are in jail. As a result of that, junior officials find it difficult to maintain contacts with relevant parties. However, this is dangerous,” he told the Thera. (Chamil Rupasinghe)
