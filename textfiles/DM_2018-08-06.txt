Boses German wife: How Bose charmed Hitlers Germany
	

Indian nationalist leader Subhash Chandra Bose was killed when an overloaded Japanese transport plane crashed in Taiwan (then Formosa) on Aug. 18, 1945. His remains are kept at the Renkoji Temple in Japan.
Bose, a charismatic leader of the younger, radical wing of the Indian National Congress and Congress president in 1938-39, broke away from Mahatma Gandhi and the party over policy matters, seeing the Axis powers (Nazi Germany and Japan) as the answer to Indias salvation from British rule.
There are those who refuse to accept that he perished in that crash. But his only child, German academic and economist Anita Bose-Pfaff, believes that he died in Taiwan on that day.
However, she has called on the Indian and Japanese Governments to conduct a DNA test on Chandra Boses remain to clear all remaining doubts about his death.

"Boses recruits initially served the Germans as the 3,000-strong Free India Legion. But, as a German invasion of India became remote by spring 1942, Hitler offered Bose a German submarine so that he could join Japanese forces in South East Asia."
For most people who continue to doubt Netaji (Boses) death in Taihoku in Aug. 1945, one possible option for proof would be a DNA test of the remains of Netaji, she says in Ashis Rays book Laid to Rest: The Controversy over Subhash Chandra Boses death.
In an interview with Hindustan Times shortly before the Narendra Modi Government began releasing declassified files pertaining to Bose, she affirmed again her belief that her father was killed in that air crash.
I think that is the most likely to have happened. If we get evidence that supports something else, I am open to that but so far I have not seen any evidence which is more convincing. In the beginning, we all doubted that he died in the plane crash, but as time passed some things came out and I was also present in the interview of some people who were survivors of that plane crash.
It sounded very convincing.it is rather fruitless with all these rather asinine theories being advanced, including that he is still alive, god knows where, or that he lived in the mountains as Gumnahami Baba, which is an insult to him, because how can anyone believe that a person who was so dedicated to his country would then go and live in the mountains and not involve himself at all and not get in touch with any member of his family

Responding to the question Do you think India would have been different if your father were alive She said:
First, I am convinced that if he were alive he would have involved himself in the politics of the time. That might have had a number of consequences. There would have been a prominent alternative to Nehru.
Of course we must consider that on some issues they had very similar views. They were both in essence in favour of a political system which was not dominated by communal controversies. They were both modern in the sense that they wanted industrialisation. But on the other hand, they would have been differences; for example, I imagine his position vis-vis Pakistan would have been different. Nobody really wanted or expected what happened after partition.

The amount of genocide left wounds on both sides which were difficult to overcome but I imagine he would have a different view towards Pakistan. If he could not prevent partition  both he and Gandhi wanted to prevent it  I think he probably would have tried and succeeded in having better relations with PakistanIndia has been suffering less from the controversies (since independence) because with all the problems India faces, it is a functioning State, and from that point of view, Pakistan is in a much worse position.
Now 73, Bose-Pfaff was only a month old when Chandra Bose left Vienna and Europe, travelling in a German submarine to a rendezvous with the Japanese. Asked about what she remembers of her father, she said:
I have no recollection of him at all. Of course, my mother told me a number of things about him. Well, she was certainly a biased person in that matter, of course. Given the circumstances, one has to be surprised that she was willing to share her life with a person who was so dedicated to a cause which took him away. Looking at this as an adult it is really more surprising that she always spoke well of him and did not criticize him because he really must have been a disaster of a husbandshe was better at maintaining correspondence with members of my family than I am.

"A. C. N. Nambiar, who was in Europe with Bose as his second-in-command, said that it was only an informal marriage. Emilie Shenkl said that they were secretly married in 1942. Anita was born on Nov. 29, 1942, in Vienna."
Her mother is Emilie Schenkl, whom Bose hired as his Secretary while writing The Indian Struggle. They fell in love and, according to Emilie Shenkl, were married at a Hindu wedding ceremony.
But there are some doubts as to if they were actually married, and she was more likely his companion. A. C. N. Nambiar, who was in Europe with Bose as his second-in-command, said that it was only an informal marriage. Emilie Shenkl said that they were secretly married in 1942. Anita was born on Nov. 29, 1942, in Vienna.
This union was in complete defiance of Nazi racial laws, which forbid marriage between Aryan German women and untermenschen (basically, anyone who wasnt German and Aryan. Bose was neither a fascist nor a Nazi. By the time he left Europe to join the Japanese, he had obtained what he wanted from the Germans: a submarine to travel to Asia, a guarantee that his Legion consisting of anti-British Indian soldiers would not be used to attack the Soviet Union. After living for months in a Berlin hotel, Bose was given by the German Foreign Office a luxurious residence along with a butler, cook, gardener and a car chauffeured by an SS Soldier. Emilie Shenkl moved in openly with him, but there was no official comment or adverse reaction from the Nazi establishment. Boses family learnt about his marriage and the child when Shenkl wrote to his brother Sarat Chandra Bose.
He obtained too, Luftwaffe (German air force) training, and acceptance of left-wing Indians in high ranking positions and even racial exemptions to marry German women. He must have been a remarkable negotiator.
As Bose later wrote:
Our daughters name is Anita-Brigitte. She should actually bear the name of Amita, but the German authorities would have certainly objected to such an unusual name so we chose the name Anita which is almost sounding like Amita. Brigitte was chosen by me because its short form in German is Gita.
Reportedly, Boses last words on Aug. 18, 1945, were: I would like to sleep a while.
Pfaff was not given her fathers last name at birth and grew up as Anita Shenkl. While she grew up with her mother in Europe, Bose was busy organising his army Azad Hind Fauj.
Boses recruits initially served the Germans as the 3,000-strong Free India Legion. But, as a German invasion of India became remote by spring 1942, Hitler offered Bose a German submarine so that he could join Japanese forces in South East Asia.

"He obtained too, Luftwaffe (German air force) training, and acceptance of left-wing Indians in high ranking positions and even racial exemptions to marry German women. He must have been a remarkable negotiator."

Arriving in Madagascar in Feb. 1943 in a U-Boat, he travelled in a Japanese submarine to Sumatra in May 1943. He organised the Indian National Army with Japanese help, and the Provisional Government of Free India led by Bose was set up in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. The INA under Bose was a model of diversity by region, ethnicity, religion, and even gender.
But Boses military skills did not match his political ones. The Japanese were unimpressed by his military thinking. In late 1944 and early 1945, the British halted the Japanese advance towards India and counter-attacked. Almost half the Japanese forces and 50% of the INA units were killed. The INA surrendered when the British recaptured Singapore. Bose had plans to flee to Manchuria to seek Soviet assistance against the British, but he died of severe burns after that plane crash in Taiwan.
The British charged 300 INA officers with treason, but they were not found guilty as charged due to popular sentiment and as it became obvious that Independence for India was now inevitable (Sources: Hindustan Times, Wikipedia).

China wont accept U.S. trade blackmail - state media
	

BEIJING REUTERS Aug 4 - Chinas state media said on Saturday the governments retaliatory tariffs on $60 billion of U.S. goods showed rational restraint and they accused the United States of blackmail. 
Late on Friday, Chinas finance ministry unveiled new sets of additional tariffs on 5,207 goods imported from the United States, with the extra levies ranging from five to 25 percent on a total value of goods less than half of that proposed by U.S. President Donald Trumps administration. 
The response follows the Trump administrations proposal of a 25-percent tariff on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports. 
Chinas countermeasures are rational, the Global Times, a tabloid run by the official Peoples Daily, said in a commentary. 
China will not rush to compete with U.S. numbers, it said, echoing comments made by state television. 
The United States and China implemented tariffs on $34 billion worth of each others goods in July.

Death toll from Indonesia quake rises to 82
	
At least 82 people are now known to have died after a powerful earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Lombok.
Hundreds of people have been wounded by Sunday's quake, disaster management officials have said.
The magnitude seven tremor was shallow, happening only 10km (6.21 miles) underground. It damaged thousands of buildings and triggered power cuts.
On the neighbouring island of Bali, video footage showed people running from their homes screaming.
It comes a week after another quake hit Lombok, a popular tourist site for its beaches and hiking trails, killing at least 16 people.
A tsunami warning was issued but was lifted after a few hours.
A spokesman for Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency told the AFP news agency that many buildings had been affected in Lombok's main city of Mataram, most of them built with weak construction materials.
Mataram residents described a powerful jolt that sent people fleeing from buildings.
"Everyone immediately ran out of their homes, everyone is panicking," one resident named as Iman said.
In several parts of Mataram, there were electricity blackouts.
Patients at the city hospital, and also at Denpasar hospital in Bali, were evacuated and tended to by doctors in the streets.(BBC)

## Title: Debt Trap and Mega Development

Debt Trap and Mega Development
	

Sri Lankas foreign debt is again talk of the town. Is the country overly indebted to China Are we borrowing too much from international capital markets Or are we financing ourselves into trouble with multi-lateral agencies like the International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank (WB) and Asian Development Bank (ADB) And how do we assess the role of foreign financing for economic development
Economic growth and prosperity requires investment. And investment can either be funded through savings or borrowings. Investment may come from household savings in banks or taxes that are not used for recurrent state expenditure. If households do not save enough and the Government does not tax enough, then external borrowings must fund investment to increase production and employment. To avoid a foreign debt trap, the Government should impose adequate levels of taxation or, alternatively, ensure it is in a position to borrow from domestic private savings to finance national plans andrelated investment.
At present, this story is complicated by past foreign loans that remain unsettled, which also require more foreign borrowings to make principal and interest payments. This is the debt trap that is worrying the country at the moment. How does the Government roll over past foreign loans Is it by borrowing from international capital markets in the forms of sovereign bonds Or bilateral donors such as China, Japan and India Or multi-lateral agencies such as IMF, WB and ADB
China or capital markets
Sri Lankas accumulated external debt stock was at US$ 28.7 billion at the end of 2017, where market borrowings mainly of sovereign bonds accounted for 39%, and loans owed to ADB 14%, Japan 12%, WB 11%, China 10% and India 3%. In addition, many loan agreements in the form of Official Development Assistance have been made over the last five years with disbursements yet to be made for a total of US$ 9 billion. Of these undisbursed loans by bilateral and multilateral donors, and this does not include market borrowings that are not agreed to in advance, China leads the pack with 22%, followed by Japan and ADB with 19%, WB with 13% and India with 6% (Finance Ministry Annual Report 2017). 
It is easy to point fingers at regional powers that have contributed to Sri Lankas foreign debt problems, whether China, Japan or India. However, as I have previously argued, the biggest culprit is borrowings from global finance capital or the seemingly innocent international capital markets, which charge much higher interest rates. 
As evident from repeated financial crises over the last few decades  most recently in Southern Europe  the consequences of international market borrowings can be devastating. And yet, IMF, WB and ADB, want Sri Lanka to open its capital markets to global finance capital, which comes with the dangers of capital inflow and flight causing crises. IMF uses the stick of the Extended Fund Facility Agreement of 2016 towards that end, while ADB and WB use the carrot of hundreds of millions of US dollars in development assistance to expand capital marketsmost recently, ADBs Capital Market Development Programme (US$ 250 million) and WBs Financial Sector Modernization Project
(US$ 75 million).
While the data above speaks for itself, why is it that there is so little discussion of Sri Lankas market borrowings characterized by sovereign bonds Is it because we like to believe we are at the centre of the world with China, India and the US fighting over us Or have we fallen for the bias of Western and regional media, which paint Sri Lanka as a pit stop in the geopolitical game, and overlook the devastation that comes with neoliberal integration of capital markets.
Funding for development
If mega development and trophy projects under the Rajapaksa regime pushed Sri Lanka deeper into a debt trap of foreign loans, the current Government is digging itself deeper by seeking mega development projects with international financing to increase GDP growth and shore up its external finances in the short-term. Here again, Chinese funded projects such as the Port City have been in the limelight, but projects by multi-lateral agencies face little scrutiny. 
The ADB funded Northern Province Sustainable Fisheries Development Project is estimated at US$ 174 million, with over a third of that amount being spent on the Point Pedro Harbour. Compare this with the Budget 2018 allocation of Rs. 150 million (less than US$ 1 million) to rebuild the Myliddy fishery harbour, currently underway in northern Jaffna. The Myliddy harbour is also more appropriate for the small scale fishing community in the North, rather than the Point Pedro harbour meant for large deep sea fishing vessels. Even more striking is that the ADB project design advance for consultants is US$ 1.59 million of which US$ 0.29 million comes from the Government. In other words, the consultancy fees for an internationally financed fishery project is higher than the total allocation for a national project to rebuild a major fisheries harbour, exemplifying the gravy train of funds for international consultants, perks for local officials and windfall profits for contractors involved in internationally financed development projects. 
A second example is the ADB water project for Jaffna, running into hundreds of millions of US dollars. An interim solution, on the order of US$ 80 million is required for a desalination plant to be built on the eastern coast of Jaffna to supply desalinated sea water at many times the cost of supplying river or tank water from the mainland to parts of the peninsula.
The sad reality, according to many in Jaffna, is that we let rain water run into the sea and then use reverse osmosis to convert sea water into fresh water. Perhaps we have ambitions of becoming Saudi Arabia or Israel, but neither do we live in a desert nor are we that wealthy! Crazy as these development projects may sound, they are increasingly the norm in many debt-ridden countries at the mercy of multi-lateral agencies.

Employees of Govt. Printing Department on strike
	
Employees of the Government Printing Department have resorted to a work stoppage from 12.00 noon today to 6.00 p.m. tomorrow thereby delaying the printing of gazettes, hansards, order papers and other documents.
However, the Government Printing Department Trade Union Federation (GPDTUF) said the strike was launched demanding solutions to several issues faced by them.
GPDTUF Convener Sarath Lal Perera told Daily Mirror that the government had paid staff members Rs.100,000 each as compensation for political victimization.
On a different note, Mr. Perera said the government had given 90 per cent of the printing of school textbooks to the private sector, thus incurring heavy losses to the Government Printing Department.
Although the department earns over Rs.400 million per annum, only a handful of officials are entitled to a monthly bonus, he said.
However, the employees of UNP-backed trade unions have not declared their support to the ongoing strike. The trade unions have informed of their demands to the relevant authorities, but had not received a positive response.
It was learnt that the department consists of some 1,200 employees. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

India and SL in contrary stand on MRIA: Wimal
	
The Indian Minister of State for Civil Aviation and Minister of Civil Aviation of Sri Lanka had expressed contrary statements on the Mattala International Airport (MRIA), Freedom Front (NFF) leader Wimal Weerawansa said yesterday.
Addressing a news conference, he said the subject minister of India had made a clear declaration in the Lok Sabha recently that Airports Authority of India had not had rounds of discussions with Sri Lanka on the lease of the Mattala Airport.
Although the subject Minister of India says so, our Minister of Civil Aviation Nimal Siripala de Silva says otherwise. He says discussions are continuing to take place with India on Mattala Airport. It is puzzling as to why the two subject ministers express contrary statements on same matter, the MP said.
However, Weerawansa said both of the subject ministers were attempting to conceal the actual scenario on the Mattala Airport.
According to Minister Nimal Siripala, the Indian Airport Authority and Sri Lanka are hoping to establish a Joint Venture Company to control the Mattala Airport, where 70% shares will be bought by India, he added.
Meanwhile, he said India was keeping an eye on not only to grab Mattala Airport but also airports in Kankesanthurai, Palali and harbours in Galle and Trincomalee.
Therefore, he said leasing out of Mattala Airport to India would provide more room for them to take hold of Sri Lanka and added it was a threat to the national security. (Sheain Fernandopulle)

Maligawa Ran Viyana work nearing completion
	

The Rs. 43 mn rehabilitation of the Ran Viyana of the Sri Dalada Maligawa or the canopy over the Sacred Tooth Relic is now nearing completion to be opened before the Kandy Esala Maha Perahera.
The work is handled by the State Engineering Corporation.
The work was entrusted on a contract signed between the District Secretary H.M.P. Hitisekera and the State Engineering Corporation.
Even in the midst of heavy rain, work was continued to meet the deadlines, especially before Kandy Esala Perahera. Further the workers have to stop work on the Viyana during the periods of service as the Ranvana is right in line with the Golden Karanduwa, where rests the Sacred Tooth Relic.
The Renovation is the result of a massive donation by the President Maithripala Sirisena at the request of the Mahanayakes of Asgiri, Malwatte and also Diyawadana Nilame asthe lay custodians.

"Renovation is the result of a massive donation by the President Maithripala Sirisena"
The Gold Canopy or the Ran Viyana was the grant of President Ranasinghe Premadasa, where a controversy arose as it is built over the oldest wattle and daub building known Vadihististanaya or the place where resides the Sacred Tooth Relic, but the Diyawadana Nilame Neranjan Wijeyratne and the Mahanayakes saw nothing wrong in building a canopy over the oldest building of the Maligawa Complex, When the work commended then they pointed out that it would be rather grant protection for the old building and would also ward off the moneys who gather over this old building., disturbing the tiles.

"The Rs. 43 mn rehabilitation of the Ran Viyana of the Sri Dalada Maligawais now nearingcompletion"
However, it was again the State Engineering Corporation who undertook this massive undertaking, taking care not to disturb the foundations of either the new building or the old building which stands today. In the recent period the present Diyawadana Nilame Pradeep Nilanga Dela had it renovated with gold strips. But, it needed a repair and the custodians had to call on
the President for this purpose.
President Maithripala Sirisena magnanimously gave an outright donation for this purpose and now thework is been carried out.

New Constitution drafted with hatred towards Rajapaksas: GL
	
Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) Chairman G.L. Peiris said today they had managed to obtain a draft copy of the new constitution which had been hatched in secrecy.
He said it had been drafted with hatred towards the Rajapaksas and contained provisions that threatened national security and interests.
Prof. Peiris told a news conference that the motive behind new Constitution was the hatred towards the Rajapaksas.
This is not the way to draft a new Constitution by targeting a particular group of people. No Constitution drafted in that manner is going to stand the test of time, he said and added that the draft had a provision for the abolition of the executive presidency and the post replaced by a ceremonial president.
Prof. Peiris said a person who had served as executive president for two terms was barred from occupying even the ceremonial presidency.
It means Mahinda Rajapaksa cannot be even a ceremonial president, he said and added that on the question of dual citizenship, anyone who had relinquished his foreign citizenship even 12 months previously was disqualified from contesting.
Such a constitution is not going to serve national interests, Prof. Peiris said and pointed out that the proposed constitution would pose a serious threat to national security. (Kelum Bandara)

People dont rely on a single early warning system: Kodippili
	


A surging wall of water caught the island nation of Sri Lanka unaware on December 26, 2004. Even though the giant mass of water eventually receded, it left a trail of tragedy and devastation. One thing was certain: Sri Lanka needed better preparation for natural disasters. In the following year, the Disaster Management Centre (DMC) was established. Its officials have since witnessed many calamities and disasters to overwhelm this island. The Daily Mirror in conversation with the DMCs Deputy Director for Early Warning Pradeep Kodippili, discussed shortcomings, challenges, capabilities and potential in terms of disaster management and risk reduction in Sri Lanka. 
Excerpts :
Pix by Samantha Perera

PROFILE
Pradeep Kodippili was educated at Kalutara Vidyalaya and the University of Ruhuna where he obtained his BSc special degree in Agriculture. He was employed overseas for seven years in the field of agriculture. Upon returning to Sri Lanka in 2007 he joined the Disaster Management Centre. Kodippili went on to study for his masters degree in Disaster Management in which he obtained a special merit first class degree from the University of Colombo. He has been involved with the disaster management sector for 11 years.


Can you explain the history and functions of the DMC
The Tsunami was the worst natural disaster to hit Sri Lanka and we were ignorant of such a possibility. As a result, we lost 35,000 lives. The Tsunami reached Ampara at 8.30 am and reached Hambantota by 9.15 am. We had a 45-minute window to warn the public and get them to higher ground. The people in Hambantota had no idea of what was happening. These were the circumstances which prompted the establishment of the Disaster Management Centre (DMC).
At its inception, facilities for the DMC were minimal. There was no properly developed early warning system. There were only three early warning towers and telephones for communication in all the 25 Districts. In spite of the limited facilities, we carried out our operations, even during the war, in areas such as Kilinochchi and Mullaithivu. The DMC gradually developed, especially with the establishment of the Early Warning System (EWS) in 2004. Today we have 77 early warning towers around the island under this system.

"The perception of the people plays a significant role. There is no point in receiving the warning if you dont react appropriately"
How does the emergency response system operate
DMCs prime responsibility is to save the lives of the people. Once we receive the technical data, our responsibility is to disseminate this information to the ground level from the top and to save the public.
The Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) coordinates all response agencies during a disaster to minimise the adverse effects of disasters and is manned by at least 20 persons every hour. There are three units comprising the tri-forces and one police unit in addition to civilians. It is a 24 hour and 365-day operation which is connected to other international organisations and agencies which issue disaster warnings. The Meteorological Department, the Irrigation Department, the National Building Research Organisation (NBRO), the National Aquatic Resources Research and Development Agency (NARA), the Geological Survey & Mines Bureau (GSMB) are also linked with the DMC throughout the day.
We also have the emergency response committee which is a body involved in every emergency operation in the country. We meet with these stakeholders every three months, especially before the monsoon seasons to discuss future plans and operations. NGOs and INGOs too collaborate with us.
The greatest strength for disaster management in Sri Lanka is the National Council. It is represented by the President as the Chairman, The Premier as the Vice Chairman; there are almost 20 stakeholder ministries, 9 Chief Ministers and the Disaster Ministry Secretary. This coalition makes it easier to arrive at decisions and conclusions.
Doesnt its involvement complicate matters relating to disaster management
The national council is represented by the opposition leader and opposition MPs. Rather than a political entity, the national council is a body established to ensure security and safety of the public. I have observed that every possible factor to develop the disaster management process is deliberated here, without which I believe the disaster management sector would not have developed over these past 12 years since 2005.

"I myself am a victim of the 2004 Tsunami and spent almost three months in a hospital undergoing treatment."
Are there any shortcomings you have observed in issuing disaster warnings
There are major shortcomings I have observed on part of the public, for instance when they dont heed evacuation warnings. The EWS by design can be activated at any given time but it is important that we receive the technical data at the proper time as well. For instance, if there is an imminent storm, the technical data should be made available by the Met
department accordingly.
Does the DMC receive such data on time
There have been many developments over the years. But I believe that there should be more. For instance, if there is a threat of a landslide, the National Building Research Organisation (NBRO) would alert the area of a possible landslide. But they are still in the process of developing their capabilities to identify the exact location of the imminent landslide. The focus should be on the all-important window before the impact of a natural or manmade disaster, where response teams can engage to effectively minimise damage to lives and property.
Disaster management, early warning and emergency operations are processes which should be developed over time. However, I expect more support from the ground level. In other words, the support we receive from the villages should improve in order to strengthen the national level operations. For example, if we alert a certain village of a forthcoming disaster and if the message is not carried out to the villagers in time, our efforts serve no purpose. Therefore the channels of information should be developed.

"People usually dont rely on a single early warning system. When an early warning is received through several channels, people are likely to attribute more credibility to the threat"
The DMC has created a self-evaluation method in the case of landslides, while there is also a method of spreading awareness and information through the Police and the tri-forces. The 77 warning towers for storms and tsunami alerts operate in all three languages. VHF/HF communication networks are linked over the 25 districts. A system of information dissemination within the district has also been created. Even though these systems are in place, I believe that they need continuous improvement.
What are the weaknesses you observe on the ground level
During the 2016 and 2017 floods, we received data from the Irrigation Department as well as the ground level network. Accordingly, we issued evacuation warnings. In the case of the 2017 floods, we had issued the evacuation warning before 8 pm. There was sufficient time for evacuation as heavy rains lashed out only in the early hours of the following morning between 3 and 4 am.
Many residents told us that they evacuated as soon as they heard the Police warnings. Almost 78,000 people saved their lives. However, about 14,000 people were trapped. They felt that they were unable to leave their homes and properties. Some sought refuge in upper storeys of various buildings despite calls for evacuation.
Therefore the perception of the people plays a significant role. There is no point in receiving the warning if you dont react appropriately.
In response to these shortcomings, we have identified the most vulnerable areas and trained residents on how to face similar disaster situations. Evacuation routes and points have also been demarcated and shared with them. If this knowledge we have provided them with is not used at the appropriate time, our functions and purpose here are futile.
What other shortcomings have you observed
In other countries, we have observed that disaster situations are imprinted in both memory and history. The experiences of one generation are passed on to the next. However, in Sri Lanka, the next generation may not have a clue of what a Tsunami is. We conduct awareness and training sessions all over the island and have noticed that the participation of youth is inadequate. In contrast, awareness projects carried out in schools have been very successful; children are keen to learn about this subject. However, the youth beyond the school age group is very reluctant to participate in any disaster management related activity. The over 30 age group up to 50 years of age are the most likely to participate in disaster management related exercises. As this age group is frequently occupied, there is no transfer or sharing of knowledge. This is a persistent issue.
I myself am a victim of the 2004 Tsunami and spent almost three months in a hospital undergoing treatment. Even today, I share my experiences and knowledge, not only with my children and family but those around me as well. Likewise, the knowledge transfer mechanism needs to evolve further in Sri Lanka.

Youth reluctant to participate in disaster management efforts
Need a system to alert residents in areas prone to inundation
Need to effectively enforce existing laws to make climate change adaptation a success
Which areas have the DMC focused on improving
We have given more priority during this time for training exercises. Samurdhi officers, Grama Niladhari officers and social workers are being trained at present in a district level. Our objective is to mould them as Trainer of Trainers in villages where they can assemble residents and work with each villager. This has been completed in 16 districts thus far.
The Apadawata Pera Sudanama (Preparation before the disaster) disaster prevention programme was launched recently by Minister Duminda Dissanayake. It involves the accumulation of data in every district. This collection aims to mitigate future disasters through adequate preparation.
In Malwatu Oya, a 12 km stretch that has been blocked, is being cleared before the approaching monsoons in order to prevent inundation, which has hampered lives of many residents in this area. This will ensure that when the spill gates of the Rajangana Reservoir are opened, the residents will be protected if the water passes through without any blockades.

How would you evaluate Sri Lankas disaster risk reduction capabilities
Disaster Risk Reduction is a very costly exercise. But prevention of disasters saves us a much heavier cost of lives, property, public funds and ultimately the funds used for compensation of victims. The overall objective of drills and awareness programmes is to acclimatize civilians to disaster management processes. Annually almost 300 drills are conducted. During a national drill, all 77 towers were activated at once and more than 20,000 people were evacuated in one day. We have also participated in an international drill with 28 countries in 2016 November. Some lessons on disaster management have also been included in the syllabuses for school children.
How strong is the DMC in terms of technology
Disaster warnings must first be issued from the designated technological authorities and departments which overlook specific areas. Once we receive their information, our units are activated and we initiate the process of issuing warnings.
Every early warning tower is equipped with self- solar power generators. We rely on VHF and satellite technology. Satellite technology is however expensive, but human lives are more precious, therefore we utilise this technology. When disasters strike, mobile networks are not reliable. Even though our connections have been prioritised I dont trust that mobile phones are a good medium to communicate in instances of disasters. Therefore we rely on the VHF/HF technology. Our transmission stations in Pidurutalagala, Gonagala, Laggala, Kokkavil and two way communication systems in our mobile units ensure that messages are carried out through our frequencies whenever needed. The SMS and Cell Broadcast messaging systems are utilised to alert the key communicators including media. There is also the mobile application called DEWN: Disaster Early Warning Network. The app is designed to alert the public to any disaster and is free to download.

Disaster-related experiences should be shared in order to transfer knowledge
In other countries, we have observed that disaster situations are imprinted in both memory and history
Data being collected from every area to facilitate disaster risk reduction
What improvements do you propose
DMC, NBRO, Irrigation Department, the National Disaster Relief Services Centre and the Met Department are all concerned with disaster management. It is important that these entities function under one ministry. I would, however, propose that more disaster management related organisation such as the GSMB and NARA function under one authority or parent body.
We have provided all districts in the coastal belt with warning towers. Similarly, if there was a system to warn residents along the rivers, especially to warn the settlements prone to inundation, it would be a great service. Discussions are underway to establish such a system, together with the Moratuwa.
People usually dont rely on a single early warning system. When an early warning is received through several channels, people are likely to attribute more credibility to the threat. Therefore it is imperative that we have not just one or two alternatives but 7 or 8 alternate warning systems in place, especially in disaster-prone areas.

How do you view Sri Lankas progress in terms of climate change adaption
Climate change undoubtedly affects every part of the world. Intensified rains and heavy winds occur more frequently. Human practices are a major contributor to climate change, be it carbon dioxide emissions or deforestation. It is my belief that climate change is worsened by the actions of the Sri Lankan public. Regulations to curb negative effects, therefore, must be in place. For instance, the settlements in river banks have caused major devastation. Deforestation is another severe issue. Forest fires caused by humans are reported too frequently every year. Climate change is a major problem for islands of the world. Sri Lanka needs to effectively enforce the existing laws and regulations in order to make climate change adaptation a success.

Political scholarships: Neville Fernando rejects Wijeyadasas claims
	
SAITM founder Neville Fernando today rejected claims made by Higher Education and Cultural Affairs Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshes that scholarships were given to SAITM students on political grounds.
He said the minister had never spoken to him on the matter of scholarships though he claimed to have done so.
Politicians including former president Mahinda Rajapaksa may have sent letters, but scholarships were never provided on those letters, he told Daily Mirror.
However, Dr. Fernando admitted that Rs.400 million worth of scholarships were given by SAITM as stated by the minister was correct but they were never politically motivated.
The scholarships were given only to deserving students; those who had very good marks but could not enter the university because of economic issues," he said.
Dr. Fernando said lots of MPs including JO MP Dinesh Gunawardenamade made the same mistake when they claimed that SAITM scholarships were granted on political grounds but those were baseless allegations.
He said the minister was attempting to level these allegation because they were in trouble with the scholarship issue.
Dr. Fernando said he had to pay some Rs.3.5 billion to the bank and he was unable to pay the money because SAITM assets could not be sold without the approval of the Board of Investment (BOI) of Sri Lanka.
BOI projects cannot be acquired or nationalized. But this Government brought a special gazette notice and abolished SAITM by saying it was not up to standard. Im in trouble because of that. I have to pay the bank Rs 3.5 billion. The bank is demanding the money. There are parties prepared to buy SAITM and they like to pay the money in advance but the bank wants the full amount in one go," he said. "One person cant buy both the Dr. Neville Fernando Teaching Hospital (NFTH) and SAITM. So, |I have to sell them separately. This takes a longer period because the buyer has to obtain Cabinet approval. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

SAITM students registration to KDU today
	
The registration of SAITM students at the KDU would start today amidst strict regulations that those who failed to pay the course-fee by Monday would not be enrolled for the MBBS degree.
The new condition had shattered the dreams of top three students, with the top A/L results to join the University over financial constraints.
It was learned that at least three, including two female students, who have the highest A/L results among the SAITM students, had to give up their enrollment at the General Sir John Kotelawala Defence University (KDU) due to financial difficulties.
Among the top results, there are students with 2As and 1 B, 2As and 1C, 1A and 2Bs and learned that most of the scholarship holders are having a Z-Score over 1.7.
Speaking to the Daily Mirror, parents of the scholarship holders said the with the Government decided to cancel the scholarships their children had faced a severe inconvenience.
There is no way that we can find Rs. 1.3 million per annum as course fee. We have written to President Maithripala Sirisena to provide us with a relief, a parent said.
Our children received scholarships as they have good A/L results. Their time has been wasted and we are helpless as parents, the parent told the Daily Mirror.
The parents said their children were going through a tremendous amount of stress and anxiety because of the new condition.
They said that their children accepted the scholarship at SAITM solely because of their interest in studying medicine and there was no political intervention behind the scholarships.
According to the parents, the majority of scholarship holders were with high A/L results and their parents were low-income receivers.
They said that the authorities had neglected them stating the scholarships were based on political intervention and refused to grant any relief.
We assured that the students with top results would have no political connections and were granted the scholarship based on their talent. Our children have to suffer because of the tug-o-war between the two Governments, a parent said.
They said that the SAITM degree was advertised as the University Grants Commission (UGC) approved one, and as such, the Government was responsible for their childrens education.
We beg President and relevant Ministers to not to play with our childrens lives. If the SAITM degree was affordable to us then our children wouldnt be selected for the scholarship scheme. Without checking our financial background, it was inhumane to just reject our children at KDU, they stressed.
The Students Action Committee of SAITM in a letter had informed the injustice faced by the scholarship holders and said it would stage protests outside the Presidential Secretariat this week.
We will even resort to fast unto death if our children were rejected today, a disturbed parent said. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Criticizing the governments move to increase the salaries of MPs, the Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) today said their salaries should be based on their performance similar to any other organisation.
PHU Leader and MP Udaya Gammanpila said the government should evaluate the progress it had made so far before increasing the salaries of the MPs.
In any institution, the salaries of employees are usually based on their performance. The employees who work hard should receive salary increments and those who are slacking off should get their bonus reduced. The government should follow this method and do a self-evaluation, he said.

Scorching temperatures  claim lives
	

UK, (Daily Mail), 4 August 2018 - The heatwave has been blamed for causing an extra 650 deaths so far this summer.
And one doctor has warned that the toll could reach thousands.
Official statistics show a spike in the number of recorded deaths in England and Wales during June and July, with experts blaming soaring temperatures for many of these.
Health officials have warned that the elderly are particularly vulnerable to heatstroke and dehydration, which can cause organ failure.
Preliminary figures from the Office for National Statistics show the number of deaths registered during the hottest fortnight were 663 higher than the average for the same time over the past five years.
Between June 25 and July 9, temperatures reached 28C (82F) or higher for 15 consecutive days.
Dr Nick Scriven, president of the Society for Acute Medicine, said: Heatwaves causing dehydration can lead to many issues, especially in the frail elderly, causing dizziness and falls through to an increased risk of infections, heart attacks and strokes.

## Title: Social awareness of the  corporate sector

Social awareness of the  corporate sector
	

One of the most profound strategies that have been adopted by social conscious corporations is the triple bottom line a.k.a TBL accounting framework that covers the social (people), environmental (planet) and economic (profit) Some also call it the PPP framework. This article is written from a perspective beyond the accounting standard. In fact, it discusses very little of the accounting standards of the TBL process. The article and its arguments are based on social awareness that the business world can and must engage to deliver the commitments to make the planet a better place for all its peoples, societies and communities. 
What does this mean to the global business fraternity Lets look at the 3 Ps and address them individually to get a better understanding of the triple bottom-line process from a socially conscious perspective. When organizations believe and want to practise the 3Ps, they have some fundamental obligations ahead of them. primarily, what is expected of the triple bottom-line process is for organizations to be transparent, accountable, responsible and to be respectful in their businesses and in their actions.
Social equity
This is the principle in the TBL process that belongs to the multiple stakeholders or People that the business deals with directly and indirectly. As businesses deal with many people, its focus must be on its employees who drive the business forward, its customers who make sure profits are accrued to the business and its suppliers and the supply chain that makes the products and services of the business. This tripartite structure in most businesses forms the first P, that People are of its primary importance in the triple bottom-line process. I use the word stakeholders as opposed to the old paradigm thought that shareholders come first in the growth and journey of a business enterprise. Shareholders are confined to those who share profits of the organization in many ways such as dividends. The social equity of stakeholders takes a more holistic view of the engagement of people beyond shareholders and shareholder value in the enterprise. 

"The most affected sectors by way of livelihood in many nations including Sri Lanka are the agriculture and fisheryindustries"

The holistic and inclusive nature in engaging with people in an equitable way is to look at the human capital of the enterprise with utmost respect and responsibility. In the TBL process companies or enterprises dont want to jeopardize their businesses with the wrong business motives such as its supply chain employing under-aged persons or child labour or using modern slavery and exploitative methods to get work done. Many years ago, the Sri Lanka apparel industry launched a campaign titled Garments without Guilt. There have been similar campaigns elsewhere. 
There are other aspects of the TBL in that its People pillar requires a brief explanation. One such thing is fair trading. Enterprises whose supply chain has a direct, indirect or outsourced supply, materials and even personnel, the enterprise has an obligation to ensure that its trading policies are very fair to the entire supply chain in both the input and output of its products and services. Enterprises that are conscious of this factor will go to the extent of creating ethical trading policies to its wider business constituencies. 
Nature equity
Our lives and businesses are all aligned to nature or the planet we serve and live in. It is commonsense that if we dont protect the planet or the environment, we will only continue the destruction at the cost of unplanned development and greed for profit. 
Already, there is colossal waste that is washed away and absorbed in to the environment and the planet is in very serious peril. If, products we manufacture contaminate the water and the air we breathe, we are not doing justice to the planet and to lives. We must realise that it is not only the unwillingness of political rulers and ill-conceived environmental policies that are responsible for the destructions of the planet. Large corporations are equally to take responsibility. 
Almost all countries face some form of climate related destruction. In Sri Lanka we are faced with floods, drought, sea erosion, and landslides. These destructions recur every year at greater intensity. Every year there is loss of life. The most affected sectors by way of livelihood is the agriculture and fisheries sectors. 

"TBL does not engage employing under-aged persons, child labour or modern slavery to get their work done"
In dealing with the TBL process, the Planet is the second important pillar that enterprises must maintain an acceptable ecological footprint or the carbon footprint in their businesses and fulfil their eco capital in the TBL process. In fact, the time is now for entities to commit to a carbon footprint and practise it with diligence and improve on it every year. We must be mindful that enterprises that harm the ecosystem for profit are also harming the very lives of people who are their consumers. It is an extremely short-lived strategy. 
The new global community is very active and mindful and have formed groups and communication channels and blogs through digital social media space in spreading the good news and the bad news alike. This has led to instant 24x7 activism in the global media in a rapidly evolving inter and intra connected world. Companies and their brands can be exposed to a large global constituency in an instant. Global brands, companies and enterprises must be mindful of this.
Economic equity
All businesses and enterprises for their continuation in the geographies they function will rely on profits for their sustenance and growth. In the traditional sense profits were linked to shareholder value and dividends. The planet or the environment was of secondary importance. Organizations have had ethical standards mostly in accounting practices and to some extent in their manufacturing policies. These practices and policies have changed as markets have expanded, consumers have evolved to embrace brands, product and service categories differently, the media landscape has changed dramatically, and competition has reached a new level. In this backdrop enterprises have either fine-tuned their industry policies and strategies to meet the new wave or are continuing to rely on the old paradigm. Either way, we have witnessed destruction of humanity and the destruction of standards for the sake of profits.
The good news is that there is a global community emerging that is not only watching but acting against those who are responsible for the many forms of destruction in global business. There is a global community of activists that are telling corporate and businesses where they go wrong. The global community has formed strong lobby groups to bring new change to the world with intentions of making it a better place for humanity. 

"Enterprises that harm the ecosystem for profit are also harming the very lives of people who are their consumers"
Consumer forces are beginning to realise and question brands and services beyond the customer service and brand experience. They want to know the DNA of the brand. More customers are willing to drop brands if their makeup is questionable and have violated certain fundamental principles and that have affected the social and natural equities or people and the planet. 
We hear stories coming out of the cotton industry, the Palmolive industry, the cocoa industry, the mining industry, apparel industry, the petroleum industry, the pharmaceutical industry, the processed food industry, agro-chemical industry, bottled water industry, food industry etc where ethical practices are violated either through the supply chain or the product not living up to universal standards or the people working for these industries directly or indirectly being not given decent working rights and living wages. Stakeholders that include customers are demanding that corporate and business entities embrace transparency and accountability in their business offerings to the world.
Concluding thoughts
The time is now for organizations to visit or revisit their corporate vision, mission, goals and objectives and the strategic plans on the lines of the TBL process with a lens on social awareness and what it means to people, the planet and profits.
It must not use the social capital framework as a disguise to cover the ills of the corporate entity concerned. Sometimes we see corporate social responsibility programs designed to cover up the ills of the corporate entity. These bogus strategies can be smelled from a mile away. 
It means being responsible and accountable for your business to be run on ethical grounds including complying with tax regimes. It means that believing that profit at any cost is not and should not be the only thing. It means that people who come together to make and nurture a business throughout the entire supply chain are part of the company landscape that must be recognised beyond wages alone.
Companies must remove themselves from the belief that employment especially to the lower ranks is a favour to such cadre. Supporting their workers to reach their economic fundamentals is one thing. It must not be done at the cost of not recognizing and respecting the social fundamentals of the worker.
My parting comment is that every business deals with people. We have choices. Either we choose to profit at any cost or choose to take a more humane approach to the business. Profits must remain a goal in any entity. It is how one approaches to make profits is what matters. The humane approach of understanding people is without a doubt a smart way to address business.

WAR CRIMES AND CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY - EDITORIAL
	

Since World War II the period between July to September has seen the largest number of war-related killing of civilians. 106,829 civilians have died in the Syrian civil war between 2011 and July 2018 and around 30,000 persons have died in the Libyancivil war.
On September 24, 2015 the US-led United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) resolution on Sri Lanka was tabled. The resolution called for wide-ranging reforms and a domestic accountability mechanism with international involvement.
The resolution in fact calls for the institution of a hybrid court or hybrid mechanism to try persons alleged to have committed war crimes during the civil war which commenced in July 83 and ended in
May 2009.The UN has claimed that during the final stages of the war around 20,000 Tamil civilians were killed by the Sri Lankan military.
The killing of civilians is considered a war crime under terms of Article 25 of the Laws of War: Laws and Customs of War on Land (1907 Hague IV Convention) states that, The attack or bombardment, by whatever means, of towns, villages, dwellings, or building which are undefended is prohibited.
Killers of civilians need to be brought to book first as an example that the countries of this world and particularly the people of Sri Lanka will not tolerate premeditated killing of its people. Secondly it sends a message to perpetrators of these crimes, that immunity will not be granted under cover of war.
It is perhaps for these reasons the government of this country in September 2015 decided to co-sponsor the US-sponsored resolution against itsmilitary personnel.
Which brings us to a moot point; at the end of World War II on August 6 and 9 in 1945 the US nuclear bombed the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan. Both densely populated civilian areas.
Having dropped the Atom bomb on Hiroshima, Brigadier-General Paul Warfield Tibbets (Junior) -- the pilot of the first plane (Enola Gay) to drop the atomic bomb -- said to have blinked from the flash behind his goggles. When he opened his eyes to look down, what he saw, he described as a peep into hell. At least 200,000 who died from the combined hellish force of the two atomic bombs, many more were scarred for life, including future generations harmed by radiologically caused birth defects, etc. The co-pilot of the Enola Gay, Robert Lewis, wrote in his flight log, My God! What have we done
Even the top US commander in the Pacific, General Douglas McArthur admitted that the Japanese were already beaten by the time the bomb was dropped, a view endorsed by the head of US air operations in the Pacific, General Curtis LeMay, who said, Even without the atomic bomb and the Russian entry into the war, Japan would have surrendered intwo weeks.
Sadly even today the none of the democracies in the West or the NGOs and INGOs who lobbied for justice for the Tamil people of Sri Lanka see no reason even today, to pressurize the international community to sponsor a UN resolution calling for a wide-ranging inquiry and accountability mechanism with international involvement into the nuclear bombing of Japan by the US, especially at a time the Japanese were defeated and on the point of surrender.
The falsehoods uttered by then US President Harry Truman... The world will note that the first atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, a military base... an absolute lie and cries to the heavens for justice.
The deceit of the then US President describing two densely packed civilian townships as military bases is a continuing process matched by the present day incumbent of the White House who is today threatening Iran with nuclear attrition to prevent that country from possessing nuclear weapons.
War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity need to be exposed and war criminals need to be brought to justice via the UNHRC. As much as the crimes Hitler committed against the Jewish people are condemned as War Crimes and the Nazis who perpetrated these crimes were prosecuted, so the US and its military, who nuclear bombed helpless Japanese civilians need also be exposed.
A failure to do this only promotes the belief that the rich and the powerful can get away with any type of dastardly deed.

Whats New in the 2018 Samsung QLED TVs
	
HanBae Park  Managing Director and Sabry Ansar - <U+200E>Deputy General Manager (CE) of Samsung Sri Lanka
Samsungs QLED TVs, which introduced the worlds first cadmium-free Quantum Dot technology, were unveiled at a First Look event in Colombo on August 6. The 2018 QLED TVs feature improved picture quality, design, connectivity and intelligence, creating a truly limitless TV. The new range of TVs offer amazing picture quality through 100% Colour Volume and HDR10+ functionality which brings out hidden details. Fusing a slim, sleek and premium metal body with a nearly bezel-less display, QLED TVs set the tone for exceptional sophistication.
To create even more stunning picture quality, the TVs feature new Direct Full Array backlighting technology that ensures that the screen is illuminated accurately. This reduces blooming and halo effects and enables deeper contrast, with inky blacks and brilliant whites. Advanced Anti-reflection technology ensures that the TVs spectacular picture quality can be enjoyed from almost any angle, and also helps boost contrast. Aligned with the new products, which include models up to 65 inches in the Sri Lankan market, Q Engine technology automatically upscales on-screen content to UHD levels to further enhance viewers immersion.
With this range, Samsung introduces Ambient Mode. With the Ambient Mode, you can convert QLED TV into a canvas that expresses your moods and acts as a window to the world. The TV can mimic the pattern on the wall behind the TV to create an astonishing visual effect in which the TV blends seamlessly into the wall. Also, the TV will automatically show you the weather to reflect whether it is sunny or rainy. Moreover, you can personalize the background with your own photos or from a selection of stunning artworks. It is very easy to access the Ambient Mode by simply pressing the hotkey on QLED TV remote.

Where is our country heading
	
Continual student agitations cripple the state higher education sector

People in this country are unrelentingly exposed every day to a ceaseless media spectacle on alleged mega frauds involving well known personalities running in to millions of US Dollars. Those often hog headlines relate to gigantic scams on abuse of public funds. Sri Lanka has lived on borrowed money for years. Astronomical scale of borrowings resorted to by successive regimes have led to a draconian debt-trap, a proverbial Sword of Damocles being held on the common masses. US$ is going up rapidly as stock market is dropping. It presages that things are not alright as claimed. 
Colossal public accusations made against leading figures manifest the gravity of political chicanery, mismanagement and screw ups persisted for long. Seemingly they involve reprehensible abuse and squander of public funds on sinister self-serving schemes at the expense of pressing public needs for which such funds are earmarked. Whilst misuse and extravagance of public money lead to severe economic woes on poor, distress and agony further exacerbate when such funds mostly represent borrowings carrying exorbitant rates of interest. This causes economic woes to further compound by greater margins. 
People thus end up having to cough up more out of meager incomes to pay multitude of taxes and levies to finance mounting debt burdens occasioned by financial sins committed by political masters, who not so long ago had been entrusted with the sacred duty of prudently managing public purse conforming to best practices of financial discipline and accountability. It is a cruel irony that poorest of the poor unable to make ends meet are made to pay taxes through the nose to make up for the fiscal adversities caused by acts of skulduggery on the part of those ascended to power through gullible poor mans vote. Whilst poor man is made to pay taxes those accused of swindling are able to indulge in a host of state funded tax free benefits and luxuries ultimately paid by the poorest of poor. 
This phenomenon is alleged to have persisted in varying degree under different degrees. However fact remains despite the gravity of the scale of the alleged abuses and violations, precious little has in fact been done to bring real culprits to book. It points to painful delays and glitches inherent in the Sri Lankan legal system susceptible to exploitation by corrupt elements wielding financial and political clout. Moreover such delays could also be attributable to possible unpardonable offences of complicity and betrayal of public trust on the part of those ruling the roost. Anti corruption action targeting big fish except few exceptions has largely been confined to empty rhetoric burst out to steal limelight and hoodwink the electorate majority of whom still remains naive uninformed and easily gullible. 
Big or small many politicians stand accused in common mans court having failed to uphold high standard of morals and financial integrity expected of public roles for which they have been ensconced in seats of power. The body politic has become a stinking quagmire with fingers pointed by rivals groups at one another in accusations and counter-accusations. Whilst some are accused of colossal wheeler dealing and crafty machinations, others are also accused of protecting traffickers and offenders. 

"A general decline in the standard of discipline across the society with noble human traits like morality, empathy, camaraderie that have kept people closely knit for centuries seem to be fading away"
There is media frenzy of an unprecedented scale. It is seemingly driven inter alia by crass commercialism and populism with political undertones. Hyped up star craze is engulfing people from very young to old and not even toddlers are spared. Tender age ones are made to perform gyrating acts of dancing to the tunes of ghetto blasters in spectacular display of jitterbugs and jigs mostly emulating Indian tinsel world dance sequences. Night time prime slots are hogged by mega tele serials depicting soap operas followed by near bed time political talk shows of clashing personalities washing dirty linen in limelight spewing acrimony hostility and repugnant venom. 
TV news bulletins are quite often replete with vivid portrayal of heinous acts of criminality involving murder, rape, shooting, looting, commotions, theft etc which sometimes are supported by graphic CCTV footage. There is hardly any news that does not report fatal road accidents causing destruction and claiming innocent lives, a menace fast becoming one of the dominant causes of mortality in Sri Lanka. Newspapers devote mammoth space to delve on the agendas of leading personalities vying to grab power. There is extensive reporting on various acts of mala fide committed by many in and an out of the body politic aspiring to reach pinnacle of political office, that goes counter to the principles of good governance and rule of law. There are allegations and counter allegations and finger-pointing smacking of wheeling and dealing. Obviously there is much more than what meets the common mans eyes, as he is mostly kept in the dark on closed door machinations. 
How much of space time and effort are devoted by media on matters of substance that enrich the lives of people is no-brainer. Have institutions of media become selectively partisan in approach, or if media are serving with discrimination as mouthpieces of a coterie of powerful shelving core responsibility to be the voice of the voiceless is a question raise. 

"People have to cough up more out of meager incomes to pay multitude of taxes and levies to finance mounting debt burdens occasioned by financial sins committed by political masters"
There is general decline in the standard of discipline across the society with noble human traits like morality, empathy, camaraderie that have kept people closely knit for centuries seem to be fading away, whilst lack of tolerance, empathy and fellow feeling are witnessing an unprecedented rise. There is a marked propensity towards brutalization of human conduct as witnessed in everyday occurrences involving harmful acts. Any unintentional misstep, slip, or oversight due to whatever reason seldom passes without evoking disproportionately harsher rebuke irrespective of what causes it.
For example, behaviour of motorists particularly three-wheeler drivers is a case in point. There is absolute no discipline on the part of motorists particularly omnibus and three-wheeler drivers. This is only the tip of the iceberg. This country is seeing growing political turmoil and break-down and issues in multitude of sectors from educations, law enforcement and energy to health.
There is agitation all over and everyone is demanding his/her pound of flesh. Everyone from public sector employees, professionals like Doctors, University Lecturers, and School Teachers to young undergraduates is agitating. They often end up in clashes and violent demonstrations disrupting the day to day lives and resulting in severe economic losses. The phenomenon of escalating non-tolerance is noticeable in a whole gamut of sectors and spheres. 
There is fishing in troubled waters by opportunists in the garbs of body politic to derive mileage wherever possible. They spew venom as they please for their own benefits. The ultimate goal being grabbing power at any cost that paves the way to achieve other selfish ends in an endless cycle of events.
