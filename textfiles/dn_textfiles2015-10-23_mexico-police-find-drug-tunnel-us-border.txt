Mexico police find drug tunnel at US border

US: Mexican police have found an 800-metre (half-mile) long tunnel used by a gang to sneak drugs from Tijuana to the California city of San Diego, authorities said Thursday.
The federal officers detained 16 suspects and seized 10 tonnes of marijuana in Wednesday's operation in a warehouse, the National Security Commission said in a statement.
The 10-metre (33-foot) deep tunnel had tracks to transport the narcotics on a platform-like car, a ventilation system and lights.
After a weeks-long investigation, police moved in after seeing an "intense movement" of trucks going in and out of the warehouse, "apparently to leave drugs" bound for the United States, the statement said.
The police operation was conducted "without firing a single shot, surprising the suspected drug smugglers," it said.
Most of the suspects were between the ages of 21 and 50 and were from the northwestern state of Sinaloa.
They told investigators that they packed and shipped drugs and had links with a criminal group based in the western state of Jalisco, the statement said.
Drug cartels have been shipping drugs to the United States through sophisticated underground tunnels for years.- AFP
