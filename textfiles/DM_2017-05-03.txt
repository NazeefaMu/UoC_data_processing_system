A present to suit a fairy  tale birthday party
	

A story buzzing in political circles these days says that a politico from the Puttalam area has given a staggeringly expensive birthday present to his granddaughter.

This astounding present is a Benz car worth a hefty Rs.40 million.
This politico functioned as a state purohita for some time under yahapalanaya and quit office lamenting that he had not been given even an official vehicle befitting his status.
A large number of guests had attended this birthday party painstakingly organized to appear as a scene from a fairy tale popular among children, they say.

A staggering fine
	

The party leadership had imposed a heavy fine on several senior purohitas: Rs.5 million each as their share towards the partys May Day expenses.

The other purohitas too had been asked to pay a fine, but it is an amount they could easily afford, they say.
So the unhappy seniors had gone into a hush-hush several times to discuss how they could raise enough dough to meet the fine, they say.

Answer was well written on his face
	

A prominent Buddhist monk residing in Narahenpita area, on a request by a high political authority called on him at his palace in the city the other day. This monk is well known as a loyal supporter of the former strongman.

Civilities over, the political authority broached the subject of the future of the Blue party now in turmoil. He also explained that the future of the country too was at stake due to the crisis in the Blue party.
After convincing the monk of the gravity of the developing situation, the bigwig requested him to undertake the mission of conveying a peace message containing several proposals to the former strongman.
The message to be delivered also emphasized the point that the party would have no future unless the two warring factions united to continue as a one single entity and also reminded the former strongman of a promise already held out to him: that he would be elevated to a very high office in the country if he opted to quit politics.
As the former strongman was on a tour in Rajarata, the monk helicoptered there to meet him given the urgency of the matter.
After warmly welcoming the loyal monk, the former strongman gave an attentive ear to the political high authoritys message being unfolded before him.
The monk carefully read the changing facial expressions of the former strongman as he was narrating the message.
By the time he finished explaining the message, the monk had read the answer well written on the former strongmans face. And without further ado, he flew back to Colombo to report the failure of his peace mission, they say.

Battle of acne Is it really worth fighting
	
There is no person under the sun who has never developed a bump on the face sometime in their life, due to reasons such as stress, hormonal changes close to menstrauation, oily food or chocolates. What if your face decides to freak out on the morning of your school party Thanks to make-up and concealing creams, you will probably be able to hide them. But what if cameras penetrate through all those foundation creams and make-up bases to highlight your pink bumps or dark scars
How much do acne and dark scars affect self-esteem and confidence
It is not surprising at all to know that acne could have a huge impact on our psyche as well as social habits, giving rise to avoidance of social interaction, insecurity and self-effacement.
You know what
It can be really comfortable to sit in a corner giving a wide berth to people around you, but will you be able to do this forever This is a defence mechanism to deal with the anxiety you might have developed due to your pockmarked face. Feeling confident despite all these imperfections will definitely take some time, but will be worth it in the end. Changing your thinking will result in numerous positive changes in your life. 
How can we boost our confidence and self-esteem without letting a few pink bumps affect our happiness 
Is picking acne helpful
No! Did you know that popping this particular type of pimple known as a cyst or hormonal acne could result in permanent scarring which can become discoloured, dark and unsightly According to dermatologists, this is the commonest form of acne which will scar easily and is difficult to treat. 

Visit a dermatologist
Meeting a specialist in the field completely changed my life says Dilakshi, 25. 
Being a lady doctor who is a known expert in treating acne taught me many lessons in life and not only defined the treatment but in general, my entire life altered with inner peace and confidence, General Physician Dr. H.M. Jayaweera said. 
The change should start from within
First of all, accept yourself for who you are. Then the mind-body connection will take place. There are many people who have gotten rid of acne permanently and sticking to a form of therapy involving a positive attitude, emotional upliftment and external medication will have good results. Medication will do its part if you try your level best to enhance the power of the inner self. According to the latest research studies, feeling good on the inside has a beneficial effect on ones immunity, thereby increasing the quality and rate of healing.  Topical antibiotics, hydrating applications and vitamin supplements play a major role in treating acne. In cases that dont respond to these treatments, acne can be managed effectively with surgical interventions like cauterization, where the cosmetic surgeon or dermatologist will poke at the scars with a needle charged with a mild electric current.

In addition to the therapeutic interventions, it is very important to keep yourself clean and hygienic- select a mild face wash which wont harm your skin (baby soap is perfect), get rid of dandruff- potentially a causative agent for facial acne- and live a relaxed life, avoiding stress and anxiety.It will take some time for the treatment to work, based on how severe your condition is.
The point is dont ever keep your feelings all bundled up - Just let them out! In fact dont let anxiety, stress and tension overthrow you and ruin your inner peace, as these can affect how the treatments work.
Fighting acne is worth it but even if you lose the battle, it doesnt matter, because beauty comes from within and perfection cant beat the beauty of imperfection!

Botox From a toxin to a beauty must-have
	

Beauty, appearance and looks are aspects that people worry a great deal about in todays society. Irrespective of gender, age or culture, good looks have become a trait that determines the survival of the fittest. While there are numerous ways in which one could look good, administering Botox tops the list. Botox is a medication used as a local injection and a protein produced by the Clostridium Botulinum bacteria. This was identified back in 1820 and in 1987, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), a federal agency of the United States Department of Health and Human Services, approved its medical usage in the USA. From there on, this medication was used in various fields, in more than 20 medical indications from cosmetics to neurology, ophthalmology and many others. Speaking to the Mirror Health Capsule, Dr. Chameera Bandara, Eye Plastic Surgeon (Oculoplasty) at the Colombo Eye Hospital elaborated on the action of Botox, its uses as well as side-effects. 
Q Could you elaborate on the action of Botox
Botox brings about relaxation of muscles and helps in reducing the over-secretion of products in certain glands including tear and sweat glands. Therefore Botox is used to relax overactive muscles. 
Q For what purposes is it used
Botox is used for cosmetic purposes and widely used for non-cosmetic reasons to treat diseases with facial spasms, involuntary movements in limbs, deformities due to stroke, muscle problems or cerebral palsy, migraines, some genito-urinary problems and many more. 
In terms of cosmetic purposes, Botox is mainly used to treat facial wrinkles and is also used to reshape selected facial features. Facial wrinkles are most prominent around the eyes. Wrinkles form because muscles in the face are constantly used to create facial expressions. Certain facial expressions bring about dynamic wrinkles, seen in young or middle aged people. These dynamic wrinkles eventually become static wrinkles in elderly people due to constant muscle activity and due to loss of the skins elasticity. Once static wrinkles develop, its difficult to get rid of them. Therefore wrinkles are best treated in their dynamic stage and this can be achieved easily by relaxing relevant facial muscles using Botox. Botox is also used for reshaping purposes in the case of fine shaping the eyelids, brows and lips and for other requirements in the upper and lower face. 
Q How effective is this injection
The action of Botox is not permanent and will last for about four to six months. After this time, the facelifts that have been done gradually return to their previous state and then re-injection of Botox needs to be considered. 
Q In Sri Lanka for what purpose(s) is (are) Botox used and what is the likelihood that someone would use it for cosmetic purposes
Botox is widely used for medical purposes and the disadvantage is that it is expensive. Since its effectiveness is limited to a certain duration it has to be administered repeatedly. People dont have much knowledge about this injection but in urban areas theres an increasing tendency for people to take Botox to enhance their looks. Due to the lack of awareness of local availability, people tend to go abroad and get the treatment. 
Q What are the side-effects one could experience when using Botox
There are no serious side-effects as long it is injected to the right place in right dosage. Therefore, if Botox is injected into a wrong muscle, there will be side-effects but they will never be permanent. 
Another important fact that I should mention is that Botox cannot be purchased over the counter and should be administered by a medical professional. 
Botox is used for children as well so people dont have to have fear using it.

Constitutional draft, a sugar-coated poison: Udaya
	
The Constitutional draft which is being made is sugar-coated poison and no one should fall for it, Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) General Secretary MP Udaya Gammanpila said today.
Commenting on a recent interim report of the Constitutional Assemblys Steering Committee, the MP said it had put forward a number of proposals which are detrimental to the unitary character of Sri Lanka.
The interim report had been submitted to the Constitutional Assembly by the Prime Minister as the Constitutional Assemblys Steering Committee Head. The reforms are only unitary in name but federal in function. Therefore, we should make people aware of this danger to nip it in the bud, he said.
Addressing a news briefing alongside with National Freedom Front (NFF) Leader Wimal Weerawansa on the constitutional reforms, MP Gammanpila said they would create a broad front to defeat the constitutional trap which is ahead of the country.
Elaborating on the report, he said the proposals on the place given to Buddhism from the Constitution were contradictory.
Meanwhile, he said powerful countries like the US, China and India which like to get hold of resources of Sri Lanka would prefer it divided into separate administrations so that they could get their objectives completed easily. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Controversial missile  defence  shield operational in South Korea
	

A U.S. antimissile defence system recently installed in South Korea is now operational, a U.S. official said Monday, in the latest sign of an enhanced U.S. response to threats from North Korea. 
The official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss military operations overseas, said the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, or THAAD, an American-made system to intercept and destroy ballistic missiles, had reached initial operating capability. 
The U.S. militarys installation of the THAAD battery in South Korea has been hotly contested. China considers the system a threat to its own security, while critics in South Korea allege that the United States is scrambling to set up the system before that country can hold a presidential election that might lead to a decision to halt its use altogether. 
The scrutiny of the THAAD installation, which has been under discussion with Seoul for years, reflects heightened tensions over North Koreas ballistic missile and nuclear programmes. 
Today the THAAD system has taken on new urgency for the United States as South Korea approaches its May 9 election. The leading candidate in that race has said he would review the previous governments acceptance of THAAD. 
Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, Trumps national security adviser, suggested Sunday that the United States might in the future ask South Korea to reimburse the United States for at least some of the THAAD system.

GMOA Secretary Naveen De Soyza told a media briefing that they had informed the President that the government should provide a firm response to this matter.
We are insisting that SAITM be nationalized and the government should refrain from entering into trade agreements with foreign countries such as that of the Economic and Technology Cooperation Agreement (ETCA) which many deprive Sri Lankans of job opportunities, he said adding that the government should stop selling the country's assets and the privatization of state institutions.
Dr. De Soyza said some 160 trade unions including those of teachers, the transport sector and the railways would join them in this battle which would continue if these matters are not resolved. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said today the Cabinet had not taken any decision to set up a special army unit and that the President was the head of the security forces according to the law.
He said this in response to a question asked by JVP MP Vijitha Herath on the controversy over the appointment of Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka as a head of the security forces.
"Field Marshal Fonseka has experience working as an army commander. The President and myself have admired his contribution both in the Cabinet and outside. We do not intend setting up any special army unit. We use the security forces only to safeguard the country's sovereignty and security," the Prime Minister said.
MP Herath said Cabinet Spokesman Rajitha Senaratne had categorically stated that the President had requested SF to take up a post in the security forces.
The Prime Minister said he could not reveal what was discussed at the Cabinet meeting except the decisions taken by it.

How can I reduce migraines
	

Q I am a 22-year-old female and I occasionally get these headaches on one side of my head. I feel a pounding in my head and pressure in my eyes as well as nausea. I have been going through this from a very young age and have never taken any medication for it. Is there anything I could do to reduce how often I get this or is it a condition I should get checked by a doctor (Thisaari Gunewardana)

Most likely it is a migraine, however, in a classical migraine the pain can shift sides. Since you are getting it on one side, it is definitely better to have it checked by a doctor. As it is a long standing condition, you should get a proper diagnosis by going to a neurologist.
Migraines are common and are made worse by certain foods like chocolate, peanuts and other nuts. If you are fasting for a long period, stress and sleep deprivation can cause it. If your parents or grandparents also suffer from migraines, then it could be hereditary.
You can take paracetamol to relieve the pain but once it has been diagnosed by a physician or a neurologist, a tablet will be prescribed to prevent an attack for about six months. In addition to that, when you get an attack there are tablets that can be prescribed, in addition to pain killers, if pain killers do not work.
Although the most probable diagnosis is a migraine, it could also be sinusitis or a tumour (but as it has been going on for so long it is unlikely), it could also be tension or a problem with your eyesight, maybe an eye sprain, because this can precipitate migraines.
To avoid or reduce the number of migraines you get, take measures such as reducing your intake of coffee and chocolate, getting proper sleep and engaging in meditation. When you are in the sun, wear sunglasses.

The leaders of the political party with a popular base in the North-East had set the ball rolling when they decided at a recent closed door meeting to oust the incumbent Vig who turned renegade after winning the coveted office with their blessings.
The party leaders had also reached agreement to field as their candidate a radical already holding a seat in Diyawanna council.
The party big guns have taken into consideration that they would have no problem about marketing the new face among the people in the North as the latter has close ties with several media institutions in the country.

REUTERS, 02nd MAY, 2017- North Korea accused the United States on Tuesday of pushing the Korean peninsula to the brink of nuclear war after a pair of strategic U.S. bombers flew training drills with the South Korean and Japanese air forces in another show of strength.

The two supersonic B-1B Lancer bombers were deployed amid rising tensions over North Koreas pursuit of its nuclear and missile programmes in defiance of U.N. sanctions and pressure from the
United States.
The flight of the two bombers on Monday came as U.S. President Donald Trump said he would be honoured to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in the right circumstances, and as his CIA director landed in South Korea for talks.
South Korean Defence Ministry spokesman Moon Sang-gyun told a briefing in Seoul that Mondays joint drill was conducted to deter provocations by the North.

Prison Healthcare: A right to be denied or protected
	
Access to healthcare in prisons is often looked at with scepticism due to the rather bleak picture the very thought of prisons offer. Prisons are often thought of as dungeons where infections are rampant. There is concern that prisoners are poorly fed and are affected by the uncleanliness and overcrowding of prison cells. Though prisoners are imprisoned for a certain violation on their part, authorities should not take it upon themselves to violate prisoners rights by depriving them of basic necessities. The WHO Constitution enshrines that the highest attainable standard of health as a fundamental right of every human being. Deprivation of freedom in the form of imprisonment does not imply that health care should be denied.  Dr. Naim Ismail attached to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and who has been working in Sri Lanka for nearly two years as a detention doctor and project manager firmly believes that humane treatment for prisoners include access to health care which is at the same level of health care available for the people in the community who are not detained. Thushara Upuldeniya, the Prisons Media Spokesman said that as Sri Lanka was a developing country there were difficulties in maintaining international standards. But we provide all facilities so that the health of inmates is not affected. Prison health is under the purview of the Health Ministry. Therefore all facilities found in a normal hospital are provided to the prison hospital, he added.

Public Health
Stressing on the importance of prison health care Dr.Ismail said that it was important as a human rights, legal, public health and moral issue. Focusing on public health he noted that it was important to ensure that inmates detained by the government were not exposed to higher risks because of their detention. People who are detained lose their freedom and are not able to take care of themselves, so the state has to take care of them. In prisons people are at a risk of many illnesses. Eventually they will go to the community. There are also visits by family members and they are in contact with the staff, guards and doctors in the prison. So the spread of disease among prisoners is not only bad for prisoners themselves but also the whole country. Health in the prison is important for the health of the nation, he said. 

Infrastructure
Dr.Ismail has been visiting places of detention in Sri Lanka to observe their health conditions and discuss ways of improving their condition with the relevant authorities. Pointing out weaknesses in our health services he said the infrastructure was very poor as the prisons were old. This makes it difficult to have good sanitation and it affects health. You dont see well-equipped consultation rooms inside prisons. In the Mahara prison the ICRC supported the government to construct three new consultation rooms and one space for a basic laboratory. They used to have only one consultation room which made it very difficult for doctors to do their job effectively. Now they are able to treat their patients and attend to their needs as soon as possible without waiting in long lines. There will not be overcrowded clinics, where three or four patients talk to the doctor at the same time, and where patients cannot talk about confidential needs, he said adding that in the Colombo remand prison two consultation rooms were complete and consultation rooms in the Outpatients Departemt (OPD) of the prison hospital was being refurbished. 

Water and sanitation
Speaking about sanitation Dr.Ismail said that it was important to note whether inmates had access to toilets all day long, whether the toilets functioned and can be flushed all the time. Sometimes there are toilets but if the inmates are locked during the night, and have no access, then they are useless.The Prisons Media Spokesman added that Prisoners have access to toilets all day and that there are toilets in the cell and in premises. 

Maintaining Health Records
Dr. Ismail further pointed out that health information was not collected effectively to be analyzed and used in making decisions. Health information can be collected in a better way, analyzed and used by the decision makers of the Ministry of health to prioritize health issues, identify the needs and provide resources, he said adding that when authorities were not aware of the needs action taken may or may not address the actual issue. Proper action requires information. Well informed decisions are better than non-informed decisions, he added. 
However Upuldeniya stated that there was no issue in maintaining health records. Doctors of the prison hospital maintain health records. There is no issue here. When it comes to diseases such as Tuberculosis health records are maintained even after the prisoners are released, he noted. 

Nutrition
Speaking about nutrition Dr.Ismail said that adequate food with sufficient amount of calories including all the elements of food should be provided. If they are working inside prisons they should be getting more calories. If they are sick they should be given proper food that is prescribed by the doctor, he said. 
Upuldeniya said that prison authorities were not allowed to provide food based on their choice, and should obey the standing orders of the Prison Department which stipulate the types of food that should be provided. We cant change these. The person in charge of sections should be satisfied by what is being provided. Then there are PHIs to inspect the quality of the food. There are also independent bodies such as the Prison welfare Association and the Prison Visitors committee appointed by the Minister, to report on any issue they come across, he stressed. 

Illnesses in prisons
Dr.Ismail said that in most countries people were more sick in prisons than in the community due to mental health problems, and infections such as Tuberculosis and scabies. 
When they come to the prison they become more sick because of overcrowding and because there are a lot of sick people already. They are deprived of freedom and they dont have access to good food or exercise, he said.  Dr. Ismail said that each prison should have a doctor or nurse visiting or resident in the prison to identify those who are sick and provide them with treatment. Every prisoner must get a health screening during the course of the first 24hrs after admission to identify any kind of illnesses, injuries, mental health problems, or drug abuse problems and to prescribe treatment accordingly, he added. 
In Sri Lanka the responsibility of providing doctors falls under the purview of the Ministry of Health. Dr. Priyantha Athapattu, the Acting Director of Prison health care services and the Director of Medical services said that prison doctors are required to screen prisoners though it did not take place to an optimum level. However he noted that there was a pilot project underway to cater to this problem. 

Overcrowding
Prison overcrowding is an acute problem that affects our prison system. The Welikada prison was proposed to be shifted last year to address the issue of overcrowding. Overcrowding is a problem worldwide and it is always not a good news for health. It is very difficult to protect and prevent illnesses. If you have ten people in one room in your home, its not going to be very healthy. If someone gets sick everyone gets sick. It is the same in prisons, Dr. Ismail explained. 
Raising health concerns related to overcrowding Dr. Ismail said that prisoners mental health would also be affected.
Violence is more. If you have one doctor for thousand detainees then its not good. Access to toilets, water, food and everything becomes more difficult. Security also becomes tough, he added. 
Thushara Upuldeniya, the Prisons Media Spokesman
Mental Health
Speaking about mental health Dr. Ismail said that in many instances, in place of being admitted to hospitals the mentally sick were found in prisons. Even if you are healthy your mental health will suffer. If your mental health is already poor prisons is the worse place to be, he said. 
Suggesting recommendations to improve the mental health of detainees he said that they should be involved in meaningful activities which could be either entertainment, sport, art, work, productions, or going to the outside yard instead of sitting in the cell all day. He added that it was also important to treat prisoners humanely, and not humiliate them. It is important to ensure that they have access to health care, food, air, recreational activities, which all contribute towards mental health. 
The Prisons Media Spokesperson said that there were recreational activities in all prisons, which prisoners had access to. He explained, however, that the recreational activities depended on whether the inmates were high security or low security detainees and also on the period they were to be detained for. 
Dr. Athapattu said that the Ministry of Health with the support of the National Institute of Mental Health has appointed a consultant to visit the Welikada prison at least two or three days a month, while Medical Officers of Mental Health have been requested to visit prisons at least once a week in other districts. 

"Ideally each prisoner should have easy access to the prison clinic when they fall sick. There should be an initial health screening of all inmates at admission within 24hrs"

Female inmates welfare
The United Nations Rules for the Treatment of Women Prisoners and Non-custodial Measures for Women Offenders (the Bangkok Rules) were adopted by the UN General Assembly in December 2010. According to Dr. Ismail they provide guidelines for the treatment and needs of women and their accompanying children. Most of the prisons are designed for men, and not women. So when women are in the prison their needs are sometimes not addressed. Providing sanitation material for women is an example, he said. 
Speaking about pregnant inmates he said that their needs should be adequately addressed as specified in the Bangkok rules.  A pregnant woman needs more calories and food. They need more access to health care. In the first trimester they need access to a gynaecologist, who should be a woman and not a man, once a month. In the last couple of months a gynaecologist should examine them every two weeks. When the time of delivery is known they should be sent to the hospital. No baby should be delivered in prisons, he said. When asked about how pregnant women delivered their babies Upuldeniya said that though they were under the surveillance of prison officials, they were taken to government hospitals, so that they could obtain equal health facilities available for any citizen. Further, Dr. Athapattu said that there were national guidelines put forth by the Family Health Bureau of the Ministry of Health which are followed in prisons. Usually we give the basic recommendations. If the recommendation of a specialist is required a request can be made by the Chief Medical Officer to the prison health department to take the pregnant woman for specialist treatment, he said.  Dr. Ismail explained that once the baby is delivered and if the family decided that the baby should be with the mother, the government was in obligation to provide everything needed for the baby. Although the baby is not a prisoner, they should provide everything including milk, food, vaccination and clothing, he added. According to Upuldeniya children until the age of five were allowed to be with the mother after court approval is obtained. He also said that there were day care centres for accompanying children in prisons.

Responsibility of Prison Doctors
Stressing on the responsibility of doctors to be very respectful and strictly observe medical ethics Dr.Ismail said that though outside patients had the option of consulting any doctor, there was no such choice available to prisoners. If the patient(prisoner) stops trusting this doctor he has no other choice, he said.  Dr. Athapattu, stressing that health is a human right said that doctors should not differentiate between prisoners and outside patients, but administer treatment that can be provided within the prison system. Speaking about the adequacy of doctors he said that there was an issue at the Welikada prison as the doctors have been transferred following certain events. He also pointed out that the Department of Prisons was responsible to supply nurses. Its a joint responsibility of the Ministry of Health and Ministry of Prison Reforms to provide medical services. Therefore we try to provide nurses who are willing to work there. But the provision of nursing officers totally lies with the Department of Prisons, he added. 

Universal Health Insurance
Prison health care is provided by the Ministry of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine. Praising the universal health insurance available in Sri Lanka, Dr. Ismail said it was a great strength of Sri Lanka that prison health care is covered free of charge by the universal health insurance. They are entitled by the law to health care as any citizen. So the law is on their side. It is not like this in other countries, he said. 

In an ideal prison system how should the health care system work
Dr. Ismail said that in an ideal situation every prison should be well equipped and staffed with doctors and nurses. Based on the population of the prison this could be part time or full time, one day per week, every day or two to three doctors per day. Ideally each prisoner should have easy access to the prison clinic when they fall sick. There should be an initial health screening of all inmates at admission within 24hrs, he added.  He added that the prison doctors should be able to refer a prisoner to an outside hospital if the available resources were not sufficient. This should be organized and managed in collaboration with the security staff who would escort the prisoners. Ideally medicine should be provided free of charge, he said.

Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekera said today the Court ruling unseating Geetha Kumarasinghe from her seat in Parliament could be a problem for several other MPs as well.
This question can crop up for several others as well. This is an important verdict. This is the first time that such a verdict was given in Sri Lanka unseating an MP. This ruling may pose problems for several other MPs as well should an appeal in the Supreme Court results in the SC confirming the lower court ruling, he told the weekly SLFP media briefing at the party headquarters.
UPFA General Secretary and Minister, Mahinda Amaraweera said this such a ruling was made possible under the 19th amendment which approved by the members of parliament. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

The decision taken by the JO leadership to field the big-mouthed lady from the Gem City area as their chief ministerial candidate at the upcoming provincial polls has raised the hackles of practically all JO Diyawanna members from the district.

The former strongman has received reports that Soy Aiya, Kumbura malli and Choka malli are up in arms against the decision.
Meanwhile, the lady under siege has complained that a senior character is also secretly supporting the rebellion against her.
However, this lady, a typical Amazon, has dug in for a last pitched battle, they say.

Supawamsaya chronicles: The Chef, Sri Lanka unmatched in quality and creativity
	
Sri Lankan cuisine- By renowned chef Pabilis Silva

Renowned Chef Pabilis Silva, who brought about a culinary revolution in the country built on the traditional food taste, published the book Mahasupavamsaya with a detailed account of Sri Lankas cuisine. Supavamsaya is expected to be revised at regular intervals with the addition of new chapters on the latest development of Sri Lankas culinary affairs. In an interview with Daily Mirror, Mr. Silva outlines the reasons for him to compose this book and uniqueness of the countrys food and cooking ingredients.
The excerpts of the interview: 

	Sri Lankan cuisine is unmatched by any
	
	
	Sri Lankans only use vegetariancooking ingredients
	

What are the reasons for you to undertake this task
I explored information. I studied some archaeological excavations. I interacted with those academics who were involved in such excavations. I travelled through 29 countries and studied their food cultures. Mahasupavamsaya is a result of all
these activities. 
When analyzing the food culture, we have to bear in mind that humans originated in Africa, and then migrated to the rest of the world. I started my task in 1968. All edibles on our soil have herbal properties. The humans emerged in Africa. They consumed raw meat in the primitive stage. Then, how did they start cooking meat I was curious to find it using my culinary skills. I gave serious mind to it. In cooking food, fire and water are fundamentally needed. We discovered fire by accident. When early humans needed fire, they experimented the generation of it through various means  by pressing two pieces of rock or wood. If not for that, they should have depended on bushfire. In that prehistoric era, humans would have fled for safety in the event of a bushfire. Otherwise, animals and some of them would have been caught in fire and been charred. When survivors returned, they would have found everything charred. There was nothing left for consumption other than charred animal remains. Out of no choice, they devoured charred remains to find a developed taste. It was easy to snap off chunks and chunks of flesh off charred carcasses. This is the origin of cooking food using fire. That happened by accident in this manner. 


"We use 42 cooking ingredients containing properties with herbal value. Ours is exclusive because we do not use ingredients which are artificial or made of animal oil"

Then, I asked myself how cooking ingredients came about. I also had my own experience during my teen age. As a teenager born to a family without land and any other property, I, along with others, used to snap off young coconut from palms in nearby gardens and eat. That is a mischievous act. Once, a piece of coconut dropped from my hand on the sandy beach near my house. I washed it with seawater. Amazingly, I had a different taste. Salt is the first cooking ingredient. It is a food savoury. Today, no food can be cooked or made without salt. We can disregard other ingredients, but not salt. In simple, fire, water and salt are basic requirements for cooking food. I had a great chance of travelling in Africa. I wanted to experience their food culture. I tasted some food prepared for me. It is a sticky food. They called it pup. It is nothing but what we call Thalapa. Theirs was made of wheat flour. We have Kurakkan Thalapa. You can notice how the food cultures are inter-related. In Sri Lanka, we had agriculture even in 9th century BC. We had cultivated cotton. After the arrival of Prince Vijeya, there was erosion of the original indigenous culture. In my book, I have extensively dealt with how food culture eroded after the arrival of Prince Vijeya. We have embraced alien food cultures since then. 
It will be revised every two years with the inclusion of new chapters detailing out developments in our culinary sphere. Like Mahawamsa, it will continue to be chronicled by the generations to come. We have published the pictures of all food stuffs grown on this soil. Also included are the photos of all edible fish varieties grown in seawater and freshwater. One can find details about all our traditional yam and fruit varieties in the book published recently. 
You said you studied the food cultures of 29 countries. What is the uniqueness of the Sri Lankanfood culture
Our food culture is unmatched by any. It is unique. We have to prove it. We use 42 cooking ingredients containing properties with herbal value. Ours is exclusive because we do not use ingredients which are artificial or made of animal oil. In other countries, animal oil or fat is also used. 
"After the importation of sugar and wheat, it made a lethal health blow to our people. We inherited non communicable diseases. As for Kavum, we cannot, in fact, trace its origin other than going by some hear-say"
What is the reason for it inyour view
It may be due to our religious inclinations. We are Buddhists. With the advent of Buddhism after the arrival of Arahat Mahinda, the country underwent a major social transformation. 
How did the use of cooking ingredients evolve over the years
We talked about how we started cooking. In Ayurveda, we find great historic details. This appears to have developed in conformity with such Ayurvedic concepts. When we are sick, we brew some corriander seeds in hot water and drink it. We use cinnamon as a herb for lowering the sugar level in the body. Around 150 years ago, we used Kaluduru as an ingredient. My view is that we derived the use of cooking ingredients from Ayurveda. 
Some people say that Sri Lankan cuisine is not that elaborate. What is your view
Our indigenous food culture suffered after the arrival of Prince Vijeya. Later, our country was invaded by foreign powers. We inherited some food varieties from those invaders. Our indigenous identity was lost. Today, chilli paste has become an essential component for some when taking their meals. On a festive occasion, our people tend to make sure that Chopsuey is available. They try to have fried rice somehow. They do not know the meaning of it though. They mistakenly call vegetable rice fried rice. We embraced alien cuisine casting aside ours. I think this happened after the Portuguese and British invasion. Some of our people compromised their identity for the sake of titles conferred. 
Today, Sri Lankan society has got addicted to fast food, disregarding traditional cuisine. What areyour views
That is a good question. At village level, we have traditional family functions to mark weddings or events of girls attaining age. We also conduct ritualistic ceremonies. We normally make two or three vegetable curries on such occasions to host guests and relatives. We are used to fry Papadam. In the past, we mostly made Kiribath and Kavum. With the arrival of the Portuguese, it changed. We started making cake even for birthdays. What we lost is our traditional food culture. 
Eating cake on birthdays is not our culture. We have embraced it from elsewhere. We only ate Kiribath and Kavum. We have heard of Kiribath made by Sujatha to be offered to the Buddha prior to his attainment of Buddha-hood. She made it with fresh milk. That is the history of Kiribath we can think of. Whenever there is any almsgiving at a village household, fellow villagers contribute to it with various food stuffs. This practice is always there. 
Today, we notice criticism even about our traditional sweetmeats prepared for Aluth Avurudu. It is said these items are too oily and sugary, and therefore not good for health. What is your view
It is unfounded criticism. We did not have either sugar or wheat for preparing sweetmeats. In fact, we imported them. After the importation of sugar and wheat, it made a lethal health blow to our people. We inherited non communicable diseases. As for Kavum, we cannot, in fact, trace its origin other than going by some hear-say. Kavum, Kiribath and Kokis are traditional sweetmeats. Kokis is not ours. Aasmi is yet another sweetmeat introduced to us. However, only we have Aasmi today, in the whole world. It is not found elsewhere in the world.

"On a festive occasion, our people tend to make sure that Chopsuey is available. They try to have fried rice somehow. They do not know the meaning of it though. They mistakenly call vegetable rice fried rice. We embraced alien cuisine casting aside ours. I think this happened after the Portuguese and British invasion. Some of our people compromised their identity for the sake of titles conferred"

Sweet Tooth
	

By Sanjaya Eramudugoda 
If you have a sweet tooth, you will like eating sweet foods, especially sweets and chocolate. People have a craze to eat sweets. Despite a need to reduce the intake of sugar-based food, it is a difficult task to curb ones greed for sweets. 
However, this desire can be somewhat controlled by reducing the intake of additional sugar. This wont be completely effective but if you follow a systematic plan, you can get rid of a reasonable amount of excess calories from your food. 

Saying no to sweetened drinks
A considerable amount of sugar enters our body through sweetened, carbonated and fruit drinks. Consider the amount of sugar entering our body through soft drinks, tea, coffee and flavoured milk. It is much better to drink water instead of turning to these drinks. If you desire something flavourful, make lemon, lime or orange juice. If you think you cannot avoid drinking beverages like tea and coffee, take them with less sugar and cut down on the number of times such drinks are taken. 

Bid goodbye to artificial additives
Artificial sweeteners used as alternatives to sugar may appear to be one way to get rid of sugar addiction. However, artificial sweeteners being able to rid the body of excess fat has not been proven scientifically. As these artificial sweeteners too are very sweet, addiction to sugar will increase. This has been proven through various research. 

Eat with a clear mind
Always stop to think before you develop a craving to eat or drink something containing sugar. Is the craving a result of hunger or is it due to mental stress Examine the reasons for this craving. Then it will be easier to control your food intake. Taking a short walk or having a conversation with a friend will help you overcome your desire for sweets. In addition, while having meals, concentrate on the meal and do not allow your mind to wander. This will allow you to enjoy the taste of your food and get over the need to have something sweet. 

Always be awareof sugar contentin foods
When purchasing food and drink, always get into the habit of reading the labels. This will help you have an idea about its nutritional value and natural content. If any label on a food or a drink product indicates that the sugar content is over 8g or that additional sugar has been added, it is better to put this back on the rack. If the sugar content is not indicated on the label of an item, it is evident that this item has no added sugar and therefore you need not worry. 
Our bodies respond differently to natural sugar compared to added sugar. Additional sweeteners contain sucrose, dextrose, sorbitol, manitol, honey, agave plant extract, dextrin, moltodextrine, corn syrup with excessive fructose and other syrups. If any base material ends with ose or ol it contains sugar. Sucrose is identified as an alternative to sugar. 

Get used tonatural foods
It is about time we realised that life does not revolve around how much sugar we consume. Fresh fruits or dried fruits with natural sweetness, unsweetened yoghurt, grains with the bran intact and vegetables should be consumed instead, to lead a healthy life. 
Further, these foods provide protein, vitamins, minerals and fibre, which are required by our bodies. These proteins are present in low content in sweet foods. The presence of proteins and fibre in our bodies makes food digest much slower, thereby regulating the sugar levels in our systems. This also prevents frequent hunger and limits the daily caloric requirement of our bodies. 
Therefore, it is time to say goodbye to sweet foods and give more preference to fruits, vegetables, grains and unsweetened yoghurt, for longevity.

Venezuelans block roads to protest Maduro constitution ploy
	

DAILY MAIL, 02nd MAY, 2017- Caracas residents blocked streets with trash bags, broken concrete and twisted metal Tuesday to protest the socialist presidents bid to rewrite the constitution amid a deepeningpolitical crisis.
Increasingly embattled President Nicolas Maduro signed a decree Monday to begin the process of rewriting the countrys charter. Opposition leaders immediately cried foul, calling the planned constitutional assembly a ploy to put off regional elections scheduled for this year and a presidential election that was to be held in 2018.
Polling has suggested the socialists would lose both those elections badly at a time of widespread anger over triple-digit inflation and shortages of food and other goods.

Was it an act of revenge
	

Seven to eight Blue party Diyawanna members associated with the JO group lost their Blue party organizer posts recently.

One of them happens to be a senior party member apart from being the eldest son of a founder member of the Blue party.
Some JO members were discussing this development when one of them came out with a little known incident which took most of them by surprise.
According to this story, the Dambulla politico was the first among the few party veterans who decided to extend unconditional support to the Compassionate One to establish yahapalanaya. He had also held a meeting of the party members in the district at his residence to canvass their support for the new leader.
However, the Dambulla politico had got disenchanted with yahapalanaya after a brief association with it and got closer to the former strongman thereafter.
The JO member who traced these antecedent events, told his colleagues that he believed the Dambulla politico was ousted from his organizer post as an act of revenge for teaming up with the former strongman.

When Pets are a problem
	

By Janani Angammana
If you have pets in your house, it may seem normal for children to sneeze or cough regularly. When should you start to worry about the possibility of a pet allergy Are pets harmful to your childs health This week we shed light on parenting dilemmas in relation to children and pets. Health Capsule spoke to Consultant Paediatrician Dr. Kosala Karunartne on how pet allergies should be dealt with. 
What is a pet allergy
A pet allergy is an immune reaction to animal dander (skin flakes), saliva, urine or faeces. An animals fur itself isnt much of an allergen but it can trap pollen, dust, mould and other allergens. When a child with pet allergy breathes in dander or comes into contact with saliva or droppings, his immune system goes on alert and releases Histamine and over 40 other chemicals to fight the allergen. This reaction can also be defined as an allergic reaction to proteins found in animals skin cells, saliva or urine. Signs of pet allergy include those common to hay fever, such as sneezing and runny nose. Some people may also experience signs of asthma, such as wheezing and difficulty breathing. 
Pet allergy signs and symptoms caused by inflammation of nasal passages include:
Sneezing 
	Runny nose 
	Itchy, red or watery eyes 
	Nasal congestion 
	Itchy noses roof of mouth and throat 
	Postnasal drip 
	Cough 
	Facial pressure and pain 
	Frequent awaking 
	Swollen, bluish skin under eyes 
	Frequent upward rubbing of the nose 
If the pet allergy contributes to asthma, you may also experience: 
Difficulty breathing 
	Chest tightness or pain 
	Audible whistling or wheezing 
	Sound of exhaling 
	Trouble sleeping, caused by shortness of breath or coughing 
	Skin symptoms
Some people with pet allergy may also experience skin symptoms, a pattern known as allergic dermatitis. 

Raised, red patches on skin 
	Eczema 
	Itchy skin 
Dr. Karunaratne explained, Children really love animals and being with animals is important to their development. If the child is allergic to pets, try to keep him away from animals as much as you can. Separating pets from children could benefit the physical well-being of the child but might have an impact if he/she has developed a bond with the animal. Take precautions such as limiting the time your child comes into contact with the pet. Making sure pets are kept away from the bedroom is another important safety precaution. Children love having pets on carpets and nowadays many keep their pets in bedrooms and even on beds, cuddling and hugging them.
If you can limit these habits, pet allergies can be reduced in kids. Other than cats and dogs, kids could also be allergic to birds, rabbits and rodents. 


How do allergies develop
Allergies occur when the immune system reacts to a foreign substance such as pollen, mould or pet dander. The immune system produces proteins known as antibodies. These antibodies protect the body from unwanted invaders that could make you sick or cause an infection. When you have allergies, your immune system creates antibodies that identify your particular allergen as something harmful, even though it isnt. 
When you inhale the allergen or come into contact with it, your immune system responds and produces an inflammatory response in your nasal passages or lungs. Prolonged or regular exposure to the allergen can cause the ongoing airway inflammation associated with asthma. 

Cats and Dogs
Allergen from cats and dogs are found in their shed skin cells as well as in their saliva, urine and fur. Dander is a particular problem because it is very small and can remain airborne for long periods of time, with the slightest bit of air circulation. It also accumulates on upholstered furniture and sticks to clothes. Pet saliva can stick to carpets, bedding, furniture and clothing. Dried saliva can become airborne. 

Rodents and Rabbits
Pet rodents include mice, gerbils, hamsters and guinea pigs. Allergens from rodents are usually present in their fur, dander, saliva and urine. Dust from the litter or sawdust in the bottom of the cages may contribute to airborne allergens from rodents. 

Birds
This allergy is usually associated with the skin, feathers or excrement of the bird. The bodys immune system produces immunoglobulin and histamine in response to contact with the allergen. The specific symptoms that can result vary considerably. 


Diagnosing a pet allergy
Sinus infections- Ongoing (chronic) inflammation of tissues in the nasal passages caused by pet allergy can obstruct the hollow cavities connected to your nasal passages (sinuses). These obstructions can make you more likely to develop bacterial infections of the sinuses, such as sinusitis. 
Asthma- People with asthma and pet allergy often have difficulty managing asthma symptoms. They may be at risk of asthma attacks that require immediate medical treatment or emergency care. 
Your doctor may suspect a pet allergy based on symptoms, an examination of your nose and responses to his or her questions. He or she may use a lit instrument to look at the condition of the lining of your nose. If you have a pet allergy, the lining of the nasal passage may be swollen or appear pale or bluish. 

Allergy skin test- In these tests, tiny amounts of purified allergen extracts, including those with animal proteins, is pricked from the skins surface. 
	Blood test- Screens the blood for specific allergies, looks for antibodies to various common allergens, including various animals.
