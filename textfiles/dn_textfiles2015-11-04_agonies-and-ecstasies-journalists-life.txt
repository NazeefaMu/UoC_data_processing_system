Agonies and ecstasies in a journalist's life

Triggering off from the standpoint of a lobby correspondent, it looks as if the former journalist attached to two Tamil newspapers Thinakaran and Weerakesari has thousand and one things to express. All this is about our good friend S Thiilainathan who had been working in the newsroom of the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation.
He is visualized as a multi faceted media person with a vast area of experience at home and abroad with a working ability in three languages English Sinhala and his mother tongue Tamil. Having commenced his media life as a lobby correspondent cum journalist at the age of eighteen he has managed to write some of his experiences in Sinhala in the latest book titled as Panasvasaraka Parlimentu Vartakaranaya (Fifty Years of Life as a Lobby Correspondent) but strangely enough the 45 short chapters in the work are not confined to a narrow field as a reporter. It transcends the barriers of a mere reporter and reaches the allied areas of communication and meeting various types people and visits to places and in addition to the facing of events which could be deemed sometimes as disastrous as well as challenging.
The work is packed with various types of incidents narrated in the form of fascinating mini narratives evoking the interest in the unwritten and so far written social history in 1962. He started his reporter career attached to the newspaper Virekesari. This starting point has been a blessed moment which had paved the way into many more avenues namely the career in the Davasa newspaper, Broadcasting corporation, the very first FM channel, advertising firms and culminating in Lake House.
Apart from these media units he had served as a member of the performance board and Presently as a member of the Director Board of Sri Lanka Press Council. He seems to feel that fifty two years have gone by leaving quite a lot of memories sweet and bitter. For the average reader these memoirs may look fantastic jottings and for the budding communicator and the student of mass communication they could well be wonderful series of lessons so far unheard of from a veteran in the field.
The communicator Thillainathan had had the chance of meeting some of the most popular politicians of the calibre of J R Jayewardene Dr N. M Perera R. Premadasa, Sirimavo Bandaranaike, Dr W Dahanayaka, K M P Rajaratne I M RA Eriyagolla, Tiruchelvam, Maithripala Senanayaka, Amirthalingam, Thondaman, M H Mohamed, Razik Fareed, William Gopallawa as well as Vijaya Kumaratunga to name a few.
He also states as a passing comment how he had the chance of getting to know some of the local and foreign films stars like MG Ramachandran and Saroja Devi to name two out of a galaxy of such personalities. Besides his work as a media communicator he had had the ability to comment on some of the latent social incidents of his career spanning to over fifty years. One such example is his encounter with Anton Balasingham as a writer and recalling of the dreadful Duraiappa case in Jaffna Then comes the citing of the bomb blasts that took place in various places of the country where he recounts and records the narrow escape he personally had from the bomb blast in the central bank building. It is more of a sensitive eye witness account of a devastating human tragedy.
This work of Thillainathan enables the reader to discern the need to know some of the forgotten significant events of the past that would help consider the worth of living in peace and harmony. He recalls the incident of the much discussed army parade held in Colombo where the Indian prime minister Rajiv Gandhi is said to have had a narrow escape from the rifle blow on the part of a local soldier destined to have severed all the possible political and other links that existed in the two countries at the time.
He too tries his best to recall some of the controversies that came to be known as historic legends such as the arrival of some of the members of the parliament by bullock carts dressed in loin cloths as a protest for the price hike of fuel and other commodities. He too tries to recall some of the events that mistook free flow of information which from the point of view of the ownership of private media companies and radio channels happened to be misunderstood grossly.
The writer seems to feel that the misunderstandings had caused as a result of the lack of a healthy dialogue on the part of the owners and the professional users of media. This accounts for drastic misgivings that had brought negative practices in the field of mass communication. In several short chapters the writer underlines his observations that had been misunderstood. As a communicator of truth and frankness he brings to fore some of the factors leading to professional jealousies which had caused at times bitter feelings.
I felt that the work is written in a simple readable style giving vent to more factual events than mere commentaries of a high flown nature. Though the work as a whole looks more like a series of random jottings, it nevertheless possesses a unity in diversity.
