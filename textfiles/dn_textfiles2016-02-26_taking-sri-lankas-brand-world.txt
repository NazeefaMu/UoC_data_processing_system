Taking Sri Lanka's Brand to the World

While Sri Lanka is well on its way to achieving its goal of becoming a one hundred million dollar economy, research has revealed that the best approach to fostering peace and understanding of cultures among nations is to celebrate the beauty of their people. This is the core motivation behind the staging of international beauty pageants.
Given that Sri Lanka is poised in 2016 to cross the 2 million tourist mark- the'magic number' in tourism, the island nation will be staging the Ms. Tourism Sri Lanka-International Pageant as an annual celebration of Sri Lanka, each year inviting more countries across the globe to participate, and to truly take Sri Lanka to the world.
By inviting ambassadors of beauty from all around the world, it celebrates and rewards not mere physical beauty, but grace, intelligence and acceptance of different cultures, promoting acceptance and understanding among nations.
The organizers' mission is to encourage friendship between countries and the exchange of ideas in a dynamic inclusive environment. They hope through their mission of bringing nations together, to strengthen relationships between nations and to showcase their beautiful island to the world in a new light as the pearl of the Indian Ocean.
"We are very grateful to the Sri Lanka Tourism Promotions Bureau, the travel & hospitality industry, beauty industry and state-owned organizations for the enthusiasm, encouragement and support extended to this endeavor", Ms. Tourism Sri Lanka - International founder Rosita Wickremesinghe.
"We will work with determination and purpose to take this brand forward and ensure the success of this event, and we intend to expand over the years, putting Sri Lanka on the map on a global scale" she added.
