	The seized illegally imported cigarette container was opened at the Orugodawatta container yard and had arrived from Jabel Ali Port of Dubai on December 9.
	“On the examination the Customs officials found 20,000 cigarette cartons containing 4.4 million sticks of ‘Top Mountain’ brand cigarettes,” Mr. Gamini said.
	This consignment was declared as washing powder to a non-existing name of a registered BOI company at Giriulla.
