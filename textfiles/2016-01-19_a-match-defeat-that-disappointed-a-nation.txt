This was a match the entire nation was watching with bated breath –the match between the Kiwis and the Lions. Fans had reason to cherish much hope. 
After all, wasn’t it our team that still topped the world ranking in this form of the game?
However, some players whom the nation pinned their hopes on, failed. Some others did their best. Everyone was eager to know the reason for this debacle.
There were several rumors that reached the ears of the fans here. One rumour said that one or two players were seen liberal with the bottle until the wee hours of the previous night at a party held at the residence of a compatriot in the land of Kiwis. By the way, one of these willow wielders, had, in fact, faced a serious allegation during a match series held in Galle some years ago, they say. 
Now highly disappointed lovers of the game are eagerly waiting to hear as to what action the controlling body of the game is going to take against the players who had willy-nilly let down their country. After all, the country not only lost the game, but also dropped from Number one ranking to Number three overnight.
