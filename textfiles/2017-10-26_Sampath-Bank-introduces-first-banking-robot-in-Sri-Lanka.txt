Sampath Bank is poised to revolutionize the financial industry with a banking robot that works in the form of a humanoid teller.


A never before in Sri Lanka phenomenon, the robot uses artificial intelligence to understand customers’ requests and performs transactions. It detects the presence of a customer and automatically initiates a conversation.


Currently the humanoid teller can speak and understand English and can perform seven functions; cash withdrawals, account balances, exchange rates, interest rates, details of loans & credit cards and information on how to open an account.


With customer service and convenience foremost amongst the priorities of Sampath Bank, the robot is a part of their active digitalization initiatives.


The humanoid teller will be programmed to perform more functions upon studying the customer requirements further. The bank is also planning to include Sinhala and Tamil language capabilities in the coming months.


Currently Robot Banking is available at the Sampath Bank, head quarters branch at Sir James Peiris Mawatha, Colombo 02.

To this end Sampath Bank has taken great strides forward with the introduction of the first banking robot, a landmark in banking industry.”


Basking in the glory of this powerful new innovation, the bank takes time to look back on the many firsts that have placed them in the leadership position they are in today.
