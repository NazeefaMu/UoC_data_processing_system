The Parents' Union of Medical Students (PUMS) today threatened that it would resort to fast unto death protest if a solution for the SAITM issue was further delayed.

In a joint press briefing held with the Malabe Medical College Parents Forum, it said the forthcoming month would be critical to the Government with the PUMS’ strong actions to be launched forcing the Government towards a legitimate solution.

PUMS Media Spokesman Dr. Nimal Karunasiri said that over 250 parents would join in the fast unto death protest and probably the Government would have to carry the burden if it cost lives.

He said that over two months had passed after the deans of the Medical Faculties proposed a resolution on SAITM issue, however the Government was delaying the enforcement of the proposal.

Dr. Karunasiri said that the President and the Prime Minister could not wash their hands just giving the responsibility to the Subject Minister therefore urged the Government the matter should be resolved without occupying more time. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
