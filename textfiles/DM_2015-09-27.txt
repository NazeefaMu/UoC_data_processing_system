A deadly mistake
	
A woman, her daughter and three grandchildren were admitted to the Homagama Base Hospital with symptoms of poisoning after consuming a mixture of leaves 'melluma' with their lunch, Kahathuduwa Police said.
Preliminary investigations had revealed that the grandmother had mistakenly plucked the leaves of the 'Atthana plant' all the while believing she was plucking manioc leaves.
The victims are residents of Mattegoda.
Hospital Medical Superintendent Dr. Thissa Indrasiri Perera said the health condition of the 70-year-old grandmother, her 40-year-old daughter, two granddaughters between the ages of four and eight and the three-year-old grandson was not serious.

Artillery gun found; hotel work put on hold
	
The work on a hotel project at Galle face has been put on hold following the discovery of a ancient artillery gun at the construction site on Saturday, Archaeology Department Director General Senarath Dissanayake said today.
He said the work was suspended in keeping with the law on the Prevention of Destruction and Theft of Antiques.
Dr. Dissanayake said his Department would dispatch its analysts and experts and a team of excavators to the site today.
We will reveal the details to determine the era to which the gun may belong, he said.
Meanwhile, the hotel project workers said they believed there might be more such artifacts on the site.
A worker at the site said the two rectangular pieces projecting out of the sides of the gun suggested that the 25 feet long gun must have been fixed to a stand or a carriage, which might have been buried underground over the years.
The gun was recovered on Saturday morning. A similar discovery was made at the Central Bank Premises some years ago.
Several historical records state that during the Dutch era several artillery guns were placed in and around the Galle Face area. (Yohan Perera and Dharashana Sanjeewa)

PM upbeat on Sri Lankan solution
	
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said yesterday that the resolution co-sponsored by the US and Sri Lanka placed before the UNHRC would pave the way to bring about a Sri Lankan solution to the question of reconciliation and accountability during the last stages of the war.
At a meeting with Newspaper Editors and media organization heads at Temple Trees, he said in line with the resolution a Special Counsels office would be established and a Sri Lankan would be appointed to it. The Special Counsels office would inquire into the cases concerning allegations of human rights violations.
The Prime Minister said apart from the Special Counsels Office the other most important measure would be to establish a Truth Commission and a Compassionate Council. This he said would be done with input from South Africa through the good offices of its President Jacob Zuma. A measure that the previous regime too initiated but did not carry forward. The Compassionate Council will comprise nominees by the Most Venerable Mahanayake Theras and other religious heads in the country.
The Prime Minister said cases would be probed by the Special Counsels Office and would be referred to the Truth Commission and the Compassionate Council where necessary and on exceptional cases to the courts to be prosecuted.
He said on such occasions the cases would be heard under a Sri Lankan judicial mechanism through a court that would be established for this purpose. "If the services of Commonwealth or other judges are sought and if foreign lawyers are to appear it has to be decided by Sri Lanka's Supreme Court," the Prime Minister said and added that new laws for the establishment of a Special Counsels Office and the necessary Judicial mechanism would be introduced through Parliament.
He said with the new resolution before the UNHRC, the entire international community would stand behind Sri Lanka and back its efforts at reconciliation. The Prime Minister said most of the contents of the resolution were those proposed by Sri Lanka.
He found fault with the previous Mahinda Rajapaksa government of giving pledges to the UNHRC soon after the war ended and thereafter not following up on the very pledges given by it and thus place the country in a grave situation.
The Prime Minister said the resolution also spoke of democracy and good governance and it was an occasion to restore faith in Sri Lanka's democratic system.
When asked whether the resolution had mentioned anything about withdrawing troops out of the North and East, the Prime Minister said there was nothing like that.
He said there were discussions when drafting the resolution and there were various suggestions and added that some EU countries were of the view that Human Rights came before the sovereignty of a county, whereas India and the US maintained that Human Rights comes after Sovereignty. The Prime Minister said China and Russia had maintained that sovereignty was first and as such there should not be any foreign intervention. He said these views had been discussed and the resolution had been finalised after such discussions.
The Prime Minister said the atrocities committed by the LTTE were also highlighted and particularly about the Tamil political leadership, which was wiped out by the LTTE. He said the biggest damage done by the LTTE was to the Tamil community.
Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne and Deputy Foreign Minister Harsha De Silva also attended the meeting.

Several areas of concern in resolution- MR
	
Stating that the sponsors of the draft resolution on Sri Lanka had failed to heed the request of the Sri Lankan Ambassador in Geneva not to place primary emphasis on the alleged war crimes issue and to change their approach, former president Mahinda Rajapaksa said yesterday that there were several areas of concern in the resolution
Mr. Rajapaksa in a statement said, the first operational paragraph encourages the Government of Sri Lanka to implement the recommendations of the recently released OHCHR report on Sri Lanka. The most contentious recommendations in that report have been included as operational paragraphs in the UNHRC draft resolution as the following indicates:
"Operational Paragraph 4 welcomes the willingness of the government of Sri Lanka to allow the mechanisms set up to deal with the past, to obtain financial and material assistance from international partners. This would amount to personnel in important judicial and non-judicial bodies in Sri Lanka being paid by foreign powers.
"Paragraph 6 takes note with appreciation the governments proposal to set up a judicial mechanism to investigate violations of human rights and humanitarian law, and affirms the importance of the participation of foreign prosecutors, judges, investigators and lawyers in this process, and is contrary to the claim now being made by the government that any mechanism set up will be purely domestic."
Drawing the attention to Paragraph 8, he said it encouraged the government to remove from office military officers suspected of having violated human rights through a vetting process (even if there is no evidence to prosecute them). This in reality amounts to a purge of the armed forces, he said.

SL will strive to achieve SD goals-President
	
		 		 
		 
			
President Maithripala Sirisena said Sri Lanka will act with determination as a pioneer of eco-sensitive civilization that is emerging in the 21st century to achieve the Post-2015 Sustainable Development Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) and targets that have been adopted by the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA).
Addressing the UNGA Session on Sustainable Development in New York today (September 27), he said sustainable development encapsulates the equilibrium between social and economic development and environmental protection.
President Sirisena assured the world leaders that the Government of Sri Lanka anticipates achieving these goals fully by 2030.
Sustainable Development cannot be achieved by a single country alone. Our strategy will therefore envisage a framework for cooperation between the United Nations, regional organizations and other states.
In that respect, we will work towards the provision of basic needs of the people, progressive alleviation of poverty, elimination of all forms of discrimination and inequalities, and establish a society based on social justice and human security, the President pledged.
Full speech
Mr. Chairman,
Since its inception, the United Nations Organization has always striven to make human life more rational, more meaningful and more prosperous. As world leaders, it is our responsibility and duty to build such a world.
The Government of Sri Lanka fully supports the Post-2015 Sustainable Development Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals and targets that have been adopted by this Assembly.
Accordingly, I declare that the Government of Sri Lanka will act with determination as a pioneer of eco-sensitive civilization that is emerging in the 21st century.
Sustainable development encapsulates the equilibrium between social and economic development and environmental protection. The Government of Sri Lanka anticipates achieving these goals fully by 2030.
In that respect, we will work towards the provision of basic needs of the people, progressive alleviation of poverty, elimination of all forms of discrimination and inequalities, and establish a society based on social justice and human security.
Parallel to this, while emphasizing on the protection of natural resources, we will also formulate a state policy on resource consumption based on the sustainable capacity of the environment.
We will strive to ensure that the relevant policy framework would be implemented within an institutional structure based on the principles of good governance espoused by my Government. Special attention will also be given to the concept of environmental good governance, as an integrated part of the good governance policies.
We will ensure the participation in these efforts, not only of the State sector, but the civil society and the business sector, as well.
Sustainable Development cannot be achieved by a single country alone. Our strategy will therefore envisage a framework for cooperation between the United Nations, regional organizations and other states.
Mr. Chairman,
Sri Lanka will be fully committed to dealing with the thirteenth Sustainable Development Goal relating to Climatic Change. We will strive to minimize risks of possible environmental hazards. I firmly believe that a proper study is required to ascertain how climate change aggravates Sri Lankas contemporary development challenges such as poverty alleviation, food security, increasing aging population and natural disasters.
Mr. Chairman,
In conclusion, I wish to affirm that in the preparation of development policies for Sri Lanka as an aspiring upper middle income country, our special attention is focused on poverty alleviation (SDG 01), achieving food security (SDG 02), energy (SDG 7), education (SDG 04), minimizing income disparity (SDG 10) and urban development (SDG 11).
Sri Lankas rich history, dating back beyond 2,500 years provides us with inspiration and strength in this endeavor. I like to conclude with an ancient Pali blessing that also adorns the preamble to the Constitution of Sri Lanka:
Devo vassatu kalena
Sassa-sampatti hetu cha
Phito bhavatu loko cha
Raja bhavatu dhammiko
May the rains fall in due season (Environmental balance)
May the harvest be bountiful (Economic Prosperity)
May the world prosper
May the Ruler be righteous(Good Governance)
This indicates that even many centuries ago, our ancestors possessed the wisdom and awareness of the Sustainable Development Triangle. As inheritors of this traditional knowledge and influenced by their ancient wisdom which will be adapted to meet the requirements of the modern era, Sri Lanka stands prepared to meet challenges successfully and march forward gloriously in the 21st century.
May the Noble Triple Gem bless you.
Thank you.

Wigneswaran lashes out at concentration of power in his party
	
Sri Lanka Northern Province Chief Minister C.V.Wigneswaran on Sunday publicly lashed out at concentration of power in the Ilankai Tamil Arasu Katchi (ITAK), the party to which he belongs.
ITAK is the single largest constituent of the Tamil National Alliance (TNA).
Striking a belligerent note in his address at the 125th anniversary function of Jaffna Hindu College, Wigneswaran vowed to stick to his convictions and urged the younger generation to do likewise. 
In certain political parties one or two persons are taking all decisions. These power centers expect others to accept the decisions they take. If others point out deficiencies in these decisions, they are branded as opposition parties, he said. 
Though Wigneswaran did not mention the ITAK, it was clear that the cap fitted it. He has been having a cold war with the ITAK leadership troika comprising R.Sampanthan, M.A.Sumanthiran and Mavai Senathirajah. While the troika views the Supreme Court judge-turned Chief Minister as their protg who should take orders from them, Wigneswaran feels that he got elected on the strength of his own credentials as a Tamil nationalist. On Sunday, he said that he was a Tamil nationalist at heart even while being a judge. 
While the troika has been veering towards cooperation with the new and liberal Maithripala Sirisena-Ranil Wickremesinghe government at the Center, Wigneswaran feels that the Tamils have not got much from the change of regime. He feels that the TNA should keep up its uncompromising line on the Tamil question.
In the run up to the August 17 parliamentary elections, Wigneswaran unilaterally issued a statement saying that he would be neutral and appealed to the Tamils to vote for genuine and un-buyable Tamil nationalists. The ITAK leadership took this as an endorsement of the radical Tamil National Peoples Front (TNPF). They charged that ITAK/TNA lost two seats because of Wigneswarans statement.
When the matter was raised at the last ITAK Executive Committee meeting, it was decided to have talks at the highest level. But clearly, the talks, if held, were fruitless. Wigneswaran continues to be belligerent and an irritant to the ITAK leadership. (New Indian Express)
