PHI, MOH offices offer vaccines against Japanese Encephalitis

The National Immunisation Programme of the Epidemiology Unit functions under the purview of the Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Ministry announces the availability of vaccines against Japanese Encephalitis at the offices of PHIs and MOH. Adults and children can obtain the vaccine free of charge. Children who are older than one year and adults are provided the vaccine free of charge.
Japanese Encephalitis became an epidemic in Sri Lanka in 1986. It has now been eliminated from Sri Lank. The symptoms of the disease are fever, headache and malaise. Other non specific symptoms of the disease may last for a few days.
Signs which develop during the acute encephalitic stage include neck rigidity, cachexia, hemiparesis, convulsions and a raised body temperature between 38-41 øC (100.4-105.8 øF).
