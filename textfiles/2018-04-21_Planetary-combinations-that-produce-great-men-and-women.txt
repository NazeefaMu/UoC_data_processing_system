In Predictive Astrology, yogas play an important role. There are auspicious (Subha) as well as evil (Arishta) Yogas.  The Yogas are specific planetary combinations in a horoscope of an individual that produce specific good or bad or positive or negative results. These yogas have been propounded by great ancient Indian sages like Parasara, Varahamihira and Jaimini basing them on key principles in Vedic Astrology. 

Auspicious and inauspicious yogas


There are thousands of yogas now being followed for predictive purposes. For example, there is a yoga called Daridra Yoga which says that a person afflicted by this yoga would become poor - suffer for want, even if he were born into a royal family. There is another yoga called Vasumati Yoga. A person fortified with this yoga at birth would come into immense wealth even if he were born into a poor family.  

Combinations discovered by empirical knowledge


Meanwhile, the eminent astrologers have identified through long years of empirical knowledge and evidence certain specific planetary combinations other than those yogas already propounded by great sages which produce great men and women like rulers, statesmen, great scholars, multi-billionaires, political leaders, army commanders and so on.  These specific combinations though they do not come under the yoga nomenclature provide the clue to form a snapshot judgment of the future of a native with a cursory glance at his horoscope.
