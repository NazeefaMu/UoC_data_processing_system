Angelo jokes about Sangas comeback
	
Sri Lankan Captain Angelo Mathews said that he wished his former captain Kumar Sangakkara was in the team, and had even asked him if he could come out of retirement and join them.
When asked if he would ask Kumar Sangakkara to come back from retirement, he smiled and replied in jest: "I always asked him that!"
"Even a couple days ago, I was asking him can you come and play for us, you know, in this game. He has been in tremendous form (for Surrey in County). He has been in form ever since he started playing, to be honest."
"Yes, he (Sangakkara) has had a dream career, and it's unfortunate that we don't have him anymore, but he is always willing to help us. He is always having chats with us on how we should play on these conditions, especially, it is his home ground. And he has had a lot of chats to all the younger players, including myself," added Mathews.

Army could be brought in: President
	
President Maithripala Sirisena warned that he will hand over the task of arresting the trend of religious and communal violence to the army if the police are unable to apprehend those who perpetrate these crimes.
The President said this when he met Government Ministers and MPs at the Parliamentary complex last afternoon.
These violent acts are being carried out by a group that is backed by the opposition. Why dont you tell the people who is behind these incidents, he had challenged the MPs present.
Presidents had said this in reply to a complaint made to him by UNP MP Mujubur Rahaman that the government had failed to arrest those who promote religious and communal hatred. ( Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)

REUTERS, 07th JUNE, 2017 
Attackers raided Irans parliament and opened fire at the Mausoleum of Ayatollah Khomeini a few kilometeres south of the capital on Wednesday morning, in near simultaneous assaults that killed up to seven people, media reported. 
Tasmin news agency said there were unconfirmed reports that the attackers had taken four hostages inside the parliament building. 
Three assailants, one with a pistol and two with AK-47 assault rifles, carried out the attack in central Tehran, lawmaker Elias Hazrati told state television. 
Another lawmaker said one of the assailants was surrounded by security forces and all the doors to the building had been closed, ISNA news agency reported. The attackers killed seven people and wounded several others, Tasmin said. 
I was inside the parliament when shooting happened. Everyone was shocked and scared. I saw two men shooting randomly, said one journalist at the scene, who asked not to be named. 
Around half an hour later, an attacker opened fire at the Mausoleum of Ayatollah Khomeini, injuring several members of the public, Irans English-language Press TV said. 
State news agency IRNA quoted an official at the mausoleum as saying the attacker had set off a suicide bomb after shooting at people. 
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini launched the Islamic revolution in 1979. 
Iranian TV said parliament had resumed, and broadcast footage of what it said was the opening session proceeding normally.

## Title: BOC bid for primary dealer PTL for 1st time

BOC bid for primary dealer PTL for 1st time
	
It was revealed yesterday at the inquiry at the Bond Commission that the Bank of Ceylon (BoC) had bid on behalf of a primary dealer Perpetual Treasuries Ltd (PTL), for the first time at the thirty-year bond auction conducted by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) which took place on February 27, 2015.
The CBSL had originally intended to sell 1 billion rupees (USD 7 million) worth of 30-year bonds at the primary auction held that day. Thereby, primary dealers, like BoC, could bid in the auction directly or on behalf of their clients.
The BOC had not bid directly at the auction for thirty years fearing possible economic fluctuations that might take place if it did, but did so on behalf of three companies, Kalutara Bodhi Trust, Ceylinco Insurance and Perpetual Treasuries Ltd., the latter being significant in this process since it was also a primary dealer that could directly place bids at the thirty year auction if needed.
However, it was the BoC that was chosen by the PTL as it had provided the best economic benefit to the company.
Giving evidence to the Bond Commission, former Chief Dealer of the Bank of Ceylon Treasury Division, J.K. Dharmapala, it was explained that when the auction was being held on February 27, 2015, its Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Mr. Kasun Palisena had contacted him and requested the BoC to bid on behalf of them at the bond auction and subsequently the bidding rates of PTL were sent to the BoC.
Senior State Counsel Dr. Awanthi Perera, who led the evidence, played several few recordings of phone conversations that took place between Mr. Dharmapala and Palisena for the benefit of the Commission upon which the witness was questioned.
Mr. Dharmapala revealed that the bids were placed at an interest rate of 12.50% and the bid amount bid was Rs.13 billion. He said this interest would not have been seen as acceptable by the CBSL since the acceptable interest rate for bids should be below 10% and as a result he had thought they were dummy bids.
However, he said he had to place bids on behalf of PTL without obtaining the approval from the higher authorities of the BoC and it was also revealed that due to the irregularities that had occurred during the course of the bidding process the bank's disciplinary committee had conducted an internal inquiry against Mr. Dharmapala and cautioned him.
However, after the auction results, Mr. Dharmapala said that he was shocked because he was informed that the former governor had taken the unusual step of visiting the Public Debt Department on two occasions while the auction was taking place and had instructed the authorities to accept all bids even at the rate of 12.50%.
Out of the 13 billion bids which the BoC had placed on behalf of PTL at the rate of 12.50, three billion were accepted by the CBSL.
After the acceptance of the bids at a rate of 12.50% I was wondering if PTL had inside information that indicated that the CBSL would accept these bids as generally the CBSL would not accept bids at such a high rate nor accept so many bids of this nature, he said.
Dharmapala also informed the commission that there was an officer attached to the Information Technology Department of CBSL, Mr. Sulochana, who had come to the BoC on February 26, a day prior to the thirty-year bond auction, in expectation of bidding in the auction at a rate of 12.50 %.
It was quite a coincidence, since that officer had told the back office official of the bank when forwarding his application that bids would be accepted at 12.50% the next day, he said
The witness said that Perpetual Treasuries had paid the amount due to the BoC on March 2 and the BoC had gained a bidding transaction commission of Rs. 234,000 as a profit for bidding on behalf of them.
It was also revealed at the commission that the BoC board had later issued a memorandum setting limits when bidding on behalf of customers, specifically making it compulsory to get permission from the top management of the bank when bidding on behalf of primary dealers.
The Commission, comprising Supreme Court Judges Kankanithanthri T. Chitrasiri, Prasanna Sujeewa Jayawardena and former Deputy Auditor General Kandasamy Velupillai, will resume the inquiry today. (By Shehan Chamika Silva)

China-India border tension remains despite growing economic ties: US
	

THE HINDU, 07th JUNE< 2017
The Pentagon has said that tension continues to exist along the disputed portions of the India-China border even though the economic relationship between the two countries has increased in recent years.
According to the Pentagon, Chinas use of force in territorial disputes has varied widely throughout its history.
Tensions persist along disputed portions of the Sino-Indian border, where both countries patrol with the armed forces, the Pentagon said in its annual report to Congress.
In September 2016, an Indian patrol observed that more than 40 Chinese troops had set up a temporary shelter within Indian territory in Arunachal Pradesh, which China also claims as South Tibet, it said.
The two sides conducted flag-officer level meetings where they agreed to maintain peace, and then withdrew to mutually acceptable positions, the Pentagon said as it listed out other border disputes that China has with neighbouring countries, prominent among them being the East China Sea.
Some disputes led to war, as in border conflicts with India in 1962 and Vietnam in 1979, it said, adding that a contested border with the former Soviet Union during the 1960s raised the possibility of nuclear war.
In more recent cases involving land border disputes, China has sometimes been willing to compromise with and even offer concessions to its neighbours.
Since 1998, China has settled 11 land-based territorial disputes with six of its neighbours, the Pentagon said.

Corbyns rise, terror attacks rattle PM Theresa Mays Brexit election
	

HINDUSTAN TIMES, 07th JUNE, 2017 
It is easy to forget amid the terror attacks in Manchester and London that Thursdays mid-term election was supposed to be a Brexit election  Prime Minister Theresa May has been struggling to retain the focus, but it has gone way beyond  and it shows in her ennui. 
Harold Wilson famously remarked that a week is a long time in politics, but it has been seven weeks since May stood in front of 10, Downing Street, and shocked many by announcing the election intended to steamroll opposition to her version of Brexit with a clear mandate. 
In mid-April, a massive win for the Conservatives and May was assumed. Few believed Labour and its leader, Jeremy Corbyn, would pose any challenge to Mays juggernaut  the only point of interest was how big a majority it would be. 
Three things have since then have changed perceptions: terror attacks in Manchester and London, and the remarkable rise of Corbyn, who was supposed to be a disaster and unfit for politics in the age of television. 
Opinion polls, such as they are, have swung. The gap between the two has been narrowing by the hour to the point that even Corbyns critics in his party now concede that there is a reasonable chance of emerging as the single largest party, if not an outright win.

Former Sri Lankan spin wizard, Muttiah Muralitharan, was inducted into the ICC Hall of Fame on Thursday. He was formally inducted into the Hall of Fame by David Richardson, who is the ICC Chief Executive. The special occasion took place during the innings break of the India versus Sri Lanka match.
Speaking on the occasion, Muralitharan said, It is a moment of great pride and honour to be receiving this award, especially from the ICC which is the ultimate any cricketer can aspire to achieve. The induction during this prestigious ICC Champions Trophy makes it even more remarkable.
I thank the ICC for making this possible because this is a moment I will cherish throughout life.
ICC Chief Executive David Richardson, said, Muralis record speaks for itself. His control of line, pace and length coupled with his ability to spin the ball prodigiously are legendary. Once he developed the doosra he became almost unplayable.
A character popular with fellow players and fans alike, he not only helped raise the profile of Sri Lankan cricket but was a player people came out to watch the world over. I congratulate him on behalf of the ICC on being inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame.
It may be recalled here that Muralitharan is the most successful Test bowler with 800 wickets in 133 matches. He has taken 67 five-wicket innings hauls and 22 10-wicket match hauls in Tests. He is also the most successful in ODI cricket with 534 wickets in 350 matches.

Minister of Sports Dayasiri Jaysekera is to seek Cabinet approval for a pension scheme for all sportsmen and sportswomen who had brought fame to Sri Lanka.
The Minister came out with this plan of his in response to a question raised by the MPs in Parliament on the issue with regard to Olympic Medal winner Susanthika Jayasinghe who is in the centre of a controversy currently over a plan to auction her silver medal.
We have to think of other Sri Lankan sportsmen and sportswomen who had kept the countrys flag flying in the past as well other than Ms. Jayasinghe. Therefore, I have decided to submit a paper to the Cabinet seeking its approval for a pension scheme for all sportsmen and sportswomen who have brought fame to the country, the Minister said yesterday.
There are other athletes such as Sriyani Kulawansa, Damayanthi Darsha and Sugath Tilakaratne who have won medals even at the Commonwealth Games. We cannot cater to Susanthika alone when there are others who have done their job for the country, he added.
The Minister said the Ministry of Sports paid a sum of Rs 60,000 to Ms. Jayasinghe while the Army also paid an equal amount. However, he said the payment was suspended as she failed to provide an activity report as an adviser to the Ministry.
The auditors questioned the Ministry over the payments made to her without a report to back the services she provided, the Minister added. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwarana)

Philippines troops thwarted an original plan drawn up by the Islamist militants now holed up in Marawi City to spread terror in a rampage of violence that would have given them full control of the southern town, the military said on Wednesday.
There was indeed a bigger plan and it was supposed to wreak more havoc, military spokesman Restituto Padilla told a news conference as aerial bombing resumed against fighters who have sworn allegiance to the ultra-radical Islamic State.
Philippine senators said members of the upper house were last week shown a video of the militants, led by a group known as Maute, plotting a far more sophisticated siege of Marawi City than the attack they launched there on May 23.`

The joint opposition said yesterday the Central Bank should make it compulsory for banks to accept Qatar Riyals for conversion into SL rupees, in the wake of several Middle Eastern countries servering diplomatic relations with Qatar.
JO member Prof. Tissa Vitharana told a news briefing that more than 150,000 Sri Lankans were employed in Qatar and that they were paid in Qatar Riyals.
Either they can exchange Qatar Riyals to Sri Lankan Rupees in Sri Lanka or else they have to exchange them to US Dollars in Qatar. These migrant workers will face a huge issue if the banks in Sri Lanka refuse to exchange Qatar Riyals in future, he said.
Prof. Vitharana said those workers could be considered as a main source of foreign exchange to the country and as such, the government should immediately intervene in resolving this matter. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

He said Sri Lanka has been a key point in international shipping routes that have been criss-crossing from east to west for several hundreds of years and joining OBOR was a natural consequence of this.
Chinas OBOR project aims to put billions of dollars in infrastructure projects including railways, ports and power grids across Asia, Africa and Europe.

SL beat India by 7 wickets in Champions Trophy clash
	
Sri Lanka staged a superb run chase to stun India and keep alive their Champions Trophy challenge as Kusal Mendis inspired a famous seven-wicket victory over the holders on Thursday.
Needing 322 to avoid a second successive Group B defeat, Sri Lanka powered to a memorable triumph at The Oval thanks to key contributions from Mendis (89), Danushka Gunathilaka (76) and captain Angelo Mathews (52).
Mathews admitted earlier this week that many experts expected his underdogs to be thrashed by in-form India.
But Sri Lanka defied the odds to win with eight balls to spare and they can qualify for the semi-finals if they beat Pakistan in their final group match in Cardiff on June 12.
After losing by 99 runs against South Africa in their opener, that would be a remarkable turnaround for a young Sri Lanka team in the midst of a major rebuilding project.
India's failure to secure a second consecutive win after thumping arch rivals Pakistan was a major surprise and they must beat South Africa at The Oval on Sunday to avoid a humiliating exit.
Shikhar Dhawan's 125 had put India in a strong position as the holders piled up 321 for six. The 31-year-old hit 15 fours and one six in his 128-ball innings, receiving strong support from Rohit Sharma (78) and MS Dhoni (63), but it wasn't enough.
India had only themselves to blame after squandering the momentum given to them by Bhuvneshwar Kumar, who dismissed Niroshan Dickwella for seven when the opener's edge was caught by Ravindra Jadeja.
Needing what would be a record run chase in ODIs staged at The Oval, Gunathilaka set about giving Sri Lanka hope.
He hit Umesh Yadav for a sky-scraping six and, together with the aggressive Mendis, imposed himself well enough to build a quick-fire 50 partnership.
Hardik Pandya had a chance to remove Mendis with the score on 70-1, but the young all-rounder dropped a chance off his own bowling. (Times of India)

UK voters take to polls in general election
	
British voters will take to the polls Thursday for the third major vote in three years in a snap election called by Conservative Prime Minister Theresa May.
The general election comes less than one year after the Brexit vote that saw the UK vote to leave the European Union by 52 per cent to 48 per cent.
That result saw Conservative PM David Cameron resign and be replaced by Mrs May.
She called the snap election in April when polls showed her with a more than 20 point lead over Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn in a bid to increase the Conservative majority and strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with 27 EU member states.
However missteps during the campaign and a focus on domestic policy have seen Mr Corbyn narrow the gap to within seven points, according to latest polls.
The 68-year-old anti-war campaigner has spent more than 30 years in parliament and inspired hundreds of thousands into politics with his left-wing policies.
Voter turnout is expected to be a large factor in the result, with record numbers of people signing up to vote. More than 600,000 names were added to the electoral role in the final 24 hours, beating the previous spike of 525,000 before the Brexit referendum.
The vote comes after a deadly terror attack at London Bridge that killed eight people and injured 48, leading to a last-minute focus on security and policing.
Mrs May has been forced to defend her previous role as Home Secretary that saw cuts to police budgets. The day before votes closed she said she had no regrets about calling the election to take place three years early.
Ive enjoyed the campaign, she said. There is a very clear choice for people when they come to vote.
Asked about the result, the 60-year-old who has made much of the fact shes a vicars daughter said: I never predict election results.
Mr Corbyn, who has proposed the most socialist Labour Party manifesto in decades said: Wouldnt it be great if on Friday we woke up to ... a Labour government that will be a government for all of our communities across the whole of the country.
Other major parties the Liberal Democrats, Greens and UK Independence Party have struggled to gain traction during the campaign. (news.com.au)

The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) said today it would inform President Maithripala Sirisena about Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne's unethical behaviour when handling various matters.
GMOA Secretary Naveen De Soyza said the minister had violated the World Health Organization (WHO) rules and the regulations.
Instead of supporting the victims of floods and landslides, the Health Ministry has appointed the head of one of the dairy product companies to head the Health Ministry's Disaster Management Centre, he said and added that the GMOA had set up some 500 health camps countrywide to treat those affected but the minister had been unable to set up even a single health camp.
Dr. De Soyza said GMOA had not been invited by the Health Ministry to yesterday's internship ceremony for the newly-passed out doctors.
Traditionally trade unions attached to the medical sector were invited to this function but the GMOA was not invited despite being the main trade union which represents the government medical officers, he said adding that this might have been over a grudge with the GMOA.(Kalathma Jayawardhane)
