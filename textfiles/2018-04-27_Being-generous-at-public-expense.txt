A story doing rounds in public administration circles says that a white-collar high-up functioning directly under a high political authority connected to trade is reportedly giving some of his favorites acting appointments in addition to their substantive positions as a ploy to give them unjust perks.

 


For examples, three assistant directors of a certain establishment have been appointed as acting directors as a ruse to extend to them certain perks like official vehicles. 


The white-collar high-up is making irregular appointments to offer various perks to his favorites using the clout he wields thanks to his close connection to a high political authority, they say.
