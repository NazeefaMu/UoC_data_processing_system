Withdraw new tax policy on alcohol: GMOA


	

The Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) yesterday urged the government to withdraw the 2018 budget proposal on new tax policy and issue of licence on alcohol with immediate effect.

Addressing a press conference, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said that the procedure to introduce a new tax system and issue of licence on alcohol would create more tendencies among liquor users to consume more alcohol; consequently it would increase the liquor consumption which is now 20% of the total population.

“The new proposal on alcohol would provide 40% of tax concessions in importing liquor from abroad and would provide easy access for anyone to put up a liquor shop. We as a responsible union have predetermined the gravity of this issue before the budget was presented to parliament following information received from confidential sources,” Dr. Aluthge stated.

He proceeded to say that the new proposal on alcohol had violated article 6.2 and 6.3 underlined in the National Policy on Alcohol Control which was introduced in 2016 by the incumbent regime. (Sheain Fernandopulle)
