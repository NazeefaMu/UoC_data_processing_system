Criticizing the government’s move to increase the salaries of MPs, the Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) today said their salaries should be based on their performance similar to any other organisation.

PHU Leader and MP Udaya Gammanpila said the government should evaluate the progress it had made so far before increasing the salaries of the MPs.

“In any institution, the salaries of employees are usually based on their performance. The employees who work hard should receive salary increments and those who are slacking off should get their bonus reduced. The government should follow this method and do a self-evaluation,” he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
