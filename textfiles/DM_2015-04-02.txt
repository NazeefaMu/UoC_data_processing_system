Bribery Comm. DG denies receiving two salaries
	
	Categorically denying the allegations that she received two salaries Bribery Commission Director General Dilrukshi Dias Wickramasinghe yesterday requested the Commissions Chairman to conduct a full-scale probe into her actions.
	Speaking to Daily Mirror at 9.30pm today from her office at the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption, the DG said that she was innocent and was ready to prove her innocence at any forum.
	Ms. Wickramasinghe said that the baseless and frivolous allegations were made to demoralise her and prevent her from fighting corruption.
	She had requested the Chairman of the Commission, Justice Jagath Balapatabendi, to conduct a full scale probe and stated her willingness to support it in any form.
	A group of SLFP Parliamentarians, led by MP Manusha Nanayakkara, had lodged a complaint against the incumbent DG claiming that she had received two salaries in 2002, whilst working at the Attorney Generals Department and also as a Consultant to the Telecommunications Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka.

CA suspends full face helmet ban
	
	The Court of Appeal today issued an interim order suspending the operation of police advisory circular banning the use of full face helmets until April 28.
	The Court of Appeal bench comprising Justice Vijith K. Malalgoda (President) and H.C.J. Madawala made this order sequent to two writ petitions filed by a Chartered Accountant and Rtd. Major who sought an order prohibiting the authorities from taking any steps towards imposing a ban on the use of full face helmets.
	Presidents Counsel Faizer Mustapha appearing with Pulasthi Rupasinghe, Harshana de Silva, Mehan Careem and Charaka Jayaratne appearing for Rtd. Major Nalaka Indrajith also sought an interim order to suspend the operation of the gazette notification No. 644/20 dated 11/1/1991.
	Meanwhile, Counsel Thishya Weragoda, Iresh Senevirathna and Mrs. Niluka Dissanayake appearing for the second petitioner Chanaka Dassanayake of Pita Kotte a Chartered Accountant by profession also made a similar application for an interim relief. He further affirmed that a public outcry had arisen against the new decision.
	The Petitioner stated that, as per information disseminated by the Police Media Spokesman, a total of 128 incidents of robbery had been reported in 2014 committed by persons wearing full face helmets. He further stated that as per statistics made available by the Department of Police, over 4000 robberies had been committed in 2013. He stated that on 25th March 2015, the Media Spokesman of Police, notified to the public at a press conference that the ban on the use of full face helmets will be made effective with effect from 2nd April 2015.
	The Petitioner maintained that the decision of the IGP to ban the use of full face helmets with effect from 2nd April 2015 has not been communicated to the public by way of any regulation or publication in the Government Gazette, and the Petitioner verily believes that the only communication in this regard has been the press statement made by the Media Spokesman. The Petitioner further pleads that the objective of minimising crime rates, which is the purported objective of introducing the ban on full face helmets, could be achieved through other less restrictive means, such as simply ensuring that full face helmets imported, manufactured or otherwise sold in Sri Lanka fully comply with the Motor Traffic (Approved Protective Helmets) Regulations 1990, thus ensuring that full face helmets do not by any means obscure, conceal or distort the identity of the wearers of such helmets..(Lakmal Sooriyagoda)

China rejects Rajithas claim
	
	The Chinese embassy in Colombo today denied claims by Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne that the estimated cost of the Colombo Outer Circular Road was reduced by Rs.30 billion.
	An embassy spokesperson told Daily Mirror that the news report on the Colombo Outer Circular Road cost reduction was not in line with the facts. "We have contacted the relevant Chinese contractor. It was proved that no agreement was reached between the Chinese contractor and Sri Lanka Road Development Authority on any reduction of the cost of the project. The so-called Rs. 30 billion commission being paid to the previous government was also groundless. The total contract cost by the Chinese contractor is Rs. 66.8 billion, he said.
	He said the contract cost was reasonable since the 9.5 kilometre project included a six kilometer long viaduct as well as the building of a 3.5 kilometre long embankment which he said was a low estimate compared to those quoted by other countries. (Kelum Bandara)

Insights on fixed income investing fundamentals by CAL
	
CAL Treasuries CEO Gihan Hemachandra
Capital Alliance (CAL), Sri Lankas leading full service investment bank, has long been recognized as a market leader in Sri Lankas financial and investment arena. The company has helped both blue-chip conglomerates and individuals to make significant returns on their investments and transactions.
CAL Treasuries headed by Chief Executive Officer Gihan Hemachandra shared valuable insights of fixed income investing to potential investors. Hemachandra leads a dynamic team of 10 professionals who handle the companys rapidly expanding portfolio.
How fixed income securities work: Fixed income securities are investments that provide a return in the form of fixed periodic payments and promise the return of capital invested on a predetermined maturity date. Fixed income instruments can generally be classified as those issued by the Government of Sri Lanka (generally known to be risk-free instruments and termed gilt-edged securities) and those issued by companies (commonly known as credits or corporate debt). Fixed income instruments differ from deposits because they are tradable by nature and provide investors with an early exit opportunity if it is ever required.
Why investors should make fixed income investments: Fixed income instruments provide stability, arising from fixed interest yields throughout the investment period. A variety of options within the asset class (e.g. Government treasury bonds, corporate bonds, etc.) and maturities (tenures ranging from one day to 30 years) further serve to add to the stability proposition. A more profitable method of investing in fixed income is through leveraged trading. In summary, an investor can use the fixed income instrument they have invested in as collateral to borrow against and reinvest in more of the same or similar instruments. The immediate additional return from leveraged trading arises out of carrying a tenure mismatch. Investors can determine the appropriate timing of entry and exit for the strategy, thereby netting substantial capital gains using the knowledge and expertise of CALs fixed income advisors.
CAL offers fixed income investments through a variety of instruments including the trading of Treasury bills and bonds, repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements, leverage trading on government securities, listed and unlisted debentures, commercial papers, securitizations and interest rate swaps and forwarding rate agreements.
Clients can initially make money through interest, which is accrued over time on their investments. Thereafter, capital gains can be earned from an overall fall in market yields and/or contraction in credit spreads. Maintaining maturity mismatches on fixed income portfolios also results in a high net interest income.
Factors to consider when making fixed income investments: The client can get a first-hand experience of how this asset class works by investing in its simplest form, known as repos (repurchase agreements). This initial learning can provide comfort and pave the way for the more sophisticated products offered by CAL. When investing in the more sophisticated products, the client should have a medium to long-term appetite with a broad investment outlook. He or she should be able to understand the relationship between yield and the price of fixed income products, as this is vital in making an informed decision in the course of active fixed income trading. Clients should also be able to understand the risk of interest rate volatility should the need arise to exit an investment. CALs advisors are well informed and are therefore capable of educating and advising clients, so that they can make wise and profitable investments.

Having commenced operations in October 2000, CAL has established itself as a leading player in the financial markets of Sri Lanka. The company specializes in the origination, trading and investment of debt and equity securities and this mix of expertise and services allows CAL to offer integrated and customized solutions to its customers across the entire financial spectrum.

IUSF says no Policemen injured during clash
	
The Inter University Students Federation (IUSF) today rejected the news that several Police personnel were injured in a clash between the university students and the Police during the recent protest march at Kollupitiya.
It also rejected the media release issued by the Prime Ministers office saying that it allowed IUSF representatives to take part in a discussion.
IUSF convener Najith Indika said that it was a fabricated story to divert peoples attention from the issue.
He said that the clash had created a bad impression on the government.
We completely reject the news that is spreading about a clash between the Police and university students. We can prove that no Police personnel were injured in the incident. This is a fabricated story to divert peoples attention from the real issues, he said.
Indika said they were not granted any opportunity to participate in any discussion as claimed by the Prime Ministers office.
He said the attack was launched on the students not to disperse them but it was a planned revenge attack.
He said that they would take legal action against the Police for firing tear gas on the students violating the laws.
It is illegal to fire tear gas canisters lower than 45 degrees but the Police had fired directly on the students. Several students were injured hit by the cylinders of tear gas canisters. Three of them are still undergoing treatment at the National Hospital in Colombo and the Balangoda Hospital, he said. (Ajith Siriwardana)

Buddha Sasana and Democratic Rule Deputy Minister Tissa Karaliyadda today said that he resigned from his Deputy Ministerial post because he cannot work with the United National Party (UNP) and he could not just be a pambaya, (scarecrow).
He said he was thankful to President Maithripala Sirisena for appointing him as a Deputy Minister and that it was a great opportunity working with a person like Minister Karu Jayasuriya.
However, I intend to be a minister in a cabinet headed by a Prime Minister from the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP). We cannot expect any favourable change under this government. Therefore, I have tendered my resignation to the President but there has been no response yet. he said.
He said the support of all the political parties was essential for good governance but said the UNP was not supporting the President or the government to reach the goals of Yahapalanaya thus making it a troublesome journey.
He said he could reconsider his decision if the UNP ministers proved that they are committed to the Yahapalanaya programme at least in six months time. Now we cannot see a single mission of Yahapalanaya in action, he said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

On President Sirisenas maiden visit to China
	
By Col. R. Hariharan
President Maithripala Sirisenas Chinese visit began on March 25, 2015. This visit comes after his governments willingness to strengthen ties with neighbour India with the leaders of both countries visiting each others nation within a month and the suspension of Chinese-aided Colombo Port City reclamation project.Question
How do you see this visit and do you think China would be ready for any renegotiations on its Port City projects or any debt finance
The present government says the Chinese government is clean but its companies are involved in corrupt deals under the former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. The government says it wants to eliminate corruption similar to what the Chinese leaders are doing in their country. Appreciate your comment.Answer
There are two parts to this question. The one relating to Sri Lanka-India relations will be viewed by China as a multilateral international issue, while the other relating to suspension of Chinese-aided projects will be treated by both countries as a bilateral one.
China under President Xi Jinping is promoting the revival of the Silk Route as well as the 21st Century Maritime Road in a big way as part of its strategic westward reach. It involves reaching out to the South Asian countries as well as the Indian Ocean Region (IOR). India by its size, soft power and economic clout dominates both the subcontinent and the Indian Ocean neighbourhood.
If we go by his performance so far, President Xi has emerged as a pragmatist who does not lose sight of his end goals as long as his core interests are not threatened. Chinas media comments after Prime Minister Modis three-nation visit in the IOR indicate a better appreciation in Beijing of Indias role in IOR. Perhaps President Xi having factored Modis assertive leadership style understood that wishing away India in this region would not be easy and it would not benefit China. So Beijing seems to be in a mood to cooperate and coordinate (if possible) its activities with India in this region.
This could be related to the international strategic environment as well as Chinas desire to take advantage of Indias growth story which is being rewritten under Modis leadership. Of course, China objections to Prime Minister Modis February 2015 visit to Arunachal Pradesh showed that despite all the cooing comments, Beijing would not compromise upon its core interest.
Indias experience in dealing with China holds an important lesson for Sri Lanka leadership  there will be no mixing of metaphors when it comes to Chinas national interest. We can expect President Sirisena to face the moment of truth when he talks with President Xi. So, the Sri Lankan argument about cleaning up corruption in all projects, including the Chinese ones, just as China is doing, may not cut much ice except sympathetic nods.
China will be attaching importance to the Sri Lankan leaders visit because of the not so friendly impression he and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe had created in the run up to the election. They decried Chinese-promoted mega projects as extravagant and suspected the opaque processes adopted to promote them as the source of corruption to benefit the Rajapaksa clan. They had also accused Mahinda Rajapaksa of being partial to China at the cost of Sri Lankas cordial relations with India. Chinese normally do not forget such comments easily.
Even before the visit, China had been relentlessly pursuing action through local media to clear its association with any criminal or corrupt activity. China is conscious of its emergence as a global power and reacts strongly when small countries make accusations against China.
Chinese leaders would mince no words about their unhappiness at such remarks in one-to-one talks. (Probably they would have done this when Foreign Minister Samaraweera visited China earlier (preparatory to Sirisenas visit).
Sri Lanka is perhaps the most important among the Indian Ocean islands to promote Chinas present strategic objectives. This is further increased due to the geo-strategic advantage India already enjoys in Sri Lanka. So Chinas first priority would be to consolidate its existing goodwill and protect the economic assets it had created during the Rajapaksa days. So, we can expect China to make serious efforts to show Sri Lanka the tangible economic advantages Sri Lanka in kick starting the stalled projects are resumed. Some of them like the rural water supply project are really value-added ones.
Among the projects Colombo port reclamation is most prestigious and strategically important for China, both from maritime security and commercial points of view. Already Sri Lanka appears to have tacitly agreed not to cancel the project as indicated by the Sri Lankan Prime Minister. Sri Lanka government has also agreed for the construction of breakwater that would help the project. But Chinese are tough negotiators with immense patience; so Sri Lanka would probably end up giving in more than gaining much.
However, to save faces on both sides we can expect the Chinese to provide access to books to show their hands are clean. They would make some concessions on financial terms by some deferred repayment and probably loosen some clause relating to the Chinese control of sovereign rights parts ceded to them as part of the project. We can also expect easier terms for fresh loans.
Of course, we can expect China to beef up the existing strategic security partnership pact between the two countries. Sri Lanka has strong appetite for improving its naval platforms and aircraft for surveillance and protection of its near ocean waters. To meet this need, the existing joint committee on coastal security could be activated with offer of coastal naval craft and speedy delivery of those in pipeline. We can also expect China to try and free Sri Lanka from Indian navys monopoly in training the island nations naval forces. But this is more easily said than done.
Lastly, China seems to be interested in promoting China-Sri Lanka-India trilateral cooperation as a win-win strategy for peace and prosperity of the three countries. Though Foreign Minister Wang Yi had spoken about it, it does not appear to within the realms of probability in near term. While we can expect to hear more about this after Modis visit to Beijing, President Xi might bring up the idea in his talks with President Sirisena as he would probably welcome such an initiative.(This article is an elaboration of answer given to an international news agencys question on President Sirisenas visit to China on March 25, 2015)
