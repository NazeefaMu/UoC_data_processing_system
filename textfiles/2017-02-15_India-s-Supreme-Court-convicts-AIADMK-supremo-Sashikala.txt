India’s  Supreme Court convicts AIADMK supremo Sashikala


	



 

The Supreme Court on Tuesday found AIADMK general secretary VK Sasikala guilty in a 21-year-old disproportionate assets case and asked her to surrender immediately.  


She’s been sentenced to four years in jail and also asked to pay a fine of Rs 10 crore.  


The judgment also bars Sasikala from holding a public office and contesting elections for 6 years, strengthening the hand of caretaker Chief Minister O Panneerselvam, who is locked in a bitter power struggle with her.  


The order also vindicates governor C Vidyasagar Rao’s decision to delay calling Sasikala to form the government in the southern state that has been facing political uncertainty for days.   


Rao was criticised for encouraging horse trading and doing the Centre’s bidding in denying Sasikala a fair shot at the top job.   


Sasikala was accused number two; in the Rs 66-crore disproportionate assets case.
