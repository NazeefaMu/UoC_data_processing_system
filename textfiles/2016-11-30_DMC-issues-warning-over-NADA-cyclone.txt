The Disaster Management Centre (DMC) today warned people living in coastal areas of Mullaitivu and Jaffna to be vigilant due to the cyclonic storm  NADA which is located around 400km to the east of Mullaitivu coast.

The cyclone is expected to move north-westward closer to Jaffna peninsula. “Sea areas from Mannar to Trincomalee via Kankasanthurai will be rough and dangerous. People by the sea should be more vigilant as sea waves  can be risen about three metres,” the DMC said.

Meanwhile, the Meteorology Department said the cyclone is likely to cross North Tamil Nadu coast midnight tomorrow.

“Under the influence of the deep depression in the South-west Bay of Bengal which has developed into the cyclone,  strong winds and heavy showers are expected in the Northern, Eastern and North-central provinces till December 2,” it said.
