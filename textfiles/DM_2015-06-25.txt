NITF- Lanka Hospitals tie-up boosts state healthcare services
	
In a groundbreaking development in national healthcare, The National Insurance Trust Fund (NITF) has entered into an affiliation with Lanka Hospitals, offering government employees access to high quality private healthcare services at affordable costs.
All public sector employees; eligible for pension, are automatically entitled to NITFs health insurance scheme titled Agrahara. The affiliation between the NITF and Lanka Hospitals will eventually make high expenditure private medical treatment like Heart bypass (CABG) and kidney surgery, hip and knee replacement surgeries more affordable to all public sector employees covered under this scheme.
The scheme empowers public sector employees by providing them financial protection against unforeseen health problems, Sanath C. De Silva, CEO of the NITF said. 
While the Agrahara Insurance scheme has stipulated sums for major surgeries, the cost of undergoing these surgeries in private medical institutions are often much higher. If a public sector employee has to undergo surgery in private hospital, patients have to bear a considerable additional cost, running into approximately Rs. 200,000  300,000 more than the sum assured for such surgery by Agrahara, making the surgery way beyond the means of the employee.

Since it is a pre-arranged cost for major surgeries agreed upon in the affiliation, a wider scope and options at affordable rates are available to the public sector employee for major surgery. 
The affiliation also paves the way for more transparent costs, with patients kept aware of exactly how much they will incur, thus letting them prepare their finances accordingly, explained Nilantha Ratnayake, Head of Sales and Marketing, Lanka Hospitals PLC.
Lanka Hospitals has set up a dedicated counter for Agrahara recipients, which assists patients in securing the funds before the procedure, offering convenience and peace of mind for Agrahara patients at Lanka Hospitals.
LH also offers discounts for procedures, including 10 percent inpatient and outpatient discount on laboratory investigations, and 5 percent discount on radiology for inpatient and outpatients, as well as 10 percent discount on room tariffs. In addition, Rs. 25,000 discount on all heart surgeries, including CABG, PTCA, etc., up to 3 post consultations after surgery with the hospital fee waived, and special surgery packages for general surgeries such as hernia, appendectomy, etc., ENT, Gynecology, Vascular and Ophthalmology surgeries, ensure Agrahara recipients receive the best possible financial assistance.
The Agrahara Insurance scheme currently services over 1 million public sector employees, as well as an additional one million dependents. Operating as a non-profit fund, under the Ministry of Policy Planning, Economic Affairs, Child Youth and Cultural Affairs; the size of the fund annually is Rs. 1.2 billion. De Silva points out that claims paid out almost equal the size of the fund, and stresses that claims are settled expediently with minimum red-tape, adding that NITF is consistently the largest claim payer in health insurance. 
Among the covers issued by the policy include settlements of Rs. 600,000 in the case of accidental death and Rs. 100,000 in the case of death due to natural causes and a hospital cover of Rs. 100,000 per event. For serious surgeries such as Heart by-pass (CABG) surgery, kidney transplants, hip replacements, etc. the cover offered is Rs. 400,000. The majority of contributors to the fund are from the Department of Police, Ministries of Health and Education, Department of Civil Security, etc.

Sports Minister Navin Dissanayake today asked former president Mahinda Rajapaksa to disclose whether it was the same Gang of robbers that would govern the country if he was elected prime minister again.
The minister said some MPs including himself quit the previous government as a means of expressing their protest at the incidence of fraud and corruption committed by some politicians during the previous regime.
He said it was clear that Mr. Rajapaksa was carrying out his political campaign through falsehoods and deception. The minister said that Mr. Rajapaksa had even falsely claimed that 59 army camps in the North had been removed.
We ask Mr. Rajapaksa to name even a single army camp that had been removed as claimed by him. We will not allow any such thing to happen. As a veteran politician he should not make such blatantly false statements, the minister said.
He said the former president had not made any statement regarding the allegations made against him including those of having misused state vehicles, palatial houses built in several parts of the country and the corruption involved in road construction projects.(Ajith Siriwardana)WATCH

SL instant noodles safe: Health DG
	
Samples of locally produced instant noodles tested at the Industrial Technology Institute (ITI) have been found to be safe and their lead concentration is below the internationally accepted risk level, Health Services Director General Dr. Palitha Mahipala said today.
An ad-hoc Food Consultative Committee meeting chaired by Dr. Mahipala and attended by officials representing the Consumer Affairs Authority, Sri Lanka Standard Institute and relevant Health Ministry officials was held to discuss the risk factors involving the instant Maggi noodles and also the steps taken by the Food Control Unit of the Health Ministry on the issue.
It was revealed during the discussion that Sri Lanka did not import instant noodles or related raw materials from India or any other country except Monosodium Glutamate, the main ingredient used to produce instant noodles.
The tests carried out at the ITI laboratories on randomly collected samples of instant noodles from the local market had revealed that lead contents of them were comparatively lower than the minimum permitted level. However, it was also revealed that a minimum permissible level of lead in noodles had not been determined in Sri Lanka by any institution, Dr. Mahipala stressed.
The lowest permissible level of lead in noodles in accordance with the international standards is 0.3mg/kg. The lead concentration in instant noodles samples tested at ITI was less than this level, he added.
As a precautionary measure, we decided to test all varieties of noodles imported to Sri Lanka if any before entering them to the domestic market for heavy metals like lead, mercury, arsenic and cadmium etc. All noodles producers in the country are ordered to occasionally test their noodles stocks for lead content, at a qualified laboratory with the assistance of district food inspectors and immediately remove stocks from the market if found to be containing lead concentrations over the permitted level of 0.3mg/kg., Dr. Mahipala said.
The committee also decided to suspend promotions, advertisements and commercials or any type of publicity on noodles in the print or electronic media or in any other medium until the situation returned to normal, he said. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

This enables the student to follow the lesson along with the lesson notes which are made available on a PDF format.
Speaking about the launch of the new online programme Nalin Wijekoon, Chairman Finance Houses Association (FHA), Council member of SLICM and the CEO of Softlogic Finance said, Sound knowledge in credit is compulsory for the industries focused on lending. The signature Advanced Diploma of SLICM covers all the key aspects of credit which is required by the industry.

	Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC) Leader Rauff Hakeem, in an emotional speech, said in Parliament yesterday that his party had been placed in a worse predicament after it tried to unseat former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.
	Making his remarks during the debate on electoral reforms, he said, See our plight today. We tried to unseat Mr. Mahinda Rajapaksa. But we are now in a worse predicament.
	Mr. Hakeem said that there was a dictator in the government. Then Opposition MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara asked him who had gazetted the electoral reforms.
	Mr. Hakeem replied, We did not do it. There is a kitchen Cabinet. The United National Party (UNP) has a proprietary attitude towards these electoral reforms. I am not a cats paw of the Prime Minister. A dictatorial behaviour of this nature in the evolution of electoral reforms has never been seen before.
	The Opposition asked who this dictator was. Mr. Hakeem, who is also the Urban Development Minister, said, It is not the President. It is those aspiring for the presidency. These elements even try to capture the power of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP). (Kelum Bandara and Yohan Perera)

## Title: Will it be another white elephant

Will it be another white elephant
	
By Champika Fernando
The Ministry of Sports will press ahead with the proposed multi-million dollar High Altitude Training Centre and the super luxury hotel within the confines of the picturesque Race Course in Nuwara Eliya once it gets the Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) done.
Rejected by the Cabinet Review Sub Committee (CRSC) of the Treasury on two previous instances (2009 and 2013), the project has been pursued under the new government despite all of the former regimes unsolicited projects being suspended as a policy decision.
Once completed, the High Altitude Training Centre will provide indoor and outdoor training facilities at 1868m altitude. But questions have been raised about the cost at which the government is pursuing the project in one of Sri Lankas most sought after tourist locales.
The training facility is expected to have 400 metre and 200-metre running tracks, a 400-metre natural running track, two pavilions, a cricket ground, an indoor stadium, swimming pools, training centres and five-star hotel.
According to the Central Environmental Authority (CEA), they previously rejected an EIA done by the Urban Development Authority and ordered a fresh EIA to be carried out for approval.
The Urban Development Authority had done an EIA some years back but we rejected it. So we will assess the impact on the environment once the new EIA is done, a source from the CEA confirmed.
Sports Minister Navin Dissanayake, when contacted, confirmed that he is going ahead with the proposal despite the enormous cost involved.
I have got the treasury approval after assessing the financial feasibility of the project. The next step is to get the EIA done through a reputed organization before getting the cabinet approval, minister confirmed.
Accordingly the ministry has asked University of Moratuwa to do the EIA.
I personally believe that there would not be any environment impact here since its a massive flat land. But we will go through proper channels to get this project through, he added. A Bill of Quantities provided by a China-based firm, China Volant Industry Co. Ltd, in December 2014, given to then Sports Minister, Mahindananda Aluthgamage, to design, supply materials and build the high performance training centre, has quoted a whopping US$ 88 million.
An additional US$14 million is put down as credit loan management fees, credit loan commitment fees, loan interests during grace period and loan interests after grace period. The amount to be obtained is a loan and has to be repaid to the funding source.
However, Minister Dissanayake said that the training facility will cost US$ 61 million while US$ 20 million will be spent on putting up a five-star hotel in the popular tourist destination to generate income. The funders have given a 20-year repayment period with three year grace period of pay off the loan.
But critics question the need for such a high-profile training centre for Sri Lanka at such high cost. They also ask what plans the government has in place to recover the investment.
Sri Lanka spent over Rs. 3 billion in renovation and construction of the three cricket venues in Kettarama, Pallekele and Sooriyawewa to co-host the World Cup in 2011 but have since struggled to foot the bill with millions still owed to the state-owned institutions
I was initially concerned about the cost of the project, whether it would be another white elephant, the Minister maintained. But Im confident that it wont be a white elephant. We will have the hotel and also we will get foreign athletes coming down for training here. So in this way we could generate funds.
Of course, we need a high altitude training centre in order for our athletes to achieve excellence in sports. But the question is whether we need such a high profile place and also whether the Race course is the right location for it, said Panduka Keerthinananda, former Chairman of Sugathadasa National Sports Complex Authority.
This is a very important place for us and if we put a cluster of buildings in that area, it will not only damage the beauty of the environment but pose many environmental hazards. The best is to shift it to a different place, he added
According to documents in the Daily Mirrors possession, Rs. 200 million had been spent in 2009 when Gamini Lokuge was the Minister of Sports to develop the infrastructure in the 85-acre land but was later abandoned due to environmental concerns.

Banks refusing to pay guaranteed 15% interest: JVP
	
	Banks had refused to pay the guaranteed 15 per cent interest rate for the deposits of senior citizens with over a million rupees in their accounts despite the assurance given by the government in the budget this year, Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) MP Sunil Handunnetti said yesterday.
	Mr. Handunnetti, who raised an oral question on the matter in Parliament, said the banks had gone even further and asked senior citizens with more than one million in their accounts to withdraw their monies.
	Chief Government Whip, Gayantha Karunatilleke, who responded, explained that senior citizens who had more than one million rupees in their accounts would be entitled to the 15 per cent interest rate only for the one million rupees while they would earn the usual interest rates for sums in excess of that remaining in their accounts.
	He said the treasury would reimburse the extra funds which the banks had to bear to pay the elevated rate of interest to the senior citizen. The Chief Government Whip said a sum of Rs 182. 4 million had been reimbursed to the banks for the first quarter of 2015. Additionally, he said the government had allocated Rs 4 billion for the same this year.
	Mr. Handunnetti, who spoke for a second time, said banks were acting arbitrarily and heaping conditions onto senior citizens instead of following the government circular pertaining to the proper interest rates and said he hoped that this would change soon. (Yohan Perera and Kelum Bandara)

Commercial Credit growth continues as profits reach Rs.2.1bn
	
		 		 
		 
			
Commercial Credit and Finance PLC, one of Sri Lankas leading finance companies, posted an impressive 108.7 percent growth in net profits for the financial year ended March 31, 2015 to reach Rs.2.1 billion. This set a new milestone for the company, moving up from the Rs.1 billion achieved for the first time in 2013/14.
The results delivered by Commercial Credit for the financial year 2014/15 are extraordinary and will go down in the annals of the history of our company as the year during which we first recorded Rs.2.1 billion in profits. This is all the more creditable in view of the various challenges of differing magnitudes that the leasing and finance sectors experienced during this period, said Commercial Credit Chief Operating Officer Rajiv Casie Chitty.
The companys total customer deposits grew by well over 84.6 percent in the 2014/15 financial year, with 93.7 percent of the growth coming from the fixed deposits segment. Total assets grew from Rs.31.6 billion as at the beginning of the financial year under review to Rs.57.7 billion by year-end.
The interest income reached Rs.11.1 billion for the year under review, recording an increase of 61.2 percent over the previous financial year.
The total lending portfolio grew by 80 percent. The main drivers of this growth were lease and hire purchase and also, microfinance loans which grew by 101.2 and 104.1 percent, respectively.
Our continued efforts to provide customer-centric products and a value-based service ethos have been the corner stones of sustaining this growth momentum over consecutive years. We have been able to win the trust of the people. The growth of our deposit base and loan portfolio is testament to this confidence, Casie Chitty added.
The company also expanded its service network substantially to reach all districts of the country. In the financial year 2014/15 the company extended its service network from 75 to 119 locations. In selecting the locations for expansion, the company not only considered current and future business potential but also the needs of the population in such areas.
With this extended service network, Commercial Credit is well positioned to further develop its business activities. The company is undertaking substantial strategic investments to further strengthen the IT infrastructure of the company. This is a fundamental requirement in view of the growing service network, increasing transaction volumes and growing capabilities and capacities demanded by business needs.
Directors have recommended a final dividend of Rs.1 for the year ended March 31, 2015. This is in addition to an interim dividend paid of 0.50 per share during the year.
In the year under review, the company acquired 96.9 percent of Trade Finance & Investments PLC (TFI), a registered finance company listed on the Colombo Stock Exchange, under the financial sector consolidation programme initiated by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka.

Govt.to prohibit erecting of unauthorised structures in City
	
President Maithripala Sirisena has prohibited the erecting of unauthorised structures on the streets of Colombo and Mayor A.J. Muzammil had also agreed to withdraw the unauthorised pavement boutiques erected recently on three streets in Colombo, Skills Development and Vocational Training Deputy Minister Thilanga Sumathipala said.
He told the media at the SLFP weekly news briefing that Mr. Muzammil had permitted the erection of unauthorised structures on those streets, perhaps because of the influence of some UNP ministers. I spoke to him on the matter and told him it was a dangerous and unlawful to erect unauthorised structures on the pavements of three main roads in the city after former Defence and Urban Development Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa cleared the city streets of unauthorised structures in a bid to beautify Colombo, an action which led to Colombo being named the fastest developing city in the world, Mr. Sumathipala said.
He added that in Mr. Rajapaksas city beautification drive, 3,178 pavement hawkers, who had erected unauthorised structures, were evicted but were given an alternative location to ply their trade. However, 451 pavement traders are still to receive such redress. The Urban Development Authority (UDA) has permitted pavement hawkers to use the areas in front of the Fort and Maradana stations, while in Borella shop owners have complained that their eviction had effected their livelihoods. Their argument is that they were paying for water and electricity at the places from where they were evicted. They had been permitted to use the pavement to erect stalls during the Sinhala  Hindu New Year, Vesak, Christmas and Ramazan festivals etc., he said.
Mr. Sumathipala said after a discussion with President Sirisena, attended by the IGP, the UDA Chairman, the Colombo Mayor and himself, the President had ordered them not to allow the erection of any unauthorised structures in the City of Colombo, taking into account the citys cleanliness.
The UDA, the CMC and the IGP would prepare a report on how pavement hawkers who have not received alternative places to ply their trade would be accommodated and submit it to the President Sirisena, Mr. Sumathipala said. (Sandun A Jayasekera)
