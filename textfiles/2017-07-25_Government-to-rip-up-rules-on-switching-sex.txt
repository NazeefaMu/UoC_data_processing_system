Government to rip up rules on switching sex


	

UK, (Daily Mail), 23 July 2017 -  Adults will be able to choose their sex legally without the need for a medical diagnosis of gender dysphoria under government plans.  

 Men will be able to identify themselves as women - and women as men - and have their birth certificates change to record their new gender.   


Minister for Women and Equalities Justine Greening said she wanted to cut the stigma faced by transpeople.   


At present they have to provide evidence that they have been in transition for at least two years before they can apply to legally change their gender.   


Reforms to help transgender people choose their legal sex, which include speeding up the bureaucratic process, will go out to consultation in the autumn.   


It comes after Prime Minister Theresa May earlier this week suggested she was preparing to reform the Gender Recognition Act.
