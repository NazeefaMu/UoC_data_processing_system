Geetha informs EC of decision to go to SC


	

MP Geetha Kumarasinghe today informed Election Commission (EC) of her decision to appeal to the Supreme Court against Wednesday’s Appeal Court ruling.

Speaking to journalists outside the EC office, Ms. Kumarasinghe said that she had handed over the documents pertaining to the appeal to EC.

“I informed the Speaker of the House and the General Secretary of Parliament about my decision to appeal against the AC ruling. I hope justice will be served by the Supreme Court,” she said.

She said she could have kept her seat in parliamentary if she had no self-respect and joined hands with the government.

However, she said she could still serve the people as she had not lost her seat yet. “We have lodged an appeal against the verdict. Therefore, I still have time and will not lose the seat until the Supreme Court delivers its ruling on the appeal,” she said.  

The Appeal Court issued a verdict on Wednesday, disqualifying MP Geetha Kumarasinghe from holding on to her seat in Parliament as she has violated the Constitution by failing to notify Parliament that she had dual-citizenship. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
