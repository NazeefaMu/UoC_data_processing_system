A certain purohita has made secret plans to become the team leader at the top table in yahapalanaya, they say.

 


This ambitious one hailing from the hill country had his first break under yahapalanaya when he was given a seat in the council from the gratis list. He was once lambasting his former boss, but now he has stopped saying anything against the latter as a tactical measure, they say. Incidentally, the man got into hot water once for shooting off mouth.


According to reports, our worthy had held several rounds of talks with reps from three political parties at a joint in Battaramulla area to fine-tune the roadmap leading to his goal. 


“If I gained this position, reaching the apex would only be a matter of course,” the ambitious one had bragged after a drink or two.
