Brining new inspiration whilst preserving the true sense of Avurudu spirit, the Bankers to the Nation, Bank of Ceylon (BOC) invites customers to conduct Avurudu Ganu-Denu for the Sinhala and Tamil New Year on April 15, 2016.


As always, keeping up with the Sri Lankan traditions, the bank will be serving traditional Avurudu refreshments to all its customers on that day to celebrate Avurudu Ganu-Denu with BOC. Preserving the national traditions, the bank wishes to encourage every Sri Lankan to celebrate the Sinhala and Tamil Avurudu more meaningfully with their families following the New Year auspicious times that fall on April 13.


The bank invites all its valuable customers to come with their families, especially their children, on April 15 to experience this tradition of Ganu-Denu and receive gifts for Ran-Kekulu accounts ranging from Dialogue Suraksha phones, cricket bats, educational toys - loom band sets, Grade 5 scholarship paper sets, Atlas map books, remote control cars and stylish dolls set with accessories.
The bank hopes to encourage children to cultivate the habit of saving this Avurudu season through this valuable gift scheme. BOC will keep this offer open through its islandwide branch network until stocks last. Customers can enjoy these special Avurudu gifts by opening a new Ran-Kekulu account or depositing money to an existing account at any BOC branch. 
BOC wishes all its customers and all Sri Lankans a Happy and a Prosperous New Year!
