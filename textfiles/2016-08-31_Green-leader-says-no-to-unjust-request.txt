Green leader says ‘no’ to unjust request


	



 

A request was made to the second in command in yahapalanaya at the Green party’s Diyawanna group meeting the other day to transfer out the Matale District Secretary forthwith. 

 


The request came from a member of the Aluvihare clan who charged that the white-collar high-up was an errand girl of the Rajapaksas.


The party leader who was in the chair explained that the District Secretaries could not be moved about as they pleased and they had to observe the proper procedure adding that the member should speak to the Minister concerned to have his problem sorted out. The member who was not satisfied with this response insisted that the District Secretary be sent out of Matale without further delay. 
Unhappy that his request had gone unheeded, the member as he sat down said it appeared that he had no other alternative but to seek a solution to his problem from a Rajapaksa. 


Reacting to the member’s barb, the party leader said it was well known as to who was maintaining a rapport with the Rajapaksas and who was visiting whom in the recent past. The party leader also had rebuked the member for his irresponsible conduct.
