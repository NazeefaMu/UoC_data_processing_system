Britain’s Defence Secretary threatens  Theresa May


	

UK, (Daily Mail), 23 June 2018 -Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson has threatened to sweep Theresa May from power in a bitter Cabinet row over military cuts.  


Furious Mr Williamson warned the Prime Minister that if she did not commit an extra £20 billion to the Ministry of Defence then Tory MPs would vote down the next Budget – effectively passing a motion of no confidence in her.  


‘I made her – and I can break her,’ Mr Williamson is said to have boasted to service chiefs.   
The furore, described by one Williamson ally as a ‘dogfight at the heart of Government’, erupted after Mrs May announced a £20 billion-a-year boost to NHS spending last week.   


Chancellor Philip Hammond then declared there was no money left for similar boosts to defence, housing or schools spending.   When Mr Williamson said he needed his own £20 billion – a minimum of £2 billion a year extra for the next decade – to avoid damaging defence cuts, Mrs May questioned whether the UK had to be a ‘tier one’ military power.
