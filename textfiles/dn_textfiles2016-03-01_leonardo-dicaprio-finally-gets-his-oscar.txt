Leonardo DiCaprio finally gets his Oscar!

 
US: After four previous misses, Leonardo DiCaprio won his first Oscar for his grunting, gruff performance in The Revenant.
'Making The Revenant was about man's relationship to the natural world...climate change is real,' said DiCaprio as he used his acceptance speech to deliver a lecture on the environment. 'It is happening right now. It is the most urgent threat facing our entire species and we need to work collectively together and stop procrastinating.'
'Let us not take our planet for granted,' he concluded. 'I do not take tonight for granted.'
While an advocate for addressing the threat of climate change, 41-year-old DiCaprio was reported to have taken six private jet flights in just six weeks in 2014. It may prove hard for the actor to justify the need to avail himself of more than $200,000 worth of private travel between LA and New York in such a short period of time.
He was then nominated for Best Actor (The Aviator) in 2004. He later earned a Best Actor nod for Blood Diamond in 2006. And most recently for the Wolf Of Wall Street in 2013.
Alejandro Inarritu took best director for a second straight year, a feat matched by only two other filmmakers: John Ford and Joseph L. Mankiewicz. His brutal frontier epic The Revenant, which came in with a leading 12 nods and the favorite for best picture, also won best cinematography for Emmanuel Lubezki. Renowned for his use of natural light in lengthy, balletic shots, Lubezki became the first cinematographer to win three times in a row (following wins for Gravity and Birdman), and only the seventh to three-peat in Oscar history.
Inarritu, the Mexican director of last year's best-picture winner Birdman, was one of the few winners to remark passionately on diversity in his speech.

DiCaprio's success for his grueling star turn as 19th century fur trapper Hugh Glass came 22 years after his first of four unsuccessful acting nominations. For the 41-year-old actor, the fifth time was a charm.
