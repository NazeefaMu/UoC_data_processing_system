US, (Daily Mail), 10 July 2018 -  Donald Trump risked sparking a diplomatic incident today ahead of his visit to the UK by saying the country is ‘in turmoil’ and refusing to endorse Theresa May as PM.  
The US president said it was ‘up to the people’ of Britain to decide whether Mrs May stayed on in Downing Street.  


He also heaped praise on his ‘friend’ Boris Johnson - who dramatically resigned from government yesterday over Brexit - and suggested he could meet him during the trip.   


The comment comes just days before he is due to fly into the country for a long-awaited working visit.  


There are already fears of tensions, after he publicly clashed with Mrs May over criticism of crime levels in London, the performance of the NHS, and retweeting posts from a far-right group.  Speaking to journalists as he set off for a Europe, Mr Trump said there were a ‘lot of things’ going on in the UK at the moment and the country seemed to be ‘somewhat in turmoil’.   ‘The UK certainly has a lot of things going on,’ he said.   


‘Boris Johnson’s a friend of mine. He’s been very, very nice to me. 
Very supportive.
