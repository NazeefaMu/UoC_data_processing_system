The Bodu Jana Peramuna (BJP), the political wing of the Bodu Bala Sena (BBS), has requested the Elections Commissioner to rename their party as the United Sinhale People’s Front (USPF), its Secretary Nath Amarakoon said today.
He said the request was made three weeks ago and the intention of changing the name was to specifically include the term ‘Sinhale’ into the name of the party.
He said the BBS which previously contested at the General Elections as BJP would be contesting individually at the upcoming local government elections as the USPF once it received the approval of the Elections Commissioner. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)
