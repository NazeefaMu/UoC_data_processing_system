Doha: Qatar Foreign Ministry has urged nationals not to travel to Sri Lanka due to health concern. They have put out a travel warning on their official Twitter page urging people not to visit Sri Lanka as H1N1 is reportedly spreading throughout the Central province, which includes Kandy, a favourite tourist spot.

A leading university in the province, Peradeniya University, has shut down indefinitely due to the spread of the viral flu.

The Qatar Foreign Ministry in their tweet said that the Sri Lankan official authorities have confirmed the spread of swine flu (H1N1) in Sri Lanka. Many people are infected with the disease and also many deaths are reported due to the flu.
