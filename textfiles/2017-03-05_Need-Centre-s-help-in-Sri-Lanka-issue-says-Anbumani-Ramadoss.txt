Citing the report of United Nations Human Rights Commissioner  Zeid Raad Al Hussein accusing Sri Lanka of failing to comply with the commission’s resolutions for hybrid mechanism to probe the war crimes and return of army occupied lands to Tamils, PMK youth wing leader Anbumani Ramadoss on Saturday asked the Union government to take the issue to the UN security council to ensure justice for Tamils.

The high commissioner had stated that the island government is very slow in implementing the UNHCR resolutions and the ministers are speaking in different voices about them.

The laws of the Lankan government should be amended to facilitate a hybrid mechanism for an enquiry into the war crimes and withdrawal of military from all civilian affairs, Anbumani said, quoting the report.

He also said the report had sought the setting up of an office for UNHCR in Lanka and signing of the international treaty for probing genocide and war crimes, besides the withdrawal of anti-terrorism laws.

The high commissioner had accused the island government of trying to avoid punishment for the guilty and insisted on implementation of its recommendations.
Anbumani said the report had made it clear that the Lankan government is trying to deny justice for Tamils and the international community should not fall prey to such deceptions.

He said the Union government should not try to save the Lankan government, but bring a resolution at the UNHCR meeting on March 22 to implement the UNHCR resolutions within a time frame, besides taking the issue to the security council.(Deccan Chronicle)
