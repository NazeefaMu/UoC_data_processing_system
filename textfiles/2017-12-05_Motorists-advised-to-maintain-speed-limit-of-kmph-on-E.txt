Motorists who travel on the Southern Expressway (E01) are advised to maintain a speed limit of 60kmph due to the prevalent adverse weather, Southern Expressway Deputy Director R.A.D. Kahatapitiya said.

Speaking to Daily Mirror, Mr. Kahatapitiya said warnings would be displayed via Variable Message Sign (VMS) boards along the expressway.

“These boards will display the speed limit and weather condition. There is no way of declaring a minimum speed limit on expressways, but we have displayed these warnings for the safety of drivers,” he said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)
