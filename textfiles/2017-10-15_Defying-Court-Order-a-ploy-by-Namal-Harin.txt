UPFA MP Namal Rajapaksa led the recent protest in Hambantota by defying the court order with a political game in mind, Minister Harin Fernando said today.

He said this at a public meeting organised by the UNP at Baddegama today.

"Namal Rajapaksa's recent statement that he is a political prisoner is a part of this game to deceive the people and a subtle ploy gain their sympathy," the minister said adding that there was no other reason for Mr. Rajapaksa to go ahead with the protest rally despite the stay order.

"He is actually having a practice sessions in prison. Mr Rajapaksa and several others will have to go to prison for a long time when the disclosures of more instances of fraud and corruption surfaces in the coming days," the minister said. (Yohan Perera)
