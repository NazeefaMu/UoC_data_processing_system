Govt. must make responsible statement on C.V.’s allegations: JHU


	

The Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) said today the Government must make a responsible statement with regard to the false and baseless statements made by Northern Province Chief Minister on resettlement of Sinhalese in the North and constructing of places of worship without having backbenches to do so.

JHU national organiser Nishantha Sri Warnasinghe said the government must make a statement with facts and figures as the international community may be misled by these baseless allegations.

“The government must reveal how many Sinhala families had been resettled in the North and how many Buddhist statues have been built and places of worship of other religions like Muslim and Christians. If not the international community may think that Sinhalese are invading the North,” he said.

Mr. Warnasinghe said about 20,000 Sinhala people had been living in the North according to the census conducted in 1971 and added that less than 5000 Sinhalese had been registered for resettlement there.

“Only 110 families were resettled in Nawakkuli and most of them have already left there due to intimidation while only 33 Sinhala families went to Nari Kaadu for resettlement. Sinhalese and Muslims were chased away from the North during the war,” he said.

He said baseless statements of Mr. Wigneswaran were a hindrance to the reconciliation effort by the government.

“The Central Bank Governor, Chief Justice and Opposition Leader are all Tamils but Sinhala people had not protested against them being appointed to such posts. But Mr. Wigneswaran is trying to hinder this political reconciliation,” he said. (Ajith Siriwardana)
