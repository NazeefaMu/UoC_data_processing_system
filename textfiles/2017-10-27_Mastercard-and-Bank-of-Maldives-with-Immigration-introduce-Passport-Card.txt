Maldives President Abdulla Yameen introduced the Mastercard Passport Card to the cabinet ministers at his office recently.


The top cabinet ministers and department heads such as the economic development minister, home affairs minister, defence and national security minister, finance and treasury minister, foreign affairs minister, tourism minister, attorney general, chief of defence force, customs commissioner general, Maldives immigration controller general, Bank of Maldives CEO along with Mastercard Country Manager for Sri Lanka and the Maldives R.B. Santosh Kumar were present at the occasion.


Maldives Passport Card is a Mastercard biometric debit card issued by the Bank of Maldives. It is a dual- interface chip card with additional features and applications. It is the first payment card in the world by a network which has the passport, national ID and driving licence of the cardholder in one plastic card. 


The Mastercard Passport Card can be used for a wide range of purposes/services. Primarily, the Passport Card is an identity travel document complying with the ICAO data standards allowing it to be used at e-gates at Male International Airport. Additionally, it can be used for identity verification by law enforcement agencies. It can also be used to provide government services such as medical services and other e-services.


The card can be utilized as a special insurance card when required, for cashless health insurance services and motor insurance policy verification. The Mastercard Passport Card is the world’s first bank card, which is made of polycarbonate material that can last up to 10 years. The flexibility of the Passport Card allows additional services and information to be incorporated to the card. E-services such as e-transport, academic information, medical information and many more can be included. For added security, the card will contain the biometric data of the cardholder, such as fingerprints. 


The card is certified by Mastercard and the Bank of Maldives allowing the cardholders to use it internationally like any other Mastercard. The additional passport security features makes the card more secure than any other payment card in the market today. This streamlined solution reduces the need to carry other documents and provides the cardholder with a secure and convenient method of payment. Commenting on the Passport Card, Mastercard Country Manager Sri Lanka and Maldives R.B. Santosh Kumar said, “We are honoured to have presented the Passport Card to the president. At Mastercard, we are focused on providing our customers with innovative payment solutions and enhanced payment experiences. Hence, we believe that by introducing a Passport Card with the Government of Maldives we will be reducing hassle and improving overall experiences. And by incorporating the payment method into such vital documentation, it will help facilitate greater financial inclusion.”
