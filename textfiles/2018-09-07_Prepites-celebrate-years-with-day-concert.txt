Choral activity in Sri Lanka has risen to an unprecedented level during the past number of years, following a growing interest in the field with the student community in Sri Lanka being largely responsible for the recognition that choirs and choral events gain.  

Displaying a vast array of talents, innovative dynamics, creative arrangements and exploring boundaries of traditional and contemporary music, school choirs have thrilled and amazed audiences for countless years in the past.  

The S. Thomas’ Preparatory School Choir is one such choir, home to many talented and energetic youngsters from the ages of 11 to 16 years as it provides a platform for these students to express their creativity through music and arts. The 35+ number of Choristers each dabble in various genres of music from Gospel to Rock to Pop as they are trained to be versatile not only in their music, but in their approach to music as a practice for life and its challenges.
