Muhurthas for marriage and marital happiness-part 2

 

 

In our previous article on the subject, we referred to ancient Indian sage Vashista’s assertion that the marriage Navamsa Ascendant is more important than the marriage Rashi Ascendant in the context of producing results relating to Muhurthas. 

Muhurtha results in different Rashi and Navamsa Ascendants
The principles Kalidasa enunciates in his work titled Purvakalmrita lends support to what Vashista has said. Kalidasa says that the marriage occurring in the Aries Navamsa is destined to end in separation. Marriage in Taurus Navamsa bestows wealth and prosperity on the bride. In Cancer Navamsa she turns unfaithful.  In Leo Navamsa, the bride spends more time at the parental home than with her husband.


In Virgo Navamsa, the bride gains wealth and spiritual advancement.  Marriage in this Navamsa, assures a virtuous bride who brings forth sons who would hold key positions in the administration of the state. The bride in Scorpio Navamsa becomes poor and is neglected by her husband and all others.  In Sagittarius up to 15 degrees, she gains wealth and in the second part of Sagittarius she becomes unchaste. In Capricorn, she is uncouth and is disliked by others.  In Aquarius, she becomes a sickly person and an early widow. In Pisces, she is childless and miserable.   


Muhurtha Chintamani, a classical work on Muhurthas recommends only Gemini, Libra and Sagittarius and Pisces as auspicious Navamsa Ascendants.

Exceptions to general Muhurtha Lagna rule
Aries, Cancer, Pisces and second part of Sagittarius - from 16 to 30 degrees are considered inauspicious for Muhurthas both as Rashi and Navamsa Ascendants, according to ancient treatises on Muhurtha.  However, ancient works on Muhurthas, Muhurtha Martanda these three signs become auspicious if they are Vargottama. However, it has to be noted that Pisces Ascendant falling between 20 degrees 40 Kalas and 30 degrees and 6 Kalas is malefic and this period should be avoided in selecting a Muhurtha. 


Libra is normally considered auspicious as both marriage Muhurtha Ascendant and Navamsa Ascendant. However, according to Muhurtha Martanda, Vargottama Libra is bad for marriage. 

Pushkaramsa
There are specifically benefic degrees of signs called Subha Pushkaramsas which are auspicious as Muhurthas.  In Aries, Leo and Sagittarius 21 degrees is Subha Pushkaramsa. In Taurus, Virgo and Capricorn 14 degrees is the Subha Pushkaramsa. In Gemini, Libra, and Aquarius 24 degrees and in Cancer Scorpio and Pisces 9 degrees are the Pushkaramsa.

Virgo Ascendant, best for Muhurthas
According to all ancient Indian sages, Virgo is the best Ascendant of all the 12 signs. So we now know that we cannot select a better Muhurtha than that falls in the 14 degrees in the 14 degrees of the Virgo Ascendant. However, even such a Muhurtha becomes inauspicious if Mars happens to be in the 8th House.

Kranti Samya Dosha
Sun and Moon transiting in Zodiacal signs cause the Kranti Samya Dosha. This Dosha is considered highly detrimental to marriage. 


Kranti Samya Dosha is caused when:
Sun is in Leo and Moon is in Aries.
Either Sun or Moon is in a Chara (Movable) Rashi, the other is in the 9th from it or Either Sun or Moon is in Diviswabha - Common sign, the other is in the 7th Rashi from it.
