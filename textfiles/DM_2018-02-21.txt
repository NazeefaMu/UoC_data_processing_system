A citizens view of LG elections Taxpayers money wasted, to feel the pulse of the voter
	
It is becoming overwhelmingly clear that politicization has ruined the achievement of the key objectives of holding an LG election. For example, in the process of garnering votes, one party was solely exploiting the image of its charismatic political leader; another party was hammering out its exclusive power to allocate funds for local development; another party was taking advantage of the countrys Executive President while still another party was begging for power by labeling the two major parties as thieves.
No party stressed on their plans to develop the wards, and ultimately the whole election process costing billions of tax payers money merely produced a so called red light to the governing party leading to a setback for the countrys economy with rumblings of political instability. If the major objective of holding an election was to feel the pulse of the voter, such objective could have easily been achieved at a much lower cost through robust, independent Opinion polls conducted by esteemed organizations as regularly carried out in other countries. It is only a matter of such opinion polls becoming acceptable to the people over the years. 
In addition, the complexities involved in the imported Mixed Voting system have sent the Election Commission into a tail-spin! For example several Over-hang situations arising from voter results have caused the already excessive number of 8,356 to increase further. What about the excess that can arise when going to meet the 25% women requirement It will surely add insult to injury leading to voter expectations going haywire.
On the contrary, local council rates and other taxes will have to be raised to maintain this coterie of unproductive politicians, who will in competition, enrich themselves via bribery and corruption! Why are the simple voters allowed to be taken for a ride by a bunch of power-seeking politicians in a country where media freedom is entrenched To use a pun, we must hang the perpetrators of this imported Mixed voting system creating Hang-overs for the voters with the resultant Over-hangs!!! 
In this scenario, the best solution to meet the objective of facilitating grass root level development of a ward is to depoliticise the local government election and follow the Gam Sabha system to attract honourable and helpful persons like retired teachers, JPs and other socially acceptable individuals from each ward to contest. The Election Commission shall lay down the eligibility criteria for applicants. In the meanwhile, concerted action must be taken to improve the public service, Judiciary and the Police service through proper training and effective deployment to minimize voters seeking outside assistance to meet their needs. The explicit features of a depoliticized election over and above the positive features of the Mixed Voting system can be enumerated as follows. 
1)The advent of independent facilitators at ward level will guarantee the achievement of the real objectives of LG elections. 
2)A very simple and straight forward election process with a minimal cost burden to the tax payer is ensured. 
3)The exact number of members to be elected to each ward is predetermined by the Elections Commission without overhangs. 
4)Post polls violence and attendant wasteful expenditure such as tamashas and lighting fire crackers will be zero or negligible. 
5)The Government Machinery and the citizenry in general can function as usual, sans any stability issues. 
In the case of Provincial and General Elections, the simple alternative is to replace the obnoxious preference voting system with merit-wise nomination lists and adduce equal value to votes at provincial and national level as the case may be. I have dealt with the bolts and nuts of this solution in my previous submissions to the press and the relevant authorities. 
No doubt, to achieve this transformation, a strong Elections Commission, a patriotic political will and an unbiased media culture with the countrys development at its heart to educate the public are imperative. Let us learn from the Mixed-voting experiment.

A poll day comedy
	

This is a drama that unfolded at a Buddhist temple in a city suburb on the recentlocal poll day.

The dharmasala of this temple was one of the public places used in the area as a polling booth. There is a large pond lying by the side of the path leading to the dharmasala. This pond dotted with lotus flowers in bloom and in bud is a beautiful scene to behold these days.
This pond became a great attraction to the voters on polling day and they would feast their eyes on the pond as they walked past it to the polling booth.
A Green party activist observed that the voters on their way to the polling booth were watching the lotus flower pond with great admiration and it suddenly struck his mind with the impact of a hammer blow the significance of the lotus flower - the lotus bud was the symbol of a rival political party and the pond was a veritable advertisement for that party at a psychological moment!
The Green activist lost no time informing the party candidate in the area about the pond advertising thelotus bud.
The candidate who got highly agitated rushed to the temple and lodged his protest against the voters having to walk past the lotus pond on their way to the polling booth. He did not listen to the explanation that the presence of the lotus pond was something purely accidental and there was no other access to the polling booth. The election officials and the incumbent monk who were highly disconcerted by this unexpected development were looking for a solution to save the situation when one of them came out with a brain wave. He turned to the candidate and told him: Its too late for us to shift the polling booth elsewhere or change the path leading to this place. Your grouse is that the lotus pond is a reminder of a party symbol. Why dont you plant a symbol of your own party near the pond so that the voters will notice thatas well
The candidate having agreed to this suggestion rushed to a shop close by, bought a figure of an elephant and placed it by the side of the lotus pond. Thus an ugly scene that could have occurred at this polling boothwas averted!
However, the bell party activists who heard about the incident had made a protest against planting an elephant figure by the pond side, they say.

A real life hero in the making
	

Believe it or not! There is a purohita who had spent a whopping Rs.150 million to win votes at the recent local poll.

This purohita known to have cleared swaths of a forest reserve to open up new settlements is a leader of minorpolitical party.
Several thousands of poor families in the district had received financial assistance, hundreds of youth received laptops and three wheel drivers given three tyres each while his close associates had their electricity bills settled thanks to the sudden burst of generosity of this purohita, they say.
This purohita, a hero of a rags-to-riches story in local politics, of late, inspired by main characters in some South Indian films has developed a penchant to give away his wealth to the poor and the needy.

Adjusting to the way the wind is blowing
	

The former strongman, overjoyed at the poll results, was having a well-earned rest at his official residence when he got a telephone call.

A familiar voice that greeted him was hailing his success at the polls. Sir, I hope you can recognize my voice You are the only person who can save us and our party the person at the other end was saying in a pathetic tone.
By now, the former strongman had made out the caller as a politico hailing from the central hills who served as a purohita in his regime as well. The former strongman gave an attentive ear, eager to know what his erstwhile colleague wanted to say.
It was an earnest appeal to him to take over the entire Blue party under his protective wing!
The former strongman ended the call saying, Let us meet soon for a chat about it!
Later the former strongman apprised the Pohottuwa loyalists of the overture made by the senior one from the central hills. They were unanimous in their instant reaction. Give the fellow a wide berth!
They reminded the former boss how their former colleague had been castigating him at the recent poll meetings.
However, the Pohottuwa crowd after a lengthy discussion had asked their boss to have a chat with the man just to find out what the game he was up to, they say.

Amana Bank profits surge over higher margins and new loans
	
Amana Bank PLC reported an improved financial performance for the fourth quarter ended in December 2017 (4Q17), as Sri Lankas first non-interest based Islamic bank stretched its financing margin while modestly expanding its asset base.
The interim results filed with the Colombo Stock Exchange showed the bank reporting earnings of 13 cents a share on total profit of Rs.236 million for the 4Q17, recovering from a loss of Rs.61 million reported in the same quarter in 2016.
The bank recorded notable improvement in the core-banking performance for the period as the net financing income rose by a stronger 51.5 percent year-on-year (YoY) to Rs.794.7 million for the quarter.
The term net financing income at Amana Bank refers to the net interest income in the general banking terms.
The financing margin or the difference between the return of the banks assets and the cost of the deposits and other funds rose to 4.2 percent in 2017 from 3.6 percent a year ago, providing a much needed fillip to the bottom line performance. 
During the year, Amana Bank issued 1.25 billion new shares at Rs.3.80 to its existing shareholder, Islamic Corporation for the Development of the Private Sector (ICD), the fund manager of IB Growth Fund (Labuan) LLP  (IBGF) to raise Rs.4.75 billion.
This enabled the bank with an equity capital base of Rs.10.1 billion by the end of 2017, to surpass the minimum capital of Rs.10 billion required to be met by January 1, 2018.
However, the bank now braces for Rs.20 billion in core-capital, by the end of 2021, which requires the bank to double its existing capital within a matter of 4 years.
The share sale, which took place under special approval from the Monetary Board, as one party crossed the single shareholder limit resulted in IB Growth Fund (Labuan) LLP holding 23.65 percent stake in Amana Bank by the year end.
Meanwhile, for the year ended December 31, 2017, the bank reported earnings of 29 cents or Rs.502.8 million against an earnings of just 3 cents a share or Rs.40.6 million in total earnings in 2016. The net financing income for the year rose by 43 percent to Rs.2.75 billion.
During the year the bank expanded its gross loans or financing and receivables to other customers by Rs.4.7 billion registering a modest growth of 12.1 percent.
By the end of December, the bank had a total gross loan portfolio of Rs. 43.4 billion.
Asset quality ended a tad weaker with gross non-performing loan ratio at 1.89 percent from 0.89 percent a year earlier. Meanwhile, the deposits rose by Rs.4.0 billion or 8.5 percent to Rs.50.9 billion.
By the year end the bank had a total asset base of Rs.63.5 billion, up 17 percent during the year. Amana Bank currently operates with 742 staff and 28 branches.

Bombs still fall on Syrias Ghouta after heaviest toll in years
	

THE HINDU, 20th FEBRUARY, 2018- Pro-government forces carried air raids in Syrias eastern Ghouta rebel-held enclave overnight on Monday and early on Tuesday after the heaviest one-day death toll from bombardment there in three years, a war monitor said.
More than 100 people were killed in air raids, rocket strikes and shelling of the area near Damascus on Monday, said the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.
The United Nations called for an immediate ceasefire in the area on Monday, saying the situation was spiralling out of control after an extreme escalation in hostilities.
The violence in eastern Ghouta is part of a wider escalation in warfare on several fronts in Syria in recent months as President Bashar al-Assad pushes to end the seven-year rebellion against him. Mr. Assads most powerful ally, Russia, has been pushing a diplomatic track at the same time as the increase in fighting, resulting in the establishment of several de-escalation zones.
Eastern Ghouta is in one of these areas, where violence is meant to be contained, but the agreement does not include a former al Qaeda affiliate which has a small presence there.
Other insurgent groups in eastern Ghouta, including Islamist factions, say the Syrian government and Russia are using the jihadist presence as a pretext to continue their bombardment.

Country facing huge crisis: JO
	
The country was facing a huge crisis with the amendments made to the Local Authorities Elections (Amendment) Act on several grounds, including the implementation of the 25 percent quota for women, the Joint Opposition said today.
Joint Opposition member MP Gamini Lokuge told a news conference that the country was now heading towards a confusion following the delay of releasing the results of the Local Government elections, proving the inability of the Government to function as a responsible body.
He said the Elections Commission had failed to issue the final results of the Local Government elections, even after several weeks of the elections.
Following these conditions, the country comes to a standstill and is heading towards confusion.
The Elections Commission, the Subject Minister and the Government should be held responsible for this situation, he added.
He said the Government should immediately go for Parliamentary Elections, considering the peoples mandate, given in the LG elections in order to solve the current crisis.
He said the term of the National Unity Government had ended with the completion of two years and the Ministers currently in the Government were not valid as per the provisions of the Constitution.
Joint Opposition member MP Ranjith Zoysa said swearing in of the newly elected members of the local authorities had been delayed for a long period as never before.
He added that because of the delay the members would have to provide their service for one year without any allowance. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

DFCC Bank Dec. profits up on modest core banking performance, better margins
	
Modest performance in core-banking operations, better margin management and fee incomes helped DFCC Bank PLC to beat the odds during the quarter ended December 31, 2017 (4Q17), the interim financial accounts released to the Colombo bourse showed.
The development lender turned fully fledged commercial bank reported Rs.5.84 a share or Rs.1.03 billion in total earnings for the 4Q17, up 35 percent year-on-year (YoY)
The net interest income rose by 17 percent YoY to Rs.3.13 billion while the fee and commission income rose by a strong 34 percent YoY to Rs.482 million outweighing the hefty other operating loss of Rs.809 million charged from the profits.
At yesterdays close, DFCC Banks share ended Rs.3.20 higher at Rs.122.00.
Meanwhile, for the year ended December 31, 2017, the bank reported earnings of Rs.16.45 a share or Rs.4.4 billion in after-tax profits, up 28 percent YoY.
The net interest income rose by 27 percent YoY to Rs.11.4 billion. The bank on a standalone basis expanded its loans and receivables book by Rs.29 billion during the year to Rs.221 billion, registering a growth of 15 percent.
While this is by and large in line with the industrys private credit growth for the year, the banks loan growth came to virtually half that of the deposit growth for the period.
The deposits grew by Rs.53 billion or 38 percent for the year to end the portfolio with Rs.193 billion.
The bank managed to improve the low cost deposit base slightly as the bank has received a foreign currency deposits equivalent of Rs.12billion. As a result of this imbalance in the deposits and loans, the bank ended the year with a substantial amount of excess liquidity.
The bank recently announced its plans to raise Rs.7.0 billion in a 7-year convertible debenture to stay ahead of the BASEL III minimum capital levels.
The bank also managed to increase the net interest margin to 3.6 percent from 3.3 percent a year ago.
When the interest rates rise, the banks stretch their margins as they can charge higher for loans than the deposits as a large section of bank loans are booked at floating rates.
DFFC Banks asset quality remains sound as the gross non-performing loan ratio improved to 2.77 percent from 2.97 percent in 2016. 
By the end of December the bank on a standalone basis had a total asset base of Rs.333.1 billion, up 15 percent.
Sri Lankas government holds little over 35 percent in DFCC Bank through Bank of Ceylon, Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation, Employees Provident Fund and the Employees Trust Fund.
Hatton National Bank PLC has a 12.22 percent stake in DFCC Bank being the second largest shareholder.

After much insistence the secretarial one had told him: Machang, they ought to know that I am not a nonentity in our alliance and have some regard at least for my position. Prodded on, he had continued: Firecrackers started exploding in the front yard of my house soon after the first few election results were announced I soon found out that it was the henchmen of our former boss who were throwing them into our compound How can I have any truck with people who tried to humiliate me in this fashion

Indian Bank ramping up overseas ops in Sri Lanka, Singapore
	
BUSINESS STANDARD: Public sector Indian Bank has undertaken initiatives to increase business at its overseas branches in Sri Lanka and Singapore, a top official has said.
Our operations (in overseas) are actually profitable. We have started ramping up activities in both the centres, the banks Managing Director and CEO, Kishor Kharat told PTI.
He said the bank had taken steps to increase business levels as there was slight stagnancy earlier (in the bank operations).
Having understood the policies, we are in a position to grow in the Singapore market. In the nine-month period (ending December 31, 2017) alone, our business there improved by (R.s 13 billion) Rs. 1,300 crore, he said.
By end of the current fiscal, the business levels in Singapore will be increased by Rs. 15 billion to Rs 16 billion, he said.
On the Sri Lankan operations, Kharat said the business in the two branches grew by Rs 1.5 billion as of December 2017.
Sri Lankan operations are slightly smaller than Singapore operations. Before March (2018), we will be in a position to show a growth of close to Rs. 5 billion there.
On whether the bank was looking at expanding overseas presence, he said two branches were planned, one each in Dubai and other a overseas banking operation branch in Ahmedabad.
We have applied for two licenses. One, we are planning to open in AFC Dubai and the other at GIFT (Gujarat International Finance Tec-City), Ahmedabad. It will be overseas banking operation branch, he said.
On diluting the government stake in the bank as per SEBI regulations, Kharat said there was enough time for that and the bank would raise funds at the opportune time.
Government of India has not given us any capital. We have adequate capital. Today Government of India has 81.87 percent holding in bank.
As per SEBI regulations, we have to bring it down to less than 75 percent. To comply with SEBI, we will have to come out with issuance of fresh equity, he said.
Kharat said for fund raising there was time for the bank.
There is still time for us. By next financial year, we have to comply with the guidelines (of SEBI). So when the market is good and when there is opportune time, we will be raising some funds, he said.
To a query about Non-Performing Assets, he said the bank was able to contain NPA in the last one year and planned to bring down the Gross NPA to less than six per cent and Net NPA to less than three per cent.

International Mother Language Day Multilingualism and National Development
	
As a Sri Lankan, I feel happy to be in Bangladesh on the UNESCO Mother Language Day for two simple reasons. Firstly, I belong to the ethnic group known as the Sinhalese who trace their origins to your land which was then called Vanga. Vanga is the name used in Pali chronicles written in the fifth century ACE.
To share our experience as two multilingualnation-states in achieving acommon goal
	Vijaya who was the grandson of alion, Sinha
	Multilingual nations ran into conflict
	Mother language ..an important symbol of ethnic identity
	Sri Lanka and Pakistan are two classic examples
The Sinhalese call themselves Sinhala because they believe that they descend from a prince named Vijaya who was the grandson of a lion, Sinha, who roamed the jungles of Vanga. Hence the symbol of the lion in our national flag.
Vanga has been identified as the land that covers the modern State of West Bengal and modern Bangladesh. In the distant past, Vanga was not a part of Bharat (India). It was an independent kingdom, which was not included among the sixteen maha-janapadas (great states) mentioned in Buddhist literature. I have a feeling that Bengal was made a part and parcel of India by the East India Company of England in the mid-18th century.
East Bengal region, present-day Bangladesh writes Prof. AfiaDil, is an ancient land historically known as Bang (Vang) as part of the vast delta of the river Padma open to tidal waves from the bay and people used to build al (a ridge for protecting against floods) and thus the area came to be known as Bang-al. In the pre-Christian era Rig Veda, the name appears as Vanga. It was during the British period in the mid-18th century that it came to be spelt as Bengal. It was known along with Babylon, Egypt and China as an area rich in cross-cultural heritage and inter-cultural contacts by land and sea routes. It is a historical fact that in ancient times, the region was not looked upon as part of the so-called Bharat (India) but more a part of Eastern Asia. (Bengali Nursery Rhymes, p. 12)
So today, I am happy to be back in my ancestral land, Vanga, to see my distant relatives.
Secondly, as a child, I used to sing a Sinhala folk song that has a reference to a country called Bangalade:se: which I think is our name for your country even before you began to call your country, Bangladesh. The folk song is a dialogue composed of two questions and two answers. The first question and answer run thus in Sinhala:
Olinda tibenne: koykoyde:se
Olinda tibenne: bangalide:se.
(Where do you find liquorice
Liquorice is found in bangalide:se:
The second question and answer run thus:
Genathhadanne: koykoyde:se
Genathhadanne: Sinhala de:se:
(Where do you plant liquorice
It is planted in sinhalade:se:)
This folk song refers to a kind of seed known as liquorice, olinda. One wants to find out where olinda grows. He is told that olinda grows in Bangla-desh. Then he is asked where it will be planted He is told that it will be planted in Sinhala-de:se, the land of the Sinhalese.
I am at a loss to understand the precise meaning of this dialogue. It implies that liquorice grows in abundance in Bangali-de:se, and that it will be brought from there and planted in Sinhala-de:se. What matters is that it refers to a land (de:se) called Bangli,Bangla-de:sh.
It also refers to a land called Sinhala-de:se, the land of the Sinhala. Sri Lanka has been calledSinhala dvipa (Island of the Sinhalese) in the past. So this is a folk poem that links our two lands.
Liquorice, sometimes called Indian liquorice, (Abrusprecatorius) is a creeper that bears a red coloured seed that is used in a folk game known as olindakeliya, which was once very popular among women of the royalty. Fifty-six seeds are used in this game which is played on a wooden board that has 14 holes in two rows (seven in each row).
I call myself a Sinhalese, not because of my blood or my facial features, but because Sinhala happened to be my mother tongue. If my mother was Tamil by ethnicity, I would have learnt Tamil as my mother tongue and I would think of myself as a Tamil.

These seeds were also used as the smallest of jewellers weights. Was there any kind of game in Bangladesh using liquorice
Today we are here on a mission: to share our experience as two multilingual nation-states in achieving a common goal: national development. We meet here on a day of special significance, the UNESCO Mother Language Day, a day that gave birth to a new nation, Bangladesh.
In this paper, I will focus my attention on four main themes: language as the most distinctive feature of the human race, language as a symbol of ethnic identity, multilingualism, and finally, national development.
Language as the most distinctive feature of mankind
Language is the most distinctive feature of the human race. Language is not a thing but a competence that every average human being possesses. It is a unique competence that gives the speaker a competence to create a novel sentence when he needs one to express his thoughts.
Man discovered this linguistic competence many millennia ago. The discovery of language is one of the three most important revolutions in the history of mankind. The first was the discovery of symbols, that is, the use of something for something else. It paved the way for the discovery of language because language is nothing but a set of arbitrary symbols. Thirdly, man discovered another set of symbols to stand for the sounds used in language, so that he could take language beyond time and space. Language gave the man a tool that no other living being possesses, making him unique in the animal world. It is the most crucial line that divides man and animal. Language made man the founder of human civilization and culture.
However, we are born without a language. We all cry, scream and yell but we cannot speak. Though we cannot speak, we have the physical and mental capacity to learn to speak. As the infant is fed by its mother, day in and day out, the infant begins to imitate the sounds produced by its mother. The mother and the infant begin to communicate with each other in language. This language is thus called the mother tongue in English. In Sinhala, the mother tongue is called mavubasa or ma:trubha:sha:.
The mother tongue that every human being learns first is also called his first language. All other languages that a man acquires later are collectively called second languages. The mother language becomes ones most powerful and efficient medium of communication. Sometimes ones mother tongue is referred to as the language of his or her heart (hadabasa).
Language as a symbol of ethnic identity
Secondly, the mother language becomes an important symbol of ethnic identity. Neither blood nor physiological features help in the identification of ethnicity.
I call myself a Sinhalese, not because of my blood or my facial features, but because Sinhala happened to be my mother tongue. If my mother was Tamil by ethnicity, I would have learnt Tamil as my mother tongue and I would think of myself as a Tamil.
The mother language, being the most crucial symbol of ethnic identity, gives members of that community a sense of pride and self-respect. As a result, any attempt to harm, belittle or disparage the mother language is considered an act of treachery and disrespect. The mother language thus becomes not only the most powerful medium of communication but also a symbol of ethnic identity.
Modern history tells us of multilingual nations that ran into conflict, disharmony and war because of their language policy. Sri Lanka and Pakistan are two classic examples of this unfortunate episode.
National Development
Sri Lanka is now in the process of building a new nation where all ethnic groups, the Sinhalese, the Tamils, the Muslims and the Burghers, can live in peace, harmony and integrity.
In order to achieve national development, steps have been taken by many institutions to build national unity through mutual understanding among speakers of different languages.
Accordingly, a Presidential initiative for a Trilingual Sri Lanka has been launched with a view to spread the competence of the two national languages, Sinhala and Tamil, and the link language, English, among the communities at large.
The task of implementing this programme is in the hands of several Ministries, departments and commissions. Among the ministries, the most important is the Ministry of National Co-existence, Dialogue and Official Languages.
The compilation of textbooks, trilingual dictionaries and glossaries of technical words is in the hands of the Department of Official Languages. Complaints regarding the implementation of the Official Language Policy are handled by the Official Language Commission.

Learning a bitter truth in defeat
	

The results of the recent local poll had left the former madam in a state of shock, they say.

What had greatly shocked and dismayed her was the partys defeat in her very ancestral area, long considered a pocket borough of the family.
The madams shock had given way to fury when she discovered that most hangers-on and domestic aides had disappeared as the election results were trickling in.
Addressing a few faithfuls who had remained behind, she had said: My successor had crowds mobbing him wherever he went even after his defeat. Our fellows are a contrast! In victory they hang around like leeches and run away like frightened dogs in defeat!
After giving vent to her anger, she got things ready to leave for her second home abroad,
they say.

Motorcycle Group leaves Questionable trail
	
Controversy over Maharagama Urban Council
Following campaigns led by candidates starkly divided on various issues, Sri Lanka on February 11 woke up to the news of a surprise win for the newly formed Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) backed by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. What was supposed to be an uneventful and peaceful election resulted in turmoil with uncertainty ruling the local political landscape.
While many were concerned over the future of the Unity Government, a peculiar incident reported from Maharagama meanwhile piqued the interests of voters and candidates alike. Ahead of the February elections, the SLPP nominations to the Maharagama Urban Council were rejected in early December. As a result SLPP announced its support for the independent group (Group 2) contesting with a motorcycle as its symbol. Following these developments the Elections Commission explained that no candidate could resign from contesting until the elections were held. The Commission stated that though some political parties announced their backing for independent groups, members of the elected independent group could not be replaced by members of any other political party.
The candidate elected from the Rukmale Division, Bombuwala Devage Josephine is in fact eighty years old! One of these candidates is a resident of Ampara, but has now become a council member. This exploitation by SLPP has been approved by the public as well
However on February 11, reports emerged that candidates from the victorious independent group in Maharagama were not residents of the councils jurisdiction. According to these reports --with the exception of a few -- most candidates on the motorcycle groups list, were not residents of Maharagama. The addresses listed next to their names read as Divulapitiya, Badalgama and Wellawatta.
Many politicians challenged the appointments and questioned their faith in the new electoral system. Critics included the Janatha Vimukthi Permanuna and the Social Democratic Party which vehemently criticized the incident. The Daily Mirror spoke to the General Secretary of the Social Democratic Party, Thusitha Balasooriya, who took to social media criticising the candidates elected to the Maharagama Urban Council.
The SLPP claimed victory owing to the new electoral system. The objective of introducing the mixed electoral system was to give every village a representative in a Local Government Authority. This concept has been exploited by the SLPP. The partys continual request to the public was to vote for the Pohottuwa or flower bud symbol urging them to heed no attention to the candidate they would vote for. The result of this was the election of six candidates of the same family, namely: Bombuwala Devage Samanmala Janaki, Bombuwala Devage Josephine, Devage Lakmini Madushani, Devage Vimalawathi, Bombuwala Devage Sujatha Dharmapriya and Bombuwala Devage Sarath Dharmapriya, Balasooriya said.
The candidate elected from the Rukmale Division, Bombuwala Devage Josephine is in fact eighty years old! One of these candidates is a resident of Ampara, but has now become a council member. This exploitation by SLPP has been approved by the public as well, he said questioning the rationale of electingsuch candidates.
We have discovered that the Independent Group No 2 which contested for the Maharagama Urban Council was paid a sum of Rs. 5,000,000. Prior to receiving this sum an affidavit has been obtained from the independent group as well. A separate agreement had been signed stating that the elected candidates of the independent group would tender resignation making way for those in the rejected nominations list of the SLPP. Such corrupt acts would not only distort public opinion, but also lead to a significant waste of public monies. Unfortunately this is not just the picture of Maharagama, but the situation observed wherever the SLPP has claimed victory, Balasooriya alleged.
There may be a repetition of what took place in the Colombo Municipal Council several years ago, where the UNP nominations list for the Colombo Municipal Council was rejected, an independent group contesting under the spectacle symbol secured 23 seats with the support
of the UNP
The Daily Mirror approached the Executive Director of the Campaign for Free and Fair Elections (CaFFE) Rajith Keerthi Tennakoon to query his stance on the developmentsin Maharagama.
When the SLPP got its nomination list for Maharagama rejected they announced that it would be backing an independent group for the UC, which was their alternative. This is completely legal. Now we are faced with a situation where the resignation of elected candidates can make way for other candidates to replace them. There are legal provisions to do that. However to make way for this, we need an environment where every single elected member has to resign. There is no exception for said process, Tennakoon opined.
The SLPP had an agreement that they would support this independent group. They arrived at this decision at the very last moment, even after the postal votes were cast. What we are witnessing is actually a victory in spite of this group not receiving their postal votes.
Meanwhile the Eksath Lanka Maha Saba Party contesting under the snake symbol in Thirappane, defeated the UNP, SLFP and JVP with 32.96% votes. Another Independent Group contesting under the Rhino symbol won a majority of 39.87% of votes in Mahiyangana. According to Tennakoon however this is no cause for surprise. It must be noted that this is nothing new and it was reported from several areas including Mahiyanagana and Tirappaney.
Tennakoon believes the problem does not lie in the manner in which the Maharagama candidates earned their votes. The majority of these contestants never came to Maharagama, they never even knew that they are candidates for this particular election. But they won a considerable number of votes. After they were elected we looked for these people. We learned that the party leader had some understanding with MP Dinesh Gunawardena and some other Joint Opposition members. This agreement too is within the law, Tennakoon reiterated.
The problem now is that there are some candidates who do not want to resign. These candidates have been consulting opinions of experts about the next course of action. They are constitutionally elected members and it is up to them to decide whether or not to assume duties as council members. For those seeking to become members of the Maharagama Urban Council when the elected candidate resigns, it will not be an easy task.
On the other hand there may be a repetition of what took place in the Colombo Municipal Council several years ago, Tennakoon said.
He referred to the May 2006 elections, where the UNP nominations list for the Colombo Municipal Council was rejected, an independent group contesting under the spectacle symbol secured 23 seats with the support of the UNP. A Trishaw Driver performed better that anyone else during these elections and eventually became the mayor. We were very watchful of the developments during this tussle. There were several allegations regarding some officers in the CMC. To our surprise no corruption charges were levelled against this gentleman.
This group comprises residents of Divulapitiya. They have been registered as voters in this district, but have not registered in Maharagama. We have not been able to verify these reports. According to our preliminary findings, these individuals seem to be unaware of the fact that they have been candidates of this election
With such experiences in mind, it is my opinion that this sort of environment will come into play in Maharagama as well.
The people of Maharagama are fortunate if it transpires in a positive way,Tennakoon opined.
We must keep in mind that these candidates were voted into power despite the presence of the candidates fielded by the opposition, including very senior politicians. The candidates who won in Maharagama may not be the most qualified and are mostly ordinary people. I have observed that some of these candidates are very capable of serving the community and they will not resign. Through this process, a better balance will be created, he added.
Speaking on the electoral system the CaFFE Executive Director said the situation in Maharagama is not a failure of the system or the candidate. It is a failure of the voter. The situation will not be completely negative and would not be ridden by corrupt politics as expected. The process that is in formation will be a time consuming process, and will not happen overnight.
The Daily Mirror also spoke to Executive Director of Peoples Action for Free and Fair Election (PAFFREL) Rohana Hettiarachchi to obtain his views on the matter. According to the law, when nominations are submitted, they require certain qualifications to be registered as a candidate for elections of the respective area of authority. Qualifications to be registered as a candidate at Local Authorities Elections are detailed in a separate section explaining the registration of electors, Hettiarachchi said. 
Accordingly a person, who was on the first day of June in the year of the commencement of the preparation of the register, ordinarily resident in any area within the electoral district, is entitled to have his name entered in the electoral list. According to the Elections Commission, ordinarily resident means, the said person could be a resident of this particular electoral area, even though the initial residence is not the same. For instance if a candidates temporary residence is in Colombo, whereas his initial residence is elsewhere, he can be considered as an ordinary resident of that area where he dwells most of the time. Therefore such registration is not mandatory for contesting, Hettiarachchi said.
The problem in this instance as reported to PAFFREL, is that this group comprises residents of Divulapitiya. They have been registered as voters in this district, but have not registered in Maharagama. We have not been able to verify these reports. According to our preliminary findings, these individuals seem to be unaware of the fact that they have been candidates of this election. So the issue lies in the fact that voters of Maharagama were misled. I view this incident as an instance where the voter has been deceived,he stressed. 
Hettiarachchi said when the Election Bill was tabled concerns were voiced regarding this matter. We were of the opinion that a candidate should be a resident of the respective area, which is the only way to ensure real representation to Local Government bodies. However the present legal provisions have been established otherwise. The basic values of the electoral system is diminished from such occurrences, he said.
Even though similar incidents were reported from several other areas, only Maharagama has been highlighted. We have received information that a group of garment workers have been included in a list of nominations in Polonnaruwa. Deception has been carried out not only through independent groups. Some candidates have misled voters stating that government officers would be elected to office. Others had canvassed for votes fielding one candidate in the list, but presenting another in the eye of the voter. These were carried out to gain the popular vote. Yet another case was reported where a group of individuals who were not residents of the area had contested at elections.
If they are challenged in court, they would have to prove that they are qualified to register in that area. Looking at the overall picture we have observed that voters have been deceived and misled, Hettiarachchi detailed. Asked if there were legal provisions for such incidents to occur, he said as long as such incidents are not challenged in court, the Elections Commission would only reject the nominations based on the following factors: 
1. If the complete deposit is not made
2. If the womens quota has not been fulfilled
3. If the secretary has not signed the nominations list
4. If the secretarys signature has not been certified
5. If the representative does not submit the nominations list
6. If the nominations list is not submitted before the deadline
Hettiarachchi added the Elections Commission is not equipped to evaluate the qualifications of each candidate within such a short period of time. If candidates are corrupt, or have been charged in court, if they are residents of the area, these factors should be challenged in court by concerned parties. Political parties attempt to represent the people during elections. The basic premise is that they will not commit a fraud or deceive the voter. 
If any person finds that these candidates are not residents of the councils jurisdiction, their appointments can be challenged in court. Individuals who do not meet the qualifications under the aforementioned Local Government Elections Ordinance, cannot become a council member
Provisions in law to challenge erroneous appointments -Premathilake
The Daily Mirror also spoke to the Legal Officer of the Ministry of Provincial Councils & Local Government, Gayani Premathilake to confirm if legal action can be initiated against candidates who have not fulfilled the necessary qualifications. The Local Authority Election Ordinance specifies that every person who is not disqualified by section 9, shall be qualified at any time for election as a member of any local authority if the person is, on the first day of June in the year of the commencement of the preparation or revision of that register, ordinarily resident in that electoral area. To qualify as ordinarily resident the GS has to certify that a person resides in this area,she confirmed.
Premathilake stated that there are provisions in the law to challenge any appointment found to be erroneous. If any person finds that these candidates are not residents of the councils jurisdiction, their appointments can be challenged in court. Individuals who do not meet the qualifications under the aforementioned Local Government Elections Ordinance, cannot become a council
member, she said.
Several attempts to contact the Elections Commission failed. However according to available data, the Daily Mirror has observed that the anomalies reported in the Local Government Election were not limited to Maharagama alone. The confusion of voters and doubts over qualifications of the candidates as being ordinarily resident of their respective areas were reported from many parts of the island.

No decision to increase gas prices yet: Minister Bathiudeen
	
Government has not been decided to increase the price of domestic gas in the upcoming days until the pricing formula is finalised, Industry and Commerce Minister Rishard Bathiudeen said.
Addressing the media at the ministry yesterday he said several requests had been made to the Ministry by the two main gas companies (Litro and Laugfs) for immediate price increase.
The Ministry cannot approve any sudden price increase for domestic gas. The gas had become an essential consumer item and therefore the government had decided not to increase the prices despite the fluctuation of the world market price, the Minister said. During the earlier cabinet meeting it had been decided to formulate a common price formula for gas.
The individuals who want to increase gas prices should submit their proposals to the cabinet. Minister Bathiudeen said. The rumors are spreading in websites about the gas price hike by Rs.300 per domestic cylinder and no truth in it, he added. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)

No one can change womens quota - CaFFE
	
No one had the power to alter the 25% female representation in the Local Councils, Campaign for Free and Fair Elections (CaFFE) Executive Director Keerthi Tennakoon said today.
He also said that the number of members did not increase due to the 25% quota for women.
Addressing a news conference, he said the crisis transpired on account of the ineffective decision to change the First Past the Post (FPP) and the Proportional Representation (PR) systems from 70% - 30% to 60% -40% after the delimitation.
When the Local Authorities Elections (Amendment) Bill was presented to Parliament, the two percentages were mentioned as 70 percent under the First Past the Post system and 30 percent under the Proportional Representation system.
But it was inconsiderately altered as 60 percent under the First Past the Post system and 40 percent under the Proportional Representation System. This short-sighted decision led to increase the members of the councils and create an issue in the 25% of women quota, Tennakoon said.
Some members try to secure their seats by claiming that the 25% quota for women is the barrier. We insist that nobody can challenge any election laws and if anybody tried to do so, it is of no use, he added. (Sheain Fernandopulle)

Poised for the next somersault
	

This one is a politico deeply involved in a popular game in our country.

He is among those who made it to Diyawanna through the Blue partys charity list. The party boss considering his experience in the media field and his being free from obligations to an electorate put him in charge of the partys propaganda machinery well ahead of the local polls.
Later the politico made several visits to the North and other distant places by helicopter and got the body controlling the popular game to foot the airfare bill.
As the polls drew closer, the politico realized that coming colours no good and said adieu to the propaganda job and left the country saying that he was going to attend an important international conference.
However, the informed ones maintain that the man received no invitation to the conference in question and none knows what he had been doing during his long visit abroad either.
Now back in the country, the politico is said to be looking for ways and means of warming his way into the graces of the former strongman, they say.

Preserving linguistic diversity and traditions
	

Mother language or mother tongue is the language used and spoken by the mother, father and other members of the family of an infant.

Mother speaks with baby while feeding, soothing...
	More appropriate to call it the family language
	Powerful instruments of heritage
	He pulled down the Union Jack and trampled on it
This language is inherited by the infant by virtue of his or her birth in that family. Thus Sinhalese is the mother language of a baby born to a Sinhalese speaking family and Tamil is the mother language of an infant born to a Tamil speaking family.
Likewise, Japanese, Chinese, French, German, Spanish, Korean, Russian and various other languages are the mother languages of those who are born to respective families using and speaking such languages.
Mother speaking to the baby while feeding, soothing, lulling, pacifying, bathing, washing and dressing and whenever she wants to show and express her love to her infant son or daughter he or she starts to like and love the mother and listens attentively to the words of the mother and learns the language word by word especially when she sings songs in a bid to put him or her in bed.
Very often the infant first learns the words such as Amma, Umma or Mami (Mommy), indicating the mother and words such as Papa, Appa, Ayya indicating the father.
On the Mother Language Day, we should remember that our Mother Languages should be given the due recognition in view of the need to preserve it.
Afterwards, they utter words indicating the other members of the family including the brothers, sisters, and grandparents. Later they learn words and numbers and thus they learn the language of the mother and hence it is called the mother language or the mother tongue. Presumably, it is more appropriate to call it the family language because the infants learn it from all the members of the family and not solely from the mother.
Promoting and developing fuller awareness of linguistic and cultural traditions
Languages are the most powerful instruments of preserving and developing tangible and intangible heritage. All moves to promote the disseminate mother tongue will serve not only to encourage linguistic diversity and multilingual education but also to develop fuller awareness of linguistic and cultural traditions throughout the world and to inspire solidarity based on understanding tolerance and dialogue.
All groups of people are desirous of preserving and developing their tangible and intangible heritage. All moves to promote the dissemination of mother tongues will serve not only to encourage linguistic diversity and multilingual education but to develop fuller awareness of linguistic and cultural traditions throughout the world and to inspire solidarity based on understanding, tolerance and dialogue.
Relations among mother language and religious heritage
Generally, those who use and speak common mother languages build their own culture. There is a binding effect. There may be members belonging to different religious groups but they tolerate one another because of the binding effect and solidarity built among them.
Language should be at the junction of many sensitive and diverse problematic areas. The use or non-use of a language in the public spheres such as schools, the media or the internet is thus linked to levels of individuality, national alliance or power.
People deprived of their legitimate rights
In the past, the people in countries which came under foreign domination were deprived of their legitimate right of using their mother languages. This has adversely affected the national heritage of the respective nations or countries.
The traditions, qualities and culture of those countries which existed for long periods of time and which are extremely important to those countries could not be passed on to future generations affecting the masses socially, culturallyand economically
Mother languages under the threat of extinction
There are about three thousand languages in the world but only a limited number of them are used internationally. Many of these languages are under the threat of extinction. Agitations are made constantly by various sources for the recognition of mother languages as State languages. As a result, February 21 has been proclaimed as the International Mother Language Day by the UNESCO in November 1999.
International recognition of the language movement
In a bid to promote linguistic and cultural diversity and multilingualism the International Mother Language Day is observed annually by the UNESCO member states and at the UNESCO Headquarters.
This is mostly the international recognition of the language movement day, which had been commemorated in Bangladesh (Former East Pakistan) since 1952 when a number of Bengali speaking people were killed by the then Pakistan Police and the Army in Dhaka (Formerly Decca)
Students campaign for the recognition of Bengali as one of the State languages
On February 21, 1952, a number of students campaigning for the recognition of Bengali as one of the State languages of Pakistan were killed when Police fired on them.
A Masters Student of the University of Dhaka, Abdul Barket, a student of the Manikgonj District, Rafiquddin Ahmad and an employee of the accounts section in the Dhaka High Court Shafiur were the Language Martyrs, who were killed on February 1952.
Following that Bangladesh officially sent a proposal to UNESCO requesting the world body to adopt a resolution declaring February 21 as the International Mother Language Day.
This proposal was seconded by Ivory Coast, Italy, Indonesia, Iran, Oman, Comoros, Gambia, Chile, Dominion Republic, Pakistan, Papua, New Guinea, Prague, Philippines, Bahamas, Vantaa, India, Micronesia, Malaysia, Egypt, Russia, Lithuania, Sri Lanka, Saudi Arabia, Slovakia, Surinam and Honduras.
Mother Language in Sri Lanka in the past
During the reign of Sinhala kings, Sri Lankans enjoyed the privilege of using the mother language.
Foreign languages had not been introduced to our ancestors. Only Sinhala and Tamil languages which are our mother languages had been used in communication by our forefathers.
However, under the Western rule from 1505 onwards, the people of this country were ruled by three powers, Portuguese, Dutch and the British, who spoke and used languages other than our own and which are alien to us.
Communication between the rulers and the subjects did not work well.
There were very limited opportunities for higher education in Sinhala and Tamil. After the Senior School Certificate Examination (Jesta Pathashala Sahathika Patra Vibhagaya), a limited few could advance their education in mother languages, which were referred to as vernacular languages. Until 1956 University education was provided only in the English medium.
Examinations for the recruitment of candidates for positions in the Public Service were conducted only in the English medium, holders in the positions in the Ceylon Civil Service (Later the Ceylon Administrative Service and SLAS), Accountants Service, Engineering Service, and the Government clerical and allied services were conducted only in the English medium.
However, foreign domination could not prevent patriots from maintaining the eminence of our mother languages while preserving our culture.
Buddhist clergy played the pivotal role. Venerable Wariyapola Sri Sumangala Thera is an example.
He pulled down the Union Jack and trampled on it in protest against the Colonialism. The objective of these protests and agitations was to save the country, religion and the language from foreign domination.
Weera Keppetipola, Weera Puran Appu, Gongalegoda Bandara were some of the leaders who fought for the liberation from foreign rule and to save the country, religion and the mother languages.
Special mention should be made about the monk, S. Mahinda Thera who instigated and urged on the Sinhala community to fight for the language and nationalism.
Sinhala and Tamil languages remained rich, especially with religious literature. Grammar or the rules of using mother languages were laid down in books such as Sidat Sangarawa. In spite of step-motherly treatment, the methods of using these languages in the correct form were taught by scholars like Munidasa Kumaratunga. In spite of implementing the Official Language Act, the discussions in the Parliament were continued to be conducted mainly in English as it is the language common to most of the members.
Some Parliamentarians were not happy with it. One such Parliamentarian was T.B. Tennakoon, who was elected to Parliament in 1956 and was appointed as the Deputy Minister of Cultural Affairs. Mr Tennakoon could speak and understand English but he preferred to speak in the mother language. Under the Sirimavo Bandaranaike Government, he became aCabinet Minister.
On the Mother Language Day, we should remember that our Mother Languages should be given the due recognition in view of the need to preserve it.

Students stage lie-in protest
	

Students are in the middle of a lie-in protest outside the White House over gun laws just days after 17 people were killed in the Florida high school shooting massacre. 
Groups of students from Washington DC staged the protest on Monday on a road leading to the White House. 
They took turns lying on the road for three minutes - the same amount of time 19-year-old Nikolas Cruz went on a firing spree at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School last week. Other students stood by holding signs that read Am I next and Is Congress or the NRA making
our laws  Protesters started the protest at about 12.30pm on Presidents Day. 
A Facebook post on the groups page said the lie-in was meant to be a representation of the victims of school shootings. 
By doing this, we will make a statement on the atrocities which have been committed due to the lack of gun control, and send a powerful message to our government that they must take action now, the group wrote. 
We will be the last mass shooting, said Gonzalez, a senior at the high school who took cover on the floor of the auditorium as a shooter rampaged through the building. 
She directly addressed President Donald Trump, reading out his tweet in response to the shooting and demanding to know how much the NRA had donated to his campaign.

Swiss AG demands harsh penalties for LTTE masterminds
	
In the indictment plea in the Tamil Tigers trial, in Bellinzona, which lasted for almost two days, Swiss Attorney General Juliette Noto has requested that the 12 Tamils be found guilty of participating or supporting the LTTE.
The newspaper Neue zrcher zeitung said the federal prosecutors are clear that the accused Tamils have financed terrorism and supported a criminal organization with the Tamil Tigers.
For most of the 13 defendants, the federal prosecutor attested grave offenses and a high level of criminal energy.
The 12 Tamils have contributed to maintaining an efficient and complex system in Switzerland over the years with the sole purpose of illegally raising funds and then channelling them through tortuous routes to the LTTE.
In the main, the federal prosecutor requests that the 12 Tamils be found guilty of participating or supporting a criminal organization.
The only exception is the former bank employee. Most of them also have to answer for fraud and forgery, some also for money laundering and extortion.
In particular, for the mastermind of Tamil Tigers in Switzerland, the prosecutor demanded high fines.
For the head of the World Tamil Coordinating Committee (WTCC), which was considered an offshoot of the Tamil Tigers in Switzerland, she demanded an unconditional imprisonment of 5 years and a fine of 180 daily rates of 80 francs.
The Chief Financial Officer of the WTCC is to receive an unconditional imprisonment of 6.5 years and a fine of 180 daily rates of 100 francs.
For the other defendants, the federal prosecutor demanded prison sentences of between 18 months and five years as well as fines.
In essence, the prosecution considers it has been proven that the Tamil Tigers were a criminal organization that attacked civilians and recruited child soldiers.
The defendants had financed their monetary payments therefore terrorism.

Thai Engineers to bring artificial rain
	
A team of Thai Engineers yesterday carried out a feasibility study in the catchments areas of Castlereigh and Maussakele reservoirs to cause artificial rains in view of the prevailing drought. They had arrived on the request of the Ceylon Electricity Board.
The only organisation patented to cause artificial rains in drought affected regions is in Thailand. Engineers of the organisation said that they with the help of the Thai Government had caused artificial rains in several countries affected by droughts. A CEB Engineer said the Thai Engineers had caused artificial rains in Castlereigh and Maussakele areas during a drought in 1981.

UN warns of humanitarian disaster in southeast Congo
	

REUTERS, 20th FEBRUARY, 2018- An upsurge of violence in southeastern Democratic Republic of Congo is set to cause a humanitarian disaster of extraordinary proportions, the U.N. refugee agency UNHCR said on Tuesday.
Congos Tanganyika province has seen a sharp escalation of violence since late last year, with new armed groups forming and an increase in attacks and the use of firearms, UNHCR spokesman Andrej Mahecic told a regular U.N. briefing in Geneva.
We are warning today that a humanitarian disaster of extraordinary proportions is about to hit the southeastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, as the province of Tanganyika plunges further into violence, triggering spiraling displacement and human rights abuses, he said.
Clashes between militias representing the Luba, a Bantu ethnic group, and Twa pygmies, have already been going on for more than four years, driven by inequalities between Bantu villagers and the Twa, a hunting and gathering people historically excluded from access to land and basic services.

UN withdraws torture concerns, Australia to deport LTTE suspect
	
A Sri Lankan asylum seeker, who is an LTTE suspect, is to be deported from Australia after the UN Committee against torture had withdrawn a request to halt his removal, the Guardian reported on Wednesday.
Shantaruban, currently held in immigration detention in Melbourne, has been in Australia since arriving by boat in 2012. A notice of intention to remove from Australia has been issued against him for February 22.
Shantarubans claim for refugee status has been rejected. He says he has been unable to properly present his claim for protection because he was initially fearful to declare his association with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).
When Shantaruban later sought to present evidence of his involvement with the LTTE, it was ruled inadmissible because he had not declared it earlier.
Other former members of the LTTE have declared their association and have had their claims to persecution recognised by the Australian government.
In October last year, the UN committee against torture issued an interim measure request, formally asking that Australia refrain from returning Shantaruban to Sri Lanka while his complaint is under consideration.
The UN, several governments and human rights groups have consistently raised serious concerns over the return of Tamil asylum seekers to Sri Lanka, particularly those with known links to the LTTE.
However, Australias permanent mission to the UN in Geneva wrote to the committee this month arguing Shantarubans claims are not substantiated and that it is not necessary to take the interim measures requested.
It said, there were no substantial grounds for believing Shantaruban faces a real risk of irreparable harm if returned to Sri Lanka.
In response, the committee on February 19 wrote to the Australian government, lifting the interim measure and effectively clearing the way for Shantarubans removal from Australia.

The employees of a state corporation with a large workforce had decided to celebrate the Pohottuwa poll win.

As a prelude to the celebrations, a group of employees had begun replacing all pictures and portraits of a former purohita which were on display on walls and other places in the building complex with those of the former strongman.
Even a group of pro-yahapalanaya employees had extended their co-operation to remove the portraits of the former purohita saying that the latter brought discredit to the government.
Later all employees irrespective of their party sympathies had shared several large cakes brought to celebrate the occasion.
The highest in the yahapalanaya echelons had come to know about the celebration held at the state corporation soon afterwards. After listening to what had happened at the corporation, he had laughed loud making no comment, they say.

25% women reps not possible in 10 LG bodies
	
Elections Commission Mahinda Desapriya said the 25 per cent woman representation could not be maintained in at least ten local government bodies because of a lacuna in the Local Authorities Elections Act.
Though the Act stipulates that each of the councils should be made up of 25 per cent woman representatives, the parties that contested the polls in these ten local bodies appear to have found it difficult to nominate women candidates.
The Act states, Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this Ordinance, not less than twenty five per centum of the total number of members in each local authority shall be women members,
The Act provides for the election of 60 per cent of the representatives for electoral wards and the remaining 40 per cent on the proportional representation system and that of the total number of members to be elected to a local authority, 25 per cent should be woman.
In the event of a party having only male candidates elected in terms of the electoral wards, it should reserve some slots for woman representatives from the list to be nominated under the PR system.
However, there are instances where the parties and independent groups were not entitled to any representation under the PR system. This has happened in the local government areas where a particular party concerned has won all the electoral wards. Also, the parties, with than three members elected, are not required to nominate women from the list.
Mr. Deshapriya said 25 per cent women representation could not be ensured at all for ten local authorities in the North and East.
We will gazette the list of candidates assigned to each party this week. We will try to ensure woman representation as much as possible. Otherwise, there is nothing we can do, he said. (Kelum Bandara)

Youth is energy  untapped
	
Dr. Mallika Kumar is Associate Professor for Economics at the Shri Ram College of Commerce (SRCC) of the University of Delhi. She is the Head of the Commerce Department and the Coordinator for the Office of International Programmes at SRCC &the Cultural Coordinator for the University of Delhi. She is also a member of the UNDP Microfinance Solution Exchange. She has done her PhD on Financial Cooperatives and works on promoting cooperatives among the youth across the globe. Dr.Kumar coordinates with the Youth Committee of the International Cooperative Alliance which is the apex organisation for cooperatives worldwide, representing 306 cooperative federations and organisations across 105 countries.
Recently, she was invited by the Kelaniya University to deliver a lecture on Cooperative Business Model-Perspectives from India as part of a collaboration between SRCC and the Kelaniya University to connect the youth of India and Sri Lanka.The High Commission of India facilitated the collaboration between these two universities. In an interview with the Daily Mirror she spoke about the role of the youth in developing the economy, unemployment, skills mismatch, poverty, microfinance and debt repayment. She said that Government revenue being spent on debt repayment is a worrying situation.
Associate Professor for Economics at the Shri Ram College of Commerce (SRCC) of the University of Delhi Dr. Mallika Kumar speaks about India-Sri Lanka in relation to their youth
	Reversing brain drain should be the key priority for developing economieslike India and Sri Lanka
	It is a sheer waste and limits economic growth to that extent
	Sri Lanka and India can lend a helping hand to learn from each other
	Microfinance has led to heavy debt burden in some regions and some cases
Excerpts:
Q India is a developing country like Sri Lanka. What role does the youth play in developing the economy
Todays generation of youth (ages 15-24 years) at almost 1.2 billion, is the largest in history. It is estimated that 89% of the worlds youth live in developing countries and in many of those countries the youth constitute over half of the population. 
Developing countries like Sri Lanka and India have a large youth population. Being the most dynamic and energetic segment of the population, the youth contributes most to the workforce of the economy of a country. In India, 50% of the population is below age 25 & 65% of the population is below age 35.This is a demographic dividend for the country. If they are educated,skilled, trained and employed well according to their abilities, they add to the productivity and significantly contribute to the GDP and the economy of the country. 
I am glad to hear about the appointment of the new Youth Envoy, Jayathma Wickramanayake of Sri Lanka as the youngest member of the Team by the UN Secretary General on the UN International Youth Day, August 12th, 2017. Whether it is India, Sri Lanka or any other developing country,youth is energy untapped.They possess not only new ideas, but also the energy and the power to turn ideas into action that may empower themselves as well as others. Empowered youth can play an important role not just economically as agents of change, but also from a social perspective in preventing conflict and building peace for sustainable development of the economies. 

Developing countries like Sri Lanka and India have a large youth population. Being the most dynamic and energetic segment of the population, the youth contributes most to the workforce of the economy of a country
Q There are around 43 000 unemployed under graduates in Sri Lanka. Why do you think that they are unable to find suitable employment
The focus on education is very high in Sri Lanka. The Ministry of Education says, Education First. But, despite the high literacy rate and high quality of life, compared to other developing countries, unemployed under graduates may be high. This is because they are not properly skilled or given vocational training. There may be a mismatch in their capabilities and the expectations of employers.
Q How can we overcome skills mismatch
Skills mismatch between education and skills demand and supply can be overcome through reimagining the education system and making it more relevant and adaptable to the current trends and also identifying the skills required by different sectors of the economy and accordingly focusing on skills development. There can also be skills based training programmes for the unemployed. The youth should be skilled to undertake jobs in the future and not only the ones available at present. 
There is a need to identify each youths orientation and interest and then provide him or her with the requisite set of skills to ensure that contributions are made willingly and happily to the nations economic well-being. 
In India, the National Skills Development Corporation(NSDC) operates through partnerships with multiple stakeholders in catalyzing and evolving the skilling ecosystem.
There is also support to early-stage social entrepreneurs working on innovative business models to address gaps in the skilling ecosystem, including programmes for persons with disability. 
I believe in the 3Cs- Connect, Collaborate and Cooperate. Opportunities can be explored whereby youth of both nations can collaborate with each other and share their ideas to be not just job seekers, but also job givers/creators. 
My research was based on cooperatives and the purpose now is to help the youth connect to bridge gaps and learn from each other.The International Cooperative Alliance Youth Committee helps the youth connect with each other from different parts of the world.Thus a good career counseling, on-the-job training, a revamped education system and a global connect with focus on skill development can help overcome skills mismatch.
Q How does the issue of under graduates being unemployed affect the economic growth of a country
This is a very relevant question in todays world where pace of labour force growth outstrips job creation. Employment has both economic, social and political aspects to it. Economically, if the youth are unemployed it will affect their livelihoods. They will not be able to participate in any economic activity. Socially, it can lead to other evils. Further, they would not be able to represent the youth in the political and economic debates. Unemployment affects the economic growth of a country as it results in waste of valuable human resources. Under graduates are ready to contribute, but find no opportunity to do anything as per their abilities. It is a sheer waste and limits economic growth to that extent. 
I believe in the 3Cs- Connect, Collaborate and Cooperate. Opportunities can be explored whereby youth of both nations can collaborate with each other and share their ideas to be not just job seekers, but also job givers/creators
Q Brain drain is said to affect the economy adversely. How can itbe prevented
Brain drain takes the best of brains away from the home country. To prevent it, the home country must invest heavily on education, vocational training, skills development, Research and Development, Innovation,Technology and create opportunities for youth. It can also be prevented by changing the culture and mindset of people to give back to the society he or she was raised in and by bringing the large companies to the country and allowing for a better pay scale. 
Creating better-paid opportunities at home and ensuring sustainability of employment would thus prevent brain drain. Reversing brain drain should be the key priority for developing economies like India and Sri Lanka.
Q What are the sustainable options available to India and Sri Lanka to combat poverty
Both Sri Lanka and India face similar types of challenges, problems and have similar strengths too. Going by the SWOT Analysis (a study done to find its Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats) in both India and Sri Lanka, our strength is our human capital. But this strength can also become a weakness if we fail to utilize that potential. As you rightly mentioned there is the challenge of unemployment and the challenge of the youth getting disoriented when their potential is not utilized. 
The sustainable options available to India and Sri Lanka to combat poverty start with providing food, shelter and other basic necessities through welfare schemes and secondly by providing skill sets to these people so that they can be gainfully employed in some economic activities in their surroundings. 
A very good opportunity for both the countries is that since the Governments are open to new ideas they can get the best use of technology. Technology can be utilized to make good use of these ideas and translate them into reality. In this years Republic Day speech Ambassador Taranjit Singh Sandhu said that India and Sri Lanka have familial ties. Family is not just by blood, it is also created by those who lend a helping hand to each other. So Sri Lanka and India can lend a helping hand to learn from each other.What is required is to strengthen the educational ties. We from the University can help students, so that the youth of both nations can share their ideas and implement them. 
Brain drain takes the best of brains away from the home country. To prevent it, the home country must invest heavily on education, vocational training, skills development, Research and Development, Innovation,Technology and create opportunities for youth
Q How has microfinance upliftedthe economy of India-especially rural India
In India, the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) finances banks that on-lend funds to Self-Help Groups.(SHGs). The NABARD SHG-Bank Linkages Programmes, is the largest Microfinance Programme in the world which has touched 10 crores households through more than 85 lakh SHGs. It is the most widely participated programme in the country and perhaps in the world. The large number of Channel partners, which at present is more than 100 Scheduled Banks, 349 District Cooperative Central Bank (DCCBs), 27 State Rural Livelihood Missions and over 5000 NGOs, are engaged in promoting Self Help Groups. 
Rural Financial Cooperative credit institutions have played a very important role in providing microfinance to uplift the rural economy of India.There are around 100,000 Primary Agricultural Cooperatives covering almost all villages and they reach wide covering remote areas as well. Cooperatives and SHGs have facilitated microfinance to make credit available to the needy in time and at their doorsteps. There are a number of examples of Microfinance by Cooperatives in India. Bhagini Nivedita Coop in Pune and Cuttack Urba Coop Bank in Odisha are examples. They are doing microfinance with lower interest rates compared to other banks and serve as a tool for financial as well as social inclusion. 
The customized schemes and options have been created by microfinance companies to suit the needs of the rural artisans, traders ,entrepreneurs and especially women. 
The only disadvantage of mobile banking is that it is usable by the literate and educated lot alone. Less educated countrymen are unable to utilize its advantages to the best
Q What are the advantages and disadvantages of using mobile banking in microfinance in developing countries
Mobile banking, being a subset of branchless banking, increases the access of banking facilities by adding the Anytime Anywhere feature. One of its main advantages is that it addresses the cost of roll out (outreach) and the cost of handling low value transactions by using agents instead of banks. Through the Business correspondent model, microfinance provided facilities in the remotest corner of the rural countryside. This has kick started economic activities in every nook and corner of the country. 
The only disadvantage of mobile banking is that it is usable by the literate and educated lot alone. Less educated countrymen are unable to utilize its advantages to the best. Phones that use internet browsers, but do not have antivirus may be at a risk of getting hacked for sensitive information. 
Government revenue being spent on debt repayment is a worrying situation. Debt servicing is a committed liability of a Government
Q In Sri Lanka microfinance loans have made many families debt ridden especially in the Northern and Eastern provinces. Last year a 28-year-old mother, reportedly in debt, committed suicide giving poisoned ice cream to her three very young children. How do you prevent mounting debts and such fateful incidents caused by microfinance schemes
This happens normally in multiple lending or lending beyond the capacity of the household. Given that the cost of debt in microfinance being very high, in adverse situations like drought, flood, natural calamities and some unforeseen circumstances, microfinance has led to heavy debt burden in some regions and some cases. 
Giving more time for repayments and rebates can help. Close monitoring by Government is required to avoid multiple MFIs. 
In Andhra Pradesh, India a similar situation prevailed when the supply of microfinance was more than the demand and there was no control of Government in terms of regulating interest. Then Reserve Bank of India (RBI) regulated the outer limit of interest. 
Q Sri Lanka is currently trapped in debt and reportedly about 95% of Government revenue is spent on debt repayment. What are the feasible solutions available
This indicates debts raised have not been productively used in the past. It is important to focus on the what, why and how i.e.for what purpose the money is borrowed, why it is being borrowed and the most important is how it will be utilized. 
All wasteful expenditure must be cut. Unproductive, uneconomical and loss making activities need to be pruned.A credible fiscal consolidation plan which commits to shoring up revenue and rationalize expenditure is needed to keep fiscal deficit in check. 
Government revenue being spent on debt repayment is a worrying situation. Debt servicing is a committed liability of a Government. Therefore, nothing much can be done to reduce the liabilities except by way of bilateral rescheduling of repayment to mitigate the short-term debt stress. 
On the receipt side, the Government needs to broaden the tax base, ensure tax compliance, tap more sources of non-tax revenue, etc. On the expenditure side, there can be austerity measures to keep in check the wasteful recurrent expenditure, unwarranted subsidies, size of Government, etc. 
We are aware that the Fiscal Management (Responsibility) Act has been in place since 2003 to strengthen fiscal discipline of the Government of Sri Lanka. The Fiscal Management Act aims at achieving fiscal sustainability. In addition, the New Inland Revenue Act seeks to improve tax administration. 
I am hopeful that adherence to the contours of Fiscal Management (Responsibility) over time will go a long way in bringing about fiscal consolidation in Sri Lanka. We have the example of India to quote in this context. Adherence to the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act of 2003 and medium term fiscal frameworks of the Government over time have already started yielding the desired outcomes. These outcomes may be seen in significant reduction in debt-GDP ratio, fiscal deficit, revenue receipts particularly tax revenue, rationalization and prioritization of current expenditure, etc.
I am hopeful that adherence to the contours of Fiscal Management (Responsibility) over time will go a long way in bringing about fiscal consolidation in Sri Lanka.
Q Recently the Auditor General said that the countrys foreign and domestic loan was Rs. 8.9 trillion by the end of 2016, but the audited domestic assets was Rs. 1.1 trillion. What implications does such a discrepancy have on the countrys economy and debt management
This discrepancy indicates that debts raised have been utilized for consumption or non productive or revenue expenditure, which has led to lack of capital formation, infrastructure and industrial growth 
In June 2016, Sri Lanka entered into a three-year arrangement under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) of USD 1.5 billion with IMF. By July 2017, USD 501.5 had already been disbursed. Countrys debt may have suddenly gone up on account of the disbursal of loan under EFF. 
Under the medium-term fiscal strategy, the Government remains committed to its fiscal strategy of containing budget deficit to a sustainable level by maintaining fiscal discipline, revenue-based fiscal consolidation and rationalizing Government expenditure to improve productivity. 
Debt-Assets Ratio is over 800% in this case. For a private commercial entity, this would reflect extremely serious insolvency. However, I think that this financial health indicator for a public entity, that too, for a Government of a developing economy can be seen in a different perspective.The assets will continue to be acquired while liabilities gradually done away with steadily rising current revenues for a Government of a developing country like Sri Lanka. This would bridge the current gap between debt and assets in the long-term together with fiscal prudence and fiscal consolidation over time.
