The post of Sri Lanka’s ambassador in Germany has fallen vacant.

 


Berlin, now the capital of unified Germany is considered one of the key stations in the country’s Foreign Service and normally only a senior official with an exemplary track record in the Service is appointed as the head of our diplomatic mission in this capital.


However, a very junior female official has already been picked to fill the Berlin vacancy bypassing the most senior official on the list, they say. The power behind the lady picked for appointment as the country’s ambassador in Berlin over the heads of many seniors, is said to be a political authority handling foreign affairs. By the way she is the former wife of a state purohita in yahapalanaya, they say.
