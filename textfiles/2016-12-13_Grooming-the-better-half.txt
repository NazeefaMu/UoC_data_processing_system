Grooming the better half


	

A former provincial councilor from the Kandy district has begun setting up electorate level party organizations on his own as part of a larger plan to groom his wife as a candidate at the upcoming PC polls.

 


This politico had forfeited his right to contest polls for a specified period on being found guilty to an election-related offence by a court of law. Undeterred, this worthy is now trying his best to secure the election of his wife as a PC member on the party ticket. He is organizing political meetings at regular intervals for the main purpose of introducing his wife to the voters.  He makes it a point to get his followers to accord a warm reception to his wife – profusely garlanding her and raising cheers – at these meetings.
