Former Sri Lanka cricket team skipper Sanath Jayasuriya today denied the report that he had allegedly smuggled rotten betel nuts (areca nuts) to India.

He said he had never been involved in any business activity dealing with betel nut.

“This is absolutely false and I have never been involved in any business activity dealing with betel nut. I completely deny the contents of the article and my lawyers have already responded to this defamatory and false article,” Sanath Jayasuriya tweeted.
