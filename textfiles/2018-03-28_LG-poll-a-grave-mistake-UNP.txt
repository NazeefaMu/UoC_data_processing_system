The recently held Local Government poll was a crime of national proportion and a grave mistake committed by the two main parties to the nation, Home Affairs Minister Vajira Abeywardana said today.

The comment was made in relation to the numerous political clashes taking place in the country, as parties struggle to retain power in several local government bodies.

“Not only the LG poll is a crime, it is also a crime that no one is coming forward to voice against this. The main two parties of the government; the UNP and the SLFP, should take responsibility for the repercussions of this electoral system. This grave mistake we committed should be rectified,” he told a news briefing held at Sirikotha.

He said the maintenance expenses of the LG polls doubled with the new electoral system as the number of councillors increased exorbitantly. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
