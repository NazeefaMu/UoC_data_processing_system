Colombo Additional Magistrate Dharshika Wimalasiri today recalled the arrest warrant issued against former Minister Mervyn Silva's son Malaka.

The suspect surrendered to the court today and tendered a medical report over his absence during the last court proceedings.

Malaka, accused of allegedly assaulting a Scottish couple at a nightclub in Colombo 2014, was not present at the court when the case was taken up previously prompting the magistrate to issue an arrest warrant.

The further Magisterial inquiry was postponed to March 6. (Shehan Chamika Silva)
