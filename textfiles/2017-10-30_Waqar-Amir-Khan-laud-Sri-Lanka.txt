Former Pakistan head coach Waqar Younis has lauded Sri Lankan team's visit to Lahore to play the T20 international as a good sign for the return of international cricket to Pakistan, the Nation reported today.

Waqar said he was very happy to see that the Sri Lankan team was in Lahore and played a Twenty20 at the Gaddafi Stadium.

“Their visit is very important for our cricket and hopefully it will now lead to more teams to come to Pakistan,” he said.

Waqar said the PCB deserves credit for bringing back international cricket to Pakistan and also for convincing Sri Lanka to play one off Twenty20 in Lahore.

"What happened in 2009 was very bad for Pakistan cricket. It hurt our cricket and young players a lot. But now things seem to be moving in the right direction and today our people can show everyone that they are a peace-loving nation, who enjoy cricket.”

The former captain said that the Sri Lankan government, Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) and players had shown that they were true friends of Pakistan.

"I know it must have not been easy for them after what happened eight years back with them. I can understand if some of their players have pulled out. But the important thing is Sri Lanka is here," he added.

Pakistan-born British boxer Amir Khan also came to Lahore to witness the third T20 match.

Talking to media outside the Gaddafi Stadium, Amir hailed Sri Lankan team for visiting Lahore and termed it a great decision taken by them which shows that Pakistan is a safe country and Pakistanis love cricket and want to see international cricketers playing in front of them.

“I came here especially to support Pakistan team and I am glad to be here. I hope after Sri Lanka , more international teams will visit Pakistan and the country will start hosting full-fledged cricket soon,” he added.
