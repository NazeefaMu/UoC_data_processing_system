A secret missive from the palace sparks off speculation


	



 

A rumour doing the rounds in political circles says that a senior member of the yahapalanaya top team had visited a temple in Narahenpita for the specific purpose of delivering a secret missive from the ‘palace’.

 


The missive from the ‘palace’ was intended to convey a message to the former strongman. 


The top team member hand-picked for this errand is a politico hailing from a gem-rich area who had been steadfast in the view that the two warring factions of the Blue party should unite letting bygones be bygones. 


According to this rumour, the missive had carried a reference to the rebel group being a stumbling block to the smooth running of yahapalanaya apart from a clear hint about a possible shake-up at the top that could lead to a solution acceptable to all. Meanwhile, some analysts cite the results of the recently held elections to co-operatives that gave a jolt to the yahapalanaya leadership is the immediate cause for sending the missive.
