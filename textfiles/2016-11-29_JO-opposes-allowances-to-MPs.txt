JO opposes allowances to MPs


	

The joint opposition said today they were completely against the monthly allowance of Rs.100,000 to be paid to MPs so that they could help their constituents.

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe is reported to have said in Parliament on Monday that the monthly allowance was being paid to enable MPs to give wedding gifts and make donations for funerals.

MP Bandula Gunawardane said this move was against the principles of Yahapalanaya.

“One of the main slogans of the government during the election was against the mega Cabinet of the Rajapaksa government and its excessive spending. The people elected this government expecting a change, but instead of any changes, this government is now paying extra allowances having ignored all its hyped up election propaganda. Is this how it is keeping its promises” the MP asked at a news conference. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
