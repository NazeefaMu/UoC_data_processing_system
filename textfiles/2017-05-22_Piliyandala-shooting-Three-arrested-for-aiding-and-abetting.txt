Three persons including a woman were arrested by the Mirihana Special Crime Investigation Unit in connection with the shooting which killed a 11-year-old girl, a police officer and injured several others earlier this month.

Police said the trio was arrested last night in Ahangama on charges of aiding and abetting a suspect wanted for the shooting. The three suspects had misplaced crucial evidence of the shooting and had also given false information to investigators, police said.

The suspects, between the ages of 22 and 44, were identified as residents of Ahangama and will be produced at the Kesbewa Magistrate Court today.

Police Constable Chaminda Abeywickreme was killed while Police Inspector M. Neomal Rangajeewa and Constable Chaminda of the Police Narcotic Bureau were injured when two gunmen opened fire at them during a raid in Piliyandala on May 9.

Four civilians, including three children were also injured in the shootout. One of the injured, a 11-year-old girl, succumbed to her injuries while undergoing treatment at the National Hospital in Colombo last Friday (19).(Darshana Sanjeewa)
