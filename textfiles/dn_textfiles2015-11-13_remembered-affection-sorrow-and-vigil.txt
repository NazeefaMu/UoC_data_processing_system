World Day of Remembrance for Road Traffic Victims 2015
Remembered with affection, sorrow and vigil

The Day of Remembrance for Road Traffic Victims, first held in 1993 in the United Kingdom and organized since then by non-governmental organizations in a number of countries, was created as a means to give recognition to victims of road traffic crashes and the plight of their loved ones who must cope with the emotional and practical consequences of these events.
On October 26, the United Nations adopted a Resolution which calls for governments to mark the third Sunday in November each year as World Day of Remembrance for Road Traffic Victims. Observation of this day provides an opportunity to draw the public's attention to road traffic crashes, their consequences and costs, and the measures which can be taken to prevent them. The day also provides an opportunity to remind governments and society of their responsibility to make roads safer.
Road crashes as we know are never any pleasurable memories, especially to the victims and their families. The victims or their deprived families do not need to remind themselves the gruesome memories that they have undergone. By hosting this day we hope to honour the deceased and to acknowledge the society. In this manner we believe that the awareness on road accidents will increase in our country.
Sri Lanka joined as this global event in 2014 with the spearheading of National Council for Road Safety along with the active participation of Sri Lanka Police, RDA, WHO and other responsible institutions.
Imagine the chaos that erupts in a family once the sole breadwinner perishes or is permanently crippled for the rest of their life. No compensation can yield them light from the grave they have fallen. No one can bring happiness back to their family hearth. Their drawbacks and adversities will be beyond renovation. With a moment's mistake, many will be tormented for ages. Therefore as responsible citizens and far more being humans, we must think again before we start speeding or losing our attention on the road, for it is not only our lives that we put into stake, it is others as well.

Nearly 3400 people perish per day due to road accidents and it totals up as 1.3 million per year. Also, nearly 30 to 40 million injuries record up due to road accidents, 500 children perish per day due to road accidents.
Existing system of accident management
Speaking about the Sri Lankan context, nearly six to seven people perish per day, but as of the records of 2014 and 2015, it has risen to seven to eight per day. Also nearly 2500 people perish per year while tens of thousands are injured due to road accidents in Sri Lanka.
When the facts and figures are subjected to a thorough study, one can observe that the accident fatalities in Sri Lanka fluctuate at random. For an instance deaths due to road accidents have reduced over 2012 and 2013, however, 2014 shows an increase once again.
This is a clear indication that the existing system of accident management can be improved for betterment. In the global context, developed countries possess a Sustainable Scientific Methodology for the minimizing of road accidents. By the introduction of such a system, Sri Lanka too can achieve a conspicuous result for their dedication.
Out of the fatalities in the global context, nearly 92 percent of deaths are claimed by the middle income and low income countries while only the rest 8 percent is accounted by developed countries. However what's notable is that 47 percent of vehicle registrations are claimed by the developed countries despite their very low fatality rate.
A notable example I would like to cite is Sweden, in 1997 Sweden marked 541 as the death toll per year, but in 2010 it was reduced to 270, Japan, another large consumer of motor vehicles topped 16, 705 fatalities in 1970, however by 2011 it was cut down drastically to 4611. What is notable is that the vehicle consumerism of these two countries increased even though the accident rate decreased.
Here I would like to cite an example from Vietnam, Vietnam has a GDP of 2,052.3 USD which falls acutely below the 3,631.0 USD (based on 2015 World Bank Report) of Sri Lanka, However Vietnam succeeded in curbing the road accidents because they were able to initiate an integrated scientific methodology in 2008 which received the participation of all responsible institutions of that country. Thereby their deaths per ten thousand people shows a consistent reduction which shows that their low cost, high efficient system is conspicuously successful.
'Safety is our responsibility'
As road users, we all have a responsibility; I believe that 'Safety is our responsibility'. Thereby every time an accident happens all the parties involved have a degree of responsibility, however it must be well understood that the singular participation of a party cannot address this issue properly, however with the widespread participation of all responsible stakeholders involving personalities and institutions can make this seemingly impossible task, a possibility.
Developing countries like ours vaguely identify that road crashes pose a great threat to the well-being of the society. This has been the historical error we've been doing for ages. We must open our eyes at this inevitable fact and contribute to abolish this threat, because "Together Everyone Achieves More".
For an instance, apartheid and slavery were man-made errors, but we abolished them successfully and today we stand on a world platform common to all. Smallpox was eradicated from a stage where it was an epidemic which frightened the hearts of many. But today we have changed the once fearful eras into peace. This is because the entire mankind united to change it, not alone but together, as one.
Also it should be noted that the society has a massive role to play when it comes to road safety. The civil society must be courteous enough to obey the road rules and support the government and the institutions to carry out this manoeuvre.
Since 2011 to 2020 was named as the "Decade of Action for Road Safety", we must all, as individuals and institutions, join hands and work towards one goal. I believe this is possible once a solid Action Plan is drafted and carried out. Also beyond all, I believe that this dream demands one critical requirement. All the individual institutions who work for road safety must get together and create an Integrated Network where all of them will cooperate and coordinate in their endeavours. If this is enacted, I believe that we can achieve the Safe Road we all dream. If Vietnam did it, why can't we. The Resplendent Land, do it?
