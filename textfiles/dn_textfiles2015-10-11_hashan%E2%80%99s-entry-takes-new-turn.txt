Hashan’s entry takes new turn

Sri Lanka's search for a new cricket coach took a new turn when former Sri Lanka captain Hashan Tillakaratne sent his application to become the batting coach of national team which has been been in wilderness without a proper professional coach. A veteran of 83 Tests and 200 One Day Internationals, 48-year-old Tillakaratne seems to be an ideal choice to resurrect the batting department of the Sri Lanka national team, if he gets the blessings of the Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) Interim Committee.
Sri Lanka team's batting was in a total mess during the recent home series against India and Pakistan as the home team lost the back to back series with the identical margin 1-2, one of their worst defeats on home soil since gaining the Test status way back in 1982.
The recent retirements of veteran Test batsmen and former captains, Mahela Jayawardene and Kumar Sangakkara as well as that of Tillakaratne Dilshan from Tests have broken the backbone of Sri Lanka batting. Following the conclusion of Jayawardene's 149-match Test career during the last home series against Pakistan, Sangakkara retired from Tests after the first two Tests in the last home series against India. Now that both Jayawardene and Sangakkara, who had done bulk of the scoring in recent times, have retired it would be a heavy burden on skipper Angelo Mathews in marshalling his brigade during the team-building process.
Tillakaratne's patience at the middle as a dependable Test batsman has been a shining example, scoring 4,545 runs with an attractive average of 42.87 in 83 matches with 11 centuries and 20 fifties. At a time Sri Lanka is struggling to groom a good set of top and middle order batsman, an experienced campaigner such as Tillakaratne could play a vital role.
But it all depends on how transparent the SLC Interim Committee would be when picking the ‘right people for the right job'! Petty club politics should be a thing of the past, giving the highest priority to build a strong national team to fill the vacuum. It would not be an easy task to find a middle order pair which could emulate Mahela and Sanga and their absence would be badly felt. Yet, Sri Lanka must make every effort to find batsmen who could somewhere get closer to their exemplary careers.
Going by the recent performance records, Sri Lanka may once again opt for a professional foreign coach. Yet, past Sri Lanka cricketers with proven track records could be used to development specialized areas such as batting, fast bowling, spin bowling and fielding. It was unfortunate that Sri Lanka has not continued with its fast bowling coach Chaminda Vaas who had captured 355 Test wickets and 400 ODI wickets with his ‘left-arm fast bowling'.
Vaas’ instant results
During the rare break he got to coach seamers of New Zealand team, Vaas produced instant results that prompted local cricket authorities to sign him. But the manner in which he was unceremoniously dumped with various excuses should not be approved and Tillakaratne too should not be treated in similar fashion.
The services of the most outstanding former Sri Lanka cricketers such as Vaas and Tillkaratne should be used in the most profitable manner to sharpen the skills of the national team. This could be done under the overall supervision of a foreign head coach. Had Marvan Atapattu teamed up well with Vaas, Sri Lanka would never have lost successive home series which eventually compelled the former Sri Lanka opening batsman to step down from his position as the head coach.
The West Indies have just begun their full tour of Sri Lanka although the hosts are still in search of a permanent coach. SLC's head of coaching Jerome Jayaratne, who does not have any intentional experience as a player, is now functioning as the interim head coach appointed by the interim committee. His interim appointment came merely four days after Atapattu had tendered his resignation as the national team coach after Pakistanis and Indians had beaten us on home soil.
Although Jayaratne was appointed the head of coaching in 2008, his role was not extended to the national team which was then coached by Trevor Bayliss. Despite Atapattu becoming the first local to become the head coach of the national team after many years, he did not last long.
Stylish opening bat turned coach Atapattu had officially held the position since September last year, but had effectively been head coach since April 2014, after Paul Farbrace's departure. Atapattu had worked as batting coach of the team since 2011 and it is this post which has been kept open that Hashan had applied for.
The SLC's hunt for a head coach gained momentum last year with over 12 high-profile persons, including Mickey Arthur, Ray Jennings and Eric Simons from South Africa and Chris Adams of England showing their desire to coach Sri Lanka national team. But the SLC finally settled for Atapattu, a decision which had been criticized by certain quarters.The premature exits of Farbrace and his successor Atapattu have forced Sri Lanka cricket administrators to do “coach shopping” once again.
Whilst accepting that Sri Lanka has “fallen behind” in Test cricket, the interim head coach Jayaratne has said the team is working hard to correct that during the upcoming home series against West Indies. Sri Lanka have lost their last three Test series, against New Zealand away and then to Pakistan and India at home, winning two and losing six out of eight games and Jayaratne will face a gigantic task in putting the house back in order. Although Jayaratne expects an improved performance against West Indies, it would not be an easy task for Angelo's lads to come on top.
Windies’ own worries
Batting and ground fielding are two areas that cost Sri Lanka its last two series against Pakistan and India. In the absence of a batting coach, a role that was fulfilled by Atapattu, Jayaratne has taken on the task for the time being. Jayaratne has said he is also keen on keeping the team atmosphere good, and has instructed the players to come to him if they are not comfortable.
The West Indies too have their own worries to address. West Indies captain Jason Holder has said that the fate of suspended head coach Phil Simmons lay in the hands of West Indian board but added that he had been a “wonderful inspiration” during his brief time in charge.
Simmons’ position was put in limbo when he expressed discontent over West Indies’ ODI squad for the tour of Sri Lanka. However, Holder hopes for a swift resolution that would allow Simmons to return to the squad in Sri Lanka. Though Simmons has apologized for his controversial remarks, he was asked to answer for “breaches of confidentiality” by the WICB and is currently awaiting an HR hearing.
The untimely suspension of Simmons has posed a significant problem for West Indies, coming as it did only days before the squad was scheduled to assemble in Sri Lanka. Simmons was appointed West Indies coach in March and the Sri Lanka tour would have been his first international foray with the outfit. Interestingly, the two-Test series against Sri Lanka will be Holder's first assignment as captain. Undoubtedly, Simmons’ suspension is a setback for the West Indies.
Skipper Holder would make every effort to create history on debut to add salt to Sri Lanka's wounds after hat-trick of Test series defeats at the hands of New Zealand, Pakistan and India. But the West Indies have never won a Test series in Sri Lanka.
