Prediction gives him hope!


	



 

This purohita who once held high office in the Green Party went on pilgrimage to India and Nepal recently. During his pilgrimage to the Himalayan State where the Buddha was born, he called on a well-known ‘Nadi-vakya’ soothsayer to get a reading of his political future and the outcome of several pending court cases against him.

 


And the soothsayer made a prediction that was music to his ears: That with the ending of the Erashtaka malefic period by March next year, he will not only get a seat in the august assembly; he will be also raised to purohita status. The politico had asked the soothsayer how he could look forward to purohita status given that he is no longer a member of the assembly and the general poll is about four year away. 


The soothsayer had replied: “I can’t explain to you how you will become a member of the assembly. But I can assure you that they will confer on you such high office that you have never dreamt of. And it is going to be a certainty as the sun-rise in the morning!” The soothsayer had also requested the politico not to forget to inform him of his good fortune, when his prediction comes true!


Despite the prediction being too good to be true, the politico is said to be taking heart from the fact that the credentials of the soothsayer have never been challenged in the country where he practices!
