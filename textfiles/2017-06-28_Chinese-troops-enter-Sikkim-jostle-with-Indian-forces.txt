Chinese troops entered India in the Sikkim sector and jostled with Indian army personnel guarding the Sino-India frontier, destroying two bunkers.   


The face-off has been going on in Doka La general area in Sikkim for the past ten days and the Chinese troops have also stopped the batch of pilgrims that was proceeding for Kailash Mansovar yatra, official sources said on Monday.   


The Indian troops had to struggle hard to stop the Chinese personnel from advancing further into Indian territory. They formed a human wall along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) to stop the PLA personnel, some of whom also videographed and clicked pictures of the incident.   


The Hindustan Times reported it was not the first time that such a transgression has happened at the Doka La, a place at the Sikkim-Bhutan-Tibet 
tri-junction.
