	Japanese Judge Motoo Noguchi who called on former President Mahinda Rajapaksa at his residence this morning has agreed that the best course of action was to have judicial mechanisms manned by Sri Lanka’s own nationals, a statement issued by the former president’s media office said.
	When Mr. Rajapaksa has said that the appointment of foreign experts as judges exercising judicial power in respect of the Sri Lankan armed forces and other Sri Lankan citizens was at no time contemplated by his government, Mr. Noguchi has agreed that the best solution was to have a domestic judicial mechanism.
	“The appointment of foreign experts as judges is politically unacceptable to our people and also because it involved conflict with basic provisions of the constitution of Sri Lanka,” Mr. President has said.
	He has described in some detail the challenges which confronted his government and the strategies which he put in place to overcome them.
	Meanwhile, Mr. Rajapaksa clarified that the intention of his government, in response to a written request by Chairman Maxwell Paranagama was to secure for the benefit of the Sri Lankan commission the expertise of several international experts including Mr. Noguchi.
	Mr. Noguchi appreciated the invitation extended by the former government to serve in an advisory capacity to assist the Commission on Missing Persons and described his experience in the war crimes tribunal of Cambodia and the manner in which it was functioning.
	Mr. Rajapaksa pointed out the fundamental difference between the Sri Lankan and Cambodian contexts, and referred to the salient features of the Sri Lankan situation, the basic element of which was the eradication of terrorism and the availability of the opportunity today for all citizens of Sri Lanka irrespective ethnic identity, to live in an atmosphere of peace and tranquility.
	Former External Affairs Minister G.L Peiris was also present at the meeting.
