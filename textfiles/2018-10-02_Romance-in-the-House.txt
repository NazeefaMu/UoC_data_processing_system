A budding romance between a dashing Romeo and a fair and lovely one, both Diyawanna members hailing from Sabaragamuwa lends a poetic quality to the grim and sombre atmosphere in the august assembly on some days, they say.




This couple cooing and giggling in a corner dead to the ongoing proceedings has become a familiar sight to their Diyawanna colleagues.


The lover-couple representing the same political party often becomes the butt of jokes and witty remarks from their colleagues, but they continue to live in the world of their own, they say.
