A Court of Appeal Bench comprising Justices Rohini Walgama and S.Thurairaja today fixed for August 2 the inquiry into the contempt of court charges filed against GMOA President Anuruddha Padeniya.

The charge sheet was read to him in court and asked to show cause as to why he should not be punished for the alleged offence. He pleaded not guilty to the charges.

Gamini Marapana PC with Navin Marapana appeared for Dr. Padeniya while Upul Jayasuriya with Chandimal Rajapakse and Lakna Seniviratne instructed by Chitrananda Liyanage appeared for the petitioners.

The contempt of court complaint was filed by the National Movement for Social Justice (NMS) Convener Professor Sarath Wijesuriya and Puravesi Balaya Co-convener Gamini Viyangoda.

They said the Court of Appeal delivered a judgment on January 31, 2017 directing the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) to grant provisionally registration to an MBBS graduates who had passed out of SAITM and issued a writ of prohibition preventing it from refusing to register SAITM's MBBS graduates.

The petitioners said the GMOA had openly criticized the judgement and demanded that it be annulled or set it aside.

The petitioners are seeking the Court to punish Dr. Padeniya on the contempt of court charges. (S.S. Selvanayagam)
