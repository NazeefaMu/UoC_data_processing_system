SC orders AG to look at possibility of recruiting SAITM graduates


	

The Supreme Court yesterday directed the Attorney General to look into the possibility of recruiting medical graduates passed out from the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) in Malabe as government doctors.

The court made this order after considering a fundamental rights petition filed by three students of SAITM requesting court to grant them the opportunity to be recruited as government doctors.

They had pointed out in their petition that only the graduates passed out from state universities and foreign universities were eligible to be recruited as doctors according to the Medical Service Minute of Sri Lanka Health Service published in the gazette notification issued in October, 2014.

Since the graduates passed out from the degree awarding institutions have been excluded from being recruited as government doctors under the particular gazette notification, the petitioners had requested the court to annul the said minute and grant them the opportunity to be recruited as government doctors after being passed out from SAITM.

After considering the petition the court also instructed the Attorney General to look into the possibility of amending the said minute. (Thilini de Silva and Ranjan Katugampola)
