GSP plus: EU says SL has made commendable progress
	
Sri Lanka has made commendable progress towards abiding by the conventions needed to regain GSP+, but still more work needs to be done, the visiting delegation from the European Parliament said today.
The four-member delegation arrived in Sri Lanka on Monday to check out the ground situation as a precursor to a successful GSP+ application.
At a media briefing held at the EU Mission in Colombo, Chair of the delegation, Jean Lambert said, Good progress has been made, but there is work still to be done. The applications success is dependent on the tangible progress made by Sri Lanka. Therefore, we urge the government to seize the moment and make sure that they meet the criteria,
Meanwhile, Charge d'affaires Paul Godfrey said a country which had applied for GSP+ needed to show progress in areas of 27 conventions -- of which 19 conventions were related to human rights, six to labour and two to the environment.
The members of the delegation were not in a position to reveal how many conventions Sri Lanka had made progress in.
Commenting on the time frame of the procedure of making a decision on re-awarding the GSP+ facility, the EU Ambassador to Sri Lanka, Tung-Lai Margue said it could take 8-10 months from the time the application was submitted.
Since Sri Lanka applied in July, we are looking at a period of 10 months at the maximum, which ends in May, to make a decision. Therefore, the final answer is certain by May 12, he said.
He said the European Commission (EC) would have to go through the application submitted by Sri Lanka first and then it would be referred to the Council of the EU and, finally, placed before the European Parliament for a vote.
The delegation, including Sajjad Karim, Thomas Mann and Ulrike Mller, met the Prime Minister, the Foreign Minister, the Opposition Leader, the Chief Minister of the Northern Province and civil society organisations.
Commenting on the reconciliation process, Ms. Lambert said they had noticed a change taking place within the country, such as the setting up of the Office of Missing Persons (OMP) and the Constitutional reforms which are scheduled to be presented to Parliament by the end of November.
She also stressed the need to replace the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) in line with international standards.
The lands occupied by the military in the north should be returned to their rightful owners. If not, financial compensation should be given. We also discussed during our meetings the importance of power devolution, in terms of decision making and budgetary allocations, to provincial levels, Ms. Lambert said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

H'tota Port and Mattala Airport re-born: US$1 Bn for SL
	
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said yesterday said Sri Lanka was in the process of agreeing to a debt-equity swap with two Chinese companies to manage the loss-making Hambantota Port and the Mattala Airport.
He said the two entities would be converted to exclusive Investment Promotion Zones on the baisi of a Public Private Partnership (PPP) with the Chinese companies paying US$1 billion to Sri Lanka while absorbing their debt portfolio.
The Premier said the proposal would make the rupee stronger and increase the country's foreign reserves, he added. "City-centered development has been the norm in economic progress in major and emerging economic powers and Sri Lankas ambitious Megapolis and Western Development was based on the concept of making the entire Western Province a mega investment, trade and financial centre in South Asia."
In his keynote address at a ceremony to mark the World Cities Day under the theme Inclusive Cities  Shared Development organized by the Megapolis and Western Development Ministry at the Smart Tower at Battaramulla, the Premier said the US economy, the strongest in the world, has been developed round mega cities like New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and Houston.
"London's impact on converting Britain to a tiger economy in Europe was immense. In France, three or four cities have made a similar contribution making France an economic power in the world. The biggest emerging economic entity is China with its open market economic policies in place of communist ideology has taken Beijing, Shanghai and Canton as the midpoint of development with the inclusion of Mundong and Hong Kong to its economic resurgence, the Premier said. "The Megapolis Development Plan will make Sri Lanka the Naval, Trade, Banking and Financial Center in South Asia between Dubai and Singapore with industrial corridors in Jaffna, Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa, Trincomalee, Kandy, Galle, Hambantota, playing a major role as centre points of development with specialized industries and tourism playing the major role as specialized revenue earners in the respective regions."
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe recalled that when late President J.R.Jayewardene decided to launch the accelerated Mahaweli Development Project in 1978 under a separate Ministry and the Mahaweli Authority, a group of politicians and officials requested not to remove the project from the Agriculture and Irrigation Ministries as it would badly affect the Irrigation Ministry. But Mr. Jayewardene not only stood by his decision because he wanted a speedier development not in 30 years but in six years and tasked the job to the then Mahaweli Development Minister Gamini Dissanayake.
The results of that decision are well known. The massive contribution to the national economy from Mahaweli Development Project is a blessing. We launched the Megapolis and Western Development Project with the same objective. The job has been entrusted to Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka -- one of the most capable, efficient and qualified engineers," he said.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe launched the official Facebook of the Megapolis and Western Development Ministry on the invitation of Minister Ranawaka.
Primary Industries Minister Daya Gamage and Deputy Megapolis and Western Development Minister Lasantha Alagiyawanna were also present at the occasion. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

Budget airline Mihin Lanka will cease operations from today in line with the current Government's policy to amalgamate the airline with the national carrier Srilankan.

Former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga has said that the Sri Lanka Freedom Party's then deputy leader Maithripala Senanayake, his wife and Mahinda Rajapaksa were paid by J.R. Jayawardena to divide the SLFP.
At an event in Gampaha, she said she had ample proof to support her allegations.
I have the receipts to prove these transactions took place. Rajapaksa was paid Rs.35,000 on a monthly basis. Rajapaksa is trying to destroy the party today in a similar manner that he was paid to do years ago, Ms. Kumaratunga said.
She claimed that when President Jayawardenas move to destroy the SLFP by depriving former prime minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike of her civic rights failed in 1980, the then president had opted to bribe both Rajapaksa and Senanyake to divide the party.
The job for the payments made from 1980 until we came to power was to destroy the SLFP and chase Sirimavo away, Ms. Kumaratunga said.
Hinting that the party had been diluted during Rajapaksas tenure as leader, she said former leaders of the party were in no way associated with corruption.
We had generous leaders who gave up everything for the party and the people of this country. But the party was diluted within nine years by Rajapaksa, she said. (Tilakaratne Dissanayake)

Welcome that weighed heavily on the neck
	
A Minister who was the chief guest at a ceremony where houses were presented to a group of displaced families was welcomed with a hefty garland that had to be carried by four people.

The politician had later remarked that this was the biggest ever garland to have been put on him at a reception during his entire political career.
