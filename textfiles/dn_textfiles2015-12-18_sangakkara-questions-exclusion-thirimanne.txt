Sangakkara questions exclusion of Thirimanne

Former Sri Lanka captain Kumar Sangakkara questioned why a player like Lahiru Thirimanne, Sri Lanka's one-day vice captain, wasn't included in the team to tour New Zealand.
"Unfortunately there are guys like Thirimanne sitting on the sidelines," Sangakkara told reporters in Hobart.
"Sometimes one-day cricket and T20 cricket overshadow test cricket, but at the end of the day if you're a cricketing nation you want to have the best test-playing side out there in the middle."
Sri Lanka captain Angelo Mathews clearly respected what Sangakkara had to say. "Different people have different opinions," Mathews said. "Obviously, Sanga is one of the [biggest] legends that we've ever had.
"Sometimes as selectors, you know, as a team, you do [make] mistakes. You've got to rectify it and move forward. "It is what it is, what we've got is what we've got at the moment, we can't [make] any changes now. It's going to be a one off test where we have to give it our best shot, play our best team and try to win."
Sangakkara did have praise for Dimuth Karunaratne and Dinesh Chandimal for their efforts in the first test, and there were many more positive signs from the young Sri Lankan lineup in Dunedin. Mathews is hoping to build on that in Hamilton, and said the team will be out to get a result. "It doesn't really matter if we lose 2-0 by trying to win this game," Mathews said.
"We have a very good chance. It's just a matter of applying ourselves while batting and putting the runs on the board and then give our bowlers a chance to try and bowl them out."
