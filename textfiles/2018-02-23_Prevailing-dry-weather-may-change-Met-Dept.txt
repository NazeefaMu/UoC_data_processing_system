There is a possibility that there could be a change to the prevailing dry weather from tomorrow and accordingly several spells of showers may occur in the Uva Province and in the Ampara and Hambantota Districts, Department of Meteorology said yesterday.

It is predicted that showers or thunder showers may occur at a few places in the Galle, Matara and Ratnapura Districts after 2.00pm.

“Due to certain changes in the South-Eastern sea areas, the possibility for heavy showers or thunder showers and sudden roughness, associated with sudden increase of wind speed (up to 70-80 kmph) in the deep sea areas off the coast extending from Matara to Batticaloa via Hambantota and Potuvil is high,” Meteorology Dept. said.

Meanwhile, it said quite colder nights and mornings can be expected and the misty conditions can be experienced at some places particularly in the southern half of the island during the morning.

When considering the sea areas, it stated that showers or thunder showers would occur at several places in the sea areas off the coast extending from Galle to Batticaloa via Hambantota and added that fair weather would prevail in the other sea areas around the island.

Winds will be north-easterly direction in the sea areas and wind speed will be 25-35 kmph.

Sea areas off the coast extending from Mannar to Colombo via Puttalam and also from Hambantota to Potuvil will be fairly rough at times as wind speed increase up to 50 kmph at times.

It requested naval and fishing communities to be vigilant in this regard. (Sheain Fernandopulle)
