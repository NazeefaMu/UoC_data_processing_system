This political appointee heading a key establishment in the education sector has reportedly outsourced the janitorial services in three institutions coming under his purview to a firm he has a stake in. 

 


Only two workers are deployed in the cleaning services in each of these three institutions despite the names of seven workers appearing on their pay role, they say. The 15 persons drawing pay for no work are said to be employees of a business establishment in Mattakkuliya.
