GMOA to stop work from 8.00 a.m. tomorrow


	

The GMOA today announced it would launch a countrywide work stoppage from 8.00 a.m. tomorrow as planned over several issues including the suppression of university students’ rights and the attempt to abduct university students.

The GMOA said they decided to stop work because there had been no positive response from the authorities even though they had informed the President, Prime Minister and the Health Ministry regarding tomorrow’s strike action.



It said the strike action would not affect the maternity hospitals, cancer hospitals, children’s hospitals, emergency treatment units and dengue treatment units. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
