Wife laments politico’s decision to go independent


	

The decision taken by a certain Diyawanna member to function as an independent member severing all links with the government has highly upset his wife who is said to be in tears these days. 




This lady has made it a habit to criticize her husband’s move to quit the government with the constituents calling at their residence. She would tell them all in a plaintive voice: “Mage Mahattaya has got into a helpless position of his own seeking. Now nobody cares for us and we can’t get anything done…I can understand if we had to face this situation if that had arisen after a government change…”


The other day the Diyawanna member was speaking to a group of constituents, when his distraught wife who came there addressed him: “Why don’t you think of joining the government again?” 
The highly provoked politico retorted: “You mind your business. I’ll mind mine! Now go away!”
