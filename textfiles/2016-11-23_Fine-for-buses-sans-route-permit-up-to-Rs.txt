The Government had decided to the increase of the minimum fine charged by a Magistrate's Court from Rs. 10,000 to Rs. 200,000 for putting a bus in service without the valid passenger service route permit, Cabinet Co-Spokesman Gayantha Karunathilaka said today.

He said the laws were tightened against persons who deploy buses without valid permits for the security of the passengers from dangerous situations and to develop the quality of passenger bus service.

The proposal was made by the Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva to present the National Transport Commission (Amendment) Bill in Parliament drafted for providing provisions for the above purpose by amending Article 40 of the National Transport Commission Act No. 37 of 1991.
