	The Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) general secretary Udaya Gammanpila said today the SLFP’s decision to form a national government with the United National Front for Good Governance (UNFGG) was against the mandate because people voted for the UPFA in protest of UNFGG’s manifesto.
	Mr. Gammanpila said there was no mentioning of forming a national government in UPFA’s manifesto and that former president Mahinda Rajapaksa completely rejected the national government concept in his election rallies.
	“People voted for UPFA because they rejected UNP’s manifesto and forming a national government with them is against the mandate. We saw what happened to those who acted against the mandate at the general election. The same thing will happen to those who act against the mandate at the next election,” he said.
	Mr. Gammanpila told media when he arrived at the SIU to make a statement that they were committed to uphold the mandate and said they would not hesitate to come forward if something detrimental happen to the country.
	He said a false complaint had been lodged against him by Minister Champika Ranawaka and three others to sling mud at him before the election and police had realised the true nature of the complaint and that the police would not expect to continue the investigations into the complaint.
	Mr. Gammanpila said he would take legal action against those who lodged the false compliant to tarnish his image.(Ajith Siriwardana and Indika Sri Aravinda)WATCH
