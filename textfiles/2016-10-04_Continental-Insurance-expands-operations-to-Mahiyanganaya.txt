The branch network of Continental Insurance Lanka Limited (CILL) was further expanded to 45 with the opening of the Mahiyanganaya branch, conveniently located at No: 2/18, Padiyatalawa Road, Mahiyanganaya.
As the only insurance service provider in Sri Lanka to be accoladed with an A- Fitch rating within just five years of operations, CILL offers a range of insurance solutions poised to address diverse needs of both corporate and individual clients in the general insurance segment.
Sharing his views on the opening of the Mahiyanganaya branch, CILL Managing Director Chaminda de Silva commented that the driving force behind the strategic expansion of the company is to keep to the pledge of providing a redefined service, enabling customer convenience. 
He further stated that the cautious yet strategic expansion policy adopted by the company coupled with prudent underwriting practices has paved the way for a 32 percent year-on-year GWP growth for CILL, by the end of August 2016.
With its proven track record of stability, strength and professionalism, the newly opened branch office is fully geared to service the clientele in Mahiyanganaya in a wide range of general insurance services including motor, property, marine and general accident covers.
