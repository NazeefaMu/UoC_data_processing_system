The United National Party (UNP) is confident of winning the upcoming local government elections even if it contests under a symbol other than that of the elephant, Party’s Kurunegala District parliamentarian Nalin Bandara Jayamaha assured yesterday.

He dismissed the claims made by the opposition that the local government elections were being postponed because ruling party was afraid of losing and said the UNP would win even if it contested under the elephant's tail as a symbol.

Mr. Jayamaha said the local government elections were being delayed because the Government was keen to conduct the elections under the new electoral system which requires the demarcation of wards.

He lauded joint opposition MP Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena for having participated at the recently held workshop on oversight committees.

Mr. Jayamaha said former president Rajapaksa is engaged in attempts at pressuring President Maitripala Sirisena saying a new party would be formed by him as a means of escaping from the corruption allegations against him and his family.

Referring to the proposed Economic and Technological Cooperation Agreement with India he said it would be presented to Parliament before it was signed. (Yohan Perera)
