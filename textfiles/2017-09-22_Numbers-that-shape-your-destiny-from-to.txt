We are discussing the significance of numbers based on the numerical and vibrational value of a person’s name or date of birth or on the aggregate value of both. We have already discussed the significance of such numbers from 11 to 40 in previous articles. We are examining the significance of numbers from 41 to 50 in this article.

Number 41: This number signifies worldly success. The success is assured especially when the subject is working as `a team member’ of a large group. The subject is endowed with the ability to make sound judgments. Therefore, he would do well when he acts on his own judgment.

Number 42: This too is a favourable number. Persons holding high office help the subject achieve success. The members of the opposite sex would augment his fortune through love and affection.

Number 43: This number indicates hardships, obstacles, and upheavals in life. Efforts to meet the persistent challenges would end in failure.

Number 44: This number predicts losses due to speculation and in games of chance. The subject would suffer due to not being discerning and discriminating in choosing associates and business partners. There would be no happiness in marriage as the subject would fail to win the love and respect of the partner.

Number 45: This number signifies drive and action. The subject would achieve high office thanks to his skills.

Number 46: This number holds out much potential for positive action. However, success comes mainly due to help from friends and the members of the opposite sex.

Number 47: This number indicates loss of wealth due to unforeseen contingencies and unreliable employees and business partners. The subject would fall victim to wiles of the opposite sex.

Number 48: This number represents abstraction rather than pragmatism. The subject is one who builds castles in the air. He makes many plans, but they are never implemented. He is more a visionary than a practical person.

Number 49: The subject is apathetic and laggard in every activity. He is not a good mixer either. Therefore, he remains isolated from others. However, he would do well if he becomes energetic and proactive.

Number 50: This number represents success. The subject is endowed with good judgment and resolution. He would play a key role in a large organization. He would do well if he is guided by his own intuition and good sense.
