UNP MP Wasantha Senanayake has rejected reports that he had once again joined with the Mahinda Rajapaksa led government. 

Mr Senanayake told a media briefing at Temple Trees this evening that he had only attended a function which was organized by MP Atureliye Ratana Thera earlier in the day.

“I have not joined and will not join, but will remain with the UNP,” he told reporters. (Yohan Perera)
