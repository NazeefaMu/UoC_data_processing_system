US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo held cordial meetings with Pakistani officials in Islamabad Wednesday, hours after saying he hoped to “reset” Washington’s troubled relationship with its wayward ally.    The shift in tone between Pompeo and his counterpart Shah Mehmood Qureshi comes days after Washington confirmed plans to cancel $300 million in military aid.   But the former CIA director, making his first visit as top US diplomat to a nation whose support is vital in the Afghan conflict, told new Prime Minister Imran Khan he was “pleased” with his meeting with Qureshi.     “We had an excellent meeting. I’m very happy with the meeting we had,” Qureshi agreed, according to a pool report.
