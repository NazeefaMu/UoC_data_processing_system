Asgiriya Maha Vihara Chapter Registrar Ven. Medagama Dhammananda Thera making a special statement yesterday, regarding the insults made on Buddhist monks by certain politicians, expressed concern and condemned the act.

The Thera said: "At a time like this when President Maithripala Sirisena has taken a timely action to introduce an insurance cover for the old Buddhist monks , there are various government ministers and parliamentarians who have made insulting remarks by levelling allegations in various forms. It has to be treated as a downright insult.”

“There are politicians who have been rejected by the people and become popular in various fields. They act without any good feeling towards the country and without an understanding about the values, religious and cultural background and whims and fancies of the general public,”the Thera said.

The Thera said political party leaders should select candidates wisely and intelligently at the forthcoming elections without giving permission to candidates who are involved in unbecoming acts. (J.A.L. Jayasinghe)
