President Maithripala Sirisena must re-consider the appointment of K. Kader Masthan as the Deputy Minister of Resettlement, Rehabilitation, Northern Development and Hindu Affairs, UNP MP and Lanka Jathika Estate Workers' Union General Secretary Vadivel Suresh said today.

He said the President should take into account the fact that Mr. Masthan was a Muslim.

“It would have been better if a Hindu MP was appointed to be in charge of Hindu Affairs. Any one appointed to be in charge of religious affairs should be from the religion concerned and not from another religion,” the MP said.

He said that the President, Prime Minister and Speaker should ensure that the names of the 118 MPs who had obtained money from Perpetual Treasuries Ltd. be revealed soon.

“Revealing these names would allow innocent MPs to acquit themselves, while the people's right to know who the culprits are, would also be fulfilled,” the MP said. (Yohan Perera)
