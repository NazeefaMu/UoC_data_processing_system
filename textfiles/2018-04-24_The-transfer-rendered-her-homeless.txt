A story that has gone viral in political circles says that a certain governing one was compelled to vacate her official residence unexpectedly in the night before the day she was due to proceed to another province on transfer.

 


A close a kinsman of the governing one is said to have been behind the predicament caused to the latter. 


The governing one had got a jolt when her successor along with his family regiment had suddenly turned up at her official residence in the night and pressed her to move out immediately for they had come prepared to move in. 


An exasperated governing one had quit the residence saying, “Okay, I am leaving to spend the rest of the night in the street if need be, but am not removing any of my personal effects.”


The governing one later had to suffer insult added to injury when she found the outgoing colleague at the new station was still staying pat in the official residence.  So, the poor one is said to be occupying the official residence of the chief purohita of the province until her official residence is vacated, they say.
