An announcement made by a Betel leaf bigwig that they suspended the membership of a certain Diyawanna member from Puttalam district made a page one news story in national dailies in the country.

 


However, an official communication suspending the membership of the member concerned has not been issued so far, they say.


The announcement about suspending the membership of the member came following the latter’s declaration at a TV political talk-show that he did not personally recognize the new Big Boss as the chairperson of the Blue party. 


Some political sources say that there is a secret behind not issuing an official communication in writing suspending the errant Diyawanna member’s party membership and this secret will come out as a surprise soon.
