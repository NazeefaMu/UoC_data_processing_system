Ranjan complains to BC against Div. Sec.


	

Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake has complained to the Bribery Commission (BC) against the Divulapitiya Divisional Secretary with whom he was at loggerheads recently.

He told Daily Mirror he had lodged the complaint on Friday. In his complaint he alleged that 61 000 cubes of sand had been removed through sand mining despite the Geological Surveys and Mines Bureau (GSMB) having given permission to remove only 500 cubes of sand.

“The Bribery Commission is likely to obtain a court order to examine her phone and her tab records,” the deputy minister said.

He said he saw no reason as to why he should apologise to the divisional secretary.

“She and others who supported her are the ones who should apologise because it has now been proved that she and the others were involved in a fraud. The removal of GSMB officer is clear evidence that a fraud had taken place during sand mining. (Yohan Perera)
