Carol mix-up: Organizers apologize for error in hymn sheets


	

Those responsible for the error in the carol service hymnal have apologized to Archbishop Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith and the Catholic Church, a spokesman for the Colombo Archdiocese said today.

“We consider the matter closed on the basis that those responsible for the error have apologized," Archdiocesan spokesperson Fr. Edmund Tillekaratne said today.

The organizers had mistakenly printed the lyrics of gangster rapper Tupac's hit song, 'Hail Mary' on thousands of its hymn sheets.

The unfortunate mix-up took place at the Catholic 2016 Joy to the World Festival held at the Nelum Pokuna Theatre in Colombo. The festival was organized by the Archdiocese of Colombo and the Joseph Vaz Trust.

Fr Tillekaratne told Daily Mirror the matter was not really an issue because the hymn books were withdrawn. “One or two books must have got into the hands a few who must have leaked it to social media websites,” Fr. Tillekaratne said.

Meanwhile, a priest told CNN that no sooner organizers realized their mistake they had asked for the books back.

He said the printer had been a “young boy” who had simply downloaded the wrong version of the song.

“We are very sorry about what happened,” the priest said. “The page was in the middle of the booklet. Two people who had noticed it and alerted us.”

Instead of the traditional Catholic prayer, 'Blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus'; the hymn sheets had the line,  'I ain't a killer but don't push me, revenge is like the sweetest joy, Next to gettin' p***y.' (Yohan Perera)
