What a disappointment for them


	



 

The ordinary members from both sides and the members of the top team of an upcountry council were set to go on a jaunt abroad. 

 


This jaunt - euphemistically referred to as a study tour was estimated to cost the council a hefty sum running into millions which could be utilized to develop and rehabilitate the infrastructure in the province. 


The lady representing the country’s chief executive at the apex of the council’s administration too had given her sanction to this foreign tour.


Asked why she had given her approval for this foreign trip, the lady had stated that she saw no reason to object to it, because the provincial chief assured that the country’s chief executive himself had Okayed it.  However, it had transpired later that the Big Boss knew nothing about the planned foreign tour and following this revelation the lady had reproved the provincial chief for obtaining her approval under false pretenses.


Amid the raging controversy over the issue, the Big Boss issued a fiat cancelling at the eleventh hour of the planned foreign visit to Russia.  The councilors who had everything cut and dry to have a good time in Russia are said to be fuming over the disappointment caused to them.
