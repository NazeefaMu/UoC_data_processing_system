Protest against name change


	

Supporters of the Ceylon Workers Congress (CWC) yesterday staged a protest in the Kotagala town against changing the name of the Thondaman Vocational Training Centre and the playground in Hatton, which had been named after the late Minister Saumya Murthi Thondaman.

Business establishments in the town put up shutters to show their support for the protest.

The protesters marched from the Hatton-Kotagala-Nuwara-Eliya Pradheshiya Sabha office to the Kotagala town. They said that the name of the late minister could not be obliterated from the minds of the people by changing the name board of an institution. (Ranjith Rajapakse)
