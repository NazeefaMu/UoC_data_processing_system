‘Super Recognizer’ matches faces to crimes

UK: On a sticky August afternoon in 2011, as rioters looted and burned in the streets outside, a small number of police officers gathered in a room in North London.
Projected on the wall was the blurry silhouette of a man with a black woolen hat pulled deep over his forehead and a red bandanna covering all but his eyes. Security cameras across the city had tracked the man setting fire to cars, stealing from shops, beating up passers-by, even hurling gasoline bombs.
But he was always masked.
“We need to identify this fellow,” the sergeant said. “He's one of the worst.”
At that moment, Gary Collins, a constable from the local gang unit, walked in. He took one look and said, “That's Stephen Prince.”
Friends call Collins “Rain Man” or “Yoda” or simply “The Oracle.” But to Scotland Yard, London's metropolitan police force, he is known as a “super recognizer.” He has a special gift of facial recall powers that enables him to match even low-quality and partial imagery to a face he has seen before, on the street or in a database and possibly years earlier. The last time he had come face-to-face with Prince was during a fleeting encounter in 2005. Soft-spoken and gentle-mannered, Collins carries a baton and pepper spray, but no gun. His weapon is his memory: Facial recognition software managed to identify one suspect of the 4,000 captured by security cameras during the London riots. Collins identified 180.
“Computers are no match for the super recognizers,” said Detective Chief Inspector Mick Neville, head of the Central Forensic Image Team at Scotland Yard and mastermind of the squad. With its estimated 1 million security cameras, London is pioneering a new area of detection, one that could be cheaper than DNA analysis and fingerprinting and relies above all on human superpowers. Scotland Yard's ever-expanding team of 152 super recognizers is made up of men and women from across the force who score at the top end of a facial recognition test originally devised at Harvard in 2009. Collins, the star of the unit, is in the rarefied 1 percent range.
Traffic police and jailers, those patrolling neighborhoods and officers who specialize in violent crime, the super recognizers have more than tripled the number of identifications since April 2013.
They are deployed to pick out known thieves and sexual offenders in crowds of tens of thousands at rock concerts and to round up pickpockets at tourist spots like Buckingham Palace.
This year, they solved the high-profile murder of a teenage girl that had led to the mobilization 600 police officers across eight forces, the biggest search operation since the 2005 London bombings.
The term was coined in 2009 by Richard Russell, a postdoctoral researcher at Harvard. He was studying prosopagnosics, or those with face blindness, and found that about 2 percent of people had a very poor ability to recognize faces.
