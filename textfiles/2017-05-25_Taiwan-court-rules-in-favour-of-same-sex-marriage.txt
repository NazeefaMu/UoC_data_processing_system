DAILY MAIL, 24th MAY, 2017-Taiwan has become the first place in Asia to leaglise gay marriage today following a landmark ruling by the country’s top court. A panel of 14 grand justices made the ruling that current regulations prohibiting marriage between partners of the same sex are unconstitutional. 


Campaigners gathered in central Taipei today to hear the ruling. The decision by Taiwan’s  top court was posted online today. The country’s top court came to the decision that a clause in Taiwan’s Civil Code which stated marriage should be between a man and a woman was unconstitutional.  Chi Chia-wei, one of the petitioners who brought the case to the constitutional court spent 30 years campaigning for same-sex marriage in the country.  According to Hong Kong Free Press, the 59-year-old first attempted to register a marriage with his male partner in 1986.  He was imprisoned for five months.
