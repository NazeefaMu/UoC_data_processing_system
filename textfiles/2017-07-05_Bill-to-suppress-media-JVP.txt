Journalists and media institutions would have to reveal their sources in future if the new Bill on media was passed in Parliament, JVP MP Nalinda Jayatissa charged today.

“The Government is attempting to pass the Bill to suppress the media to prevent them from exposing the truth of the Unity Government,” he said.

He said the Government’s intention was to control information and to keep the people’s good impression on the Government.

He said that the same Government who baton charged students were targeting journalists and other media figures.

Speaking on the Local Government elections he charged the Government kept postponing the elections until the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) resolved its internal issues.

He said that postponement of the LG elections was a violation of Supremacy of the People in a democracy. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
